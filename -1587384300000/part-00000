They were first seen by the west in 1984 during the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]]. The GP-30 was lightened and the redesigned sighting system was moved to the right.\n\nThe current [[Izhmash]]-made version, the GP-34, has an again redesigned sighting system on the right and features the following advantages:\n* Reliability: It is designed and tested specifically for the Kalashnikov assault rifles, fits such assault rifles directly without any adaptors or forearm dismantling.<ref name=\"izhmash\" />\n* Improved safety: The design prevents a round from moving within or falling out of the barrel, even if the muzzle is pointed down. The GP-34 features an additional mechanism (firing pin safety lever) to improve safety during loading.<ref name=\"izhmash\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Ak74gp35.jpg|thumb|left|An [[AK-74]] equipped with a GP-25 grenade launcher]]\n[[File:GP-30M Interpolitex-2012.jpg|thumb|left|GP-30 grenade launcher]]\n[[File:VVday2015 56.jpg|thumb|left|GP-34 grenade launcher]]\n[[File:Kalashnikov ak74m.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|AK-74M with GP-34 grenade launcher]]\n\nDevelopment of a grenade launcher for the AK-47 assault rifle began in 1966 at the Sporting and Hunting Arms Central Design and Research Bureau. Development continued into the 1970s, and in 1978 it was accepted into service. The GP-30 first entered service in 1989, and is intended for use with the [[AK-103|AK-100]] series of assault rifles. The GP-34 is designed to be a universal service model that can be fitted to the AKM / AKMS, AK74 / AK74S, AK74M, [[AK-101]], [[AK-103]], and [[AN-94|AN-94 ''Nikonova'']] rifles.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[grenade]] launchers are similar in appearance and fire the same 40&nbsp;mm caliber ammunition and use the same [[High-Low System]] developed by Germany in late World War II to keep recoil forces low without a [[rocket]] or other type of [[recoilless weapon]] back blast.\n\nThe GP-30(M) is a stripped-down model grenade launcher, consisting of a very short, 40&nbsp;mm [[rifled]] [[Gun barrel|barrel]] in front of a basic trigger mechanism with minimal hand grip. On top of the barrel is mounting gear to attach the weapon under the barrel of an AK-series assault rifle, from where it is designed to be fired.\n\nA grenade is first muzzle loaded into the barrel, the weapon is aimed, then the self-cocking trigger is pulled to fire the weapon. This fires the [[percussion cap]] at the base of the grenade which triggers the [[nitrocellulose]] [[propellant]] inside the body of the grenade. The hot expanding gas from the propellant is forced through vents in the base of the grenade that move the grenade along the barrel, and at the same time force the driving band to engage with the twelve rifling grooves. The rifling imparts stabilizing spin to the projectile.\n\nThe barrel has a service life of about 400 rounds.\n\n==Ammunition==\nThe grenade launchers fire a series of special 40&nbsp;mm grenades. Originally, the main grenade was the VOG-15 (7P17) [[fragmentation grenade]]. This was superseded by the steel-cased VOG-25 fragmentation grenade. The VOG-25 has a lethal radius of six meters. Rounds for the muzzle-loaded GP-25 consist of a single piece containing both propellant and warhead, unlike the more traditional two piece casing-and-projectile design of the comparable American [[40mm grenade#40\u00d746mm|40x46mm]] round used in breech-loaded grenade launchers, such as the [[M203 grenade launcher|M203]].\n\nA bouncing grenade, the VOG-25P, is also available. On impact, a small charge in the nose of the grenade is detonated; this raises the grenade 0.5 to 1.5 m in the air, before an impact delay fuse detonates it. The VOG-25P also has a lethal radius of six meters.\n\nNew generation rounds VOG-M and VOG-PM with an increased effectiveness not less than 1.5 times are now serially available.<ref>https://translate.google.pl/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=pl&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fria.ru%2Finterview%2F20161110%2F1481076567.html&edit-text=&act=url</ref>\n\nSmoke grenades are also available. The original GRD-40 grenade has been replaced by a series of [[Hand grenade#Smoke|grenades]] designed for use at different ranges. These are the GRD-50, GRD-100 and GRD-200 for use at 50, 100 and 200 meters respectively. They are capable of producing a 20 square meter cloud of smoke that lasts for one minute in winds of up to five meters per second.\n\nA [[CS gas]] grenade called the ''Gvozd'' (\"Nail\") and a baton grenade are also available.\n\n===Grenades===\n[[File:VOG-25 7P17 - MAKS2015part7-50.jpg|thumb|40mm VOG-25 7P17 round of GP-25 grenade launcher]]\n* '''Fuse arming range:''' 10\u201340 m (33\u2013130&nbsp;ft)\n* '''Fuse self-destruction time:''' 14\u201319 s\n* '''VOG-25 specifications:'''\n** '''Weight:''' 250 g (0.55&nbsp;lb)\n** '''Warhead:''' 48 g of A-IX-1 explosive.\n* '''VOG-25P specifications:'''\n** '''Weight:''' 278 g (0.61&nbsp;lb)\n** '''Warhead:''' 37 g of TNT.\n* '''GRD-50/100/200 specifications'''\n** '''Weight:''' 265 g\n** '''Warhead:''' 90 g\n\n==Variants==\n* GP-25 Kostyor \n* GP-30 Obuvka \n* GP-34\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

They are capable of producing a 20 square meter cloud of smoke that lasts for one minute in winds of up to five meters per second.\n\nA [[CS gas]] grenade called the ''Gvozd'' (\"Nail\") and a baton grenade are also available.\n\n===Grenades===\n[[File:VOG-25 7P17 - MAKS2015part7-50.jpg|thumb|40mm VOG-25 7P17 round of GP-25 grenade launcher]]\n* '''Fuse arming range:''' 10\u201340 m (33\u2013130&nbsp;ft)\n* '''Fuse self-destruction time:''' 14\u201319 s\n* '''VOG-25 specifications:'''\n** '''Weight:''' 250 g (0.55&nbsp;lb)\n** '''Warhead:''' 48 g of A-IX-1 explosive.\n* '''VOG-25P specifications:'''\n** '''Weight:''' 278 g (0.61&nbsp;lb)\n** '''Warhead:''' 37 g of TNT.\n* '''GRD-50/100/200 specifications'''\n** '''Weight:''' 265 g\n** '''Warhead:''' 90 g\n\n==Variants==\n* GP-25 Kostyor \n* GP-30 Obuvka \n* GP-34\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

'''Isopods''' live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], seven pairs of jointed limbs on the [[thorax]], and five pairs of branching [[appendage]]s on the [[Abdomen#In other animals|abdomen]] that are used in [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. \n\nIsopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are [[Grazing|grazers]], or [[filter feeder]]s, a few are [[Predation|predators]], and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fish. [[Aquatic animal|Aquatic species]] mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater [[body of water|bodies of water]], but some [[Taxon|taxa]] can swim for a short distance. [[Terrestrial animal|Terrestrial]] forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defense mechanism or to conserve moisture. This is were they get their nickname \"Roley Poleys\".\n\nThere are over 10,000 species of isopod worldwide, with around 4,500 species found in marine environments, mostly on the seabed, 500 species in fresh water, and another 5,000 species on land. The order is divided into eleven [[Taxonomic rank|suborders]]. The fossil record of isopods dates back to the [[Carboniferous]] period (in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian epoch]]), at least 300&nbsp;million years ago, when isopods lived in shallow seas. The name Isopoda is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] {{wikt-lang|en|iso-}} (from {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}} {{grc-tr|\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}}, meaning \"equal\") and {{wikt-lang|en|-pod}} (from {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4-}}, the [[word stem|stem]] of {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}} {{grc-tr|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}}, meaning \"foot\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Isopod|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/isopod|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Marine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marinespecies.org/isopoda/index.php |title=World List of Marine, Freshwater and Terrestrial Isopod Crustaceans |last=Schotte |first=M. |last2=Boyko |first2=C.

At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread suborder form [[Relict (biology)|relic populations]] in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in [[Tasmania]]. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include [[Asellota]], [[Microcerberidea]], [[Calabozoidea]] and the terrestrial [[Oniscidea]].<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\nThe short-tailed isopods have a short pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods and have a sedentary lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods which can be used in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly [[Endemism|endemic]] to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]] soon after it broke away from [[Laurasia]] 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]]. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most [[Species richness|species-rich]] group of deep sea isopods.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==Locomotion==\nUnlike the amphipods, marine and freshwater isopods are entirely [[Benthos|benthic]]. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and may explain why so many species are [[Endemism|endemic]] to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the [[Flabellifera]] can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial [[Ligia|sea slaters]] (''Ligia'' spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups and also in the marine [[Sphaeromatidea|sphaeromatids]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n==Feeding and nutrition==\n[[File:Spicara flexuosa + Anilocra.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Anilocra]]'' ([[Cymothoidae]]) parasitising the fish ''[[Spicara maena]]'', Italy]]\nIsopods have a simple gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are [[Caecum|caeca]] connected to the back of the [[stomach]] in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the [[esophagus]], a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by [[peristalsis]] into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the [[hindgut]] and is eliminated through the [[anus]], which is on the pleotelson.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIsopods are [[detritivores]], [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsers]], [[carnivores]] (including [[Predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s), parasites, and [[filter feeder]]s, and may occupy one or more of these feeding niches.

In marine isopods that feed on wood, [[cellulose]] is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. ''[[Limnoria lignorum]]'', for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the [[mycelia]] of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the [[nitrogen]] in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nParasitic species are mostly external parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the [[Gnathiidae]] family and adult [[Cymothoidae|cymothoidids]] have piercing and sucking mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their [[Host (biology)|hosts]].

They are subject to evaporation, especially from their ventral area, and as they do not have a waxy cuticle, they need to conserve water, often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones, bark, debris or leaf litter. Desert species are usually nocturnal, spending the day in a burrow and emerging at night. Moisture is achieved through food sources or by drinking, and some species can form their paired uropodal appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods. In many taxa, the respiratory structures on the endopods are internal, with a [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]] and pseudotrachaea, which resemble lungs. In others, the endopod is folded inside the adjoining exopod (outer branch of the pleopod). Both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from the respiratory surfaces.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nMany species can roll themselves into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families [[Ligiidae]] and [[Tylidae]], commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land.

'''Isopods''' live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], seven pairs of jointed limbs on the [[thorax]], and five pairs of branching [[appendage]]s on the [[Abdomen#In other animals|abdomen]] that are used in [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. \n\nIsopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are [[Grazing|grazers]], or [[filter feeder]]s, a few are [[Predation|predators]], and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fish. [[Aquatic animal|Aquatic species]] mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater [[body of water|bodies of water]], but some [[Taxon|taxa]] can swim for a short distance. [[Terrestrial animal|Terrestrial]] forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defense mechanism or to conserve moisture. \n\nThere are over 10,000 species of isopod worldwide, with around 4,500 species found in marine environments, mostly on the seabed, 500 species in fresh water, and another 5,000 species on land. The order is divided into eleven [[Taxonomic rank|suborders]]. The fossil record of isopods dates back to the [[Carboniferous]] period (in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian epoch]]), at least 300&nbsp;million years ago, when isopods lived in shallow seas.

Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include [[Asellota]], [[Microcerberidea]], [[Calabozoidea]] and the terrestrial [[Oniscidea]].<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\nThe short-tailed isopods have a short pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods and have a sedentary lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods which can be used in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly [[Endemism|endemic]] to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]] soon after it broke away from [[Laurasia]] 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]]. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most [[Species richness|species-rich]] group of deep sea isopods.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==Locomotion==\nUnlike the amphipods, marine and freshwater isopods are entirely [[Benthos|benthic]]. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and may explain why so many species are [[Endemism|endemic]] to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the [[Flabellifera]] can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial [[Ligia|sea slaters]] (''Ligia'' spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups and also in the marine [[Sphaeromatidea|sphaeromatids]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n==Feeding and nutrition==\n[[File:Spicara flexuosa + Anilocra.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Anilocra]]'' ([[Cymothoidae]]) parasitising the fish ''[[Spicara maena]]'', Italy]]\nIsopods have a simple gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are [[Caecum|caeca]] connected to the back of the [[stomach]] in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the [[esophagus]], a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by [[peristalsis]] into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the [[hindgut]] and is eliminated through the [[anus]], which is on the pleotelson.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIsopods are [[detritivores]], [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsers]], [[carnivores]] (including [[Predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s), parasites, and [[filter feeder]]s, and may occupy one or more of these feeding niches.

In marine isopods that feed on wood, [[cellulose]] is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. ''[[Limnoria lignorum]]'', for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the [[mycelia]] of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the [[nitrogen]] in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nParasitic species are mostly external parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood.

They are subject to evaporation, especially from their ventral area, and as they do not have a waxy cuticle, they need to conserve water, often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones, bark, debris or leaf litter. Desert species are usually nocturnal, spending the day in a burrow and emerging at night. Moisture is achieved through food sources or by drinking, and some species can form their paired uropodal appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods. In many taxa, the respiratory structures on the endopods are internal, with a [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]] and pseudotrachaea, which resemble lungs. In others, the endopod is folded inside the adjoining exopod (outer branch of the pleopod). Both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from the respiratory surfaces.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nMany species can roll themselves into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture.

Many oil platforms will also contain facilities to accommodate their workforce. Most commonly, oil platforms engage in activities on the [[continental shelf]], though they can also be used in lakes, inshore waters, and inland seas. Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be [[fixed Platform|fixed]] to the ocean floor, consist of an [[artificial island]], or [[floating oil production system|float]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=BF|year=2005|title=Applicability ranges for offshore oil and gas production facilities|journal=Marine Structures|volume=18 |issue=3|pages=251\u2013263|doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2005.06.001}}</ref> Remote [[subsea]] wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by [[umbilical cable|umbilical]] connections. These sub-sea solutions may consist of one or more subsea wells or of one or more manifold centres for multiple wells.\n\nOffshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing [[US offshore drilling debate]].<ref>Compton, Glenn, \"[http://thebradentontimes.com/reasons-not-to-drill-for-oil-offshore-of-florida-p19415-137.htm 10 Reasons Not to Drill for Oil Offshore of Florida]\", ''The Bradenton Times'', Sunday, January 14, 2018</ref>\n\nThere are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs ([[Jackup rig|jackup barges]] and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities, either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. In shallower waters, the mobile units are anchored to the seabed. However, in deeper water (more than {{convert|1500|m|ft}}), the [[semisubmersible]]s or [[drillship]]s are maintained at the required drilling location using [[dynamic positioning]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|upright|Offshore platform, [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]\nAround 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the [[Grand Lake St. Marys]] (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in [[Ohio]]. The wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the [[Miami and Erie Canal]].\n\nAround 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the [[Summerland Oil Field|Summerland field]] extending under the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in [[California]]. The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.\n\nOther notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of [[Lake Erie]] since 1913  and [[Caddo Lake]] in [[Louisiana]] in the 1910s. Shortly thereafter, wells were drilled in tidal zones along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of [[Texas]] and Louisiana. The [[Goose Creek Oil Field|Goose Creek field]] near [[Baytown, Texas]] is one such example. In the 1920s, drilling was done from concrete platforms in [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]].\n\nThe oldest offshore well recorded in Infield's offshore database is the [[Bibiheyb\u0259t|Bibi Eibat]] well which came on stream in 1923 in [[Azerbaijan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/azmsa/oil.html|title=Oil in Azerbaijan|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref> Landfill was used to raise shallow portions of the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nIn the early 1930s, [[Texaco|the Texas Company]] developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf.\n\nIn 1937, [[Pure Oil Company]] (now [[Chevron Corporation]]) and its partner [[Superior Oil Company]] (now part of [[ExxonMobil Corporation]]) used a fixed platform to develop a field in {{convert|14|ft|m}} of water, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) offshore of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]].\n\nIn 1938, Humble Oil built  a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|date=June 2016|title=Beyond Sight of Land: A History of Oil Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico|url=https://www.academia.edu/25960555|journal=GeoExpro|volume=30|issue=3|pages=60\u201363|accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President [[Harry Truman]] to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the [[3-mile limit]] \"[[freedom of the seas]]\" regime.\n\nIn 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now [[ExxonMobil]]) drilled at a site {{convert|18|mi|km}} off the coast, erecting a platform in {{convert|18|ft|m}} of water off [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana]].\n\nIn early 1947, Superior Oil erected a drilling/production platform in {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water some 18 miles{{vague|which miles?|date=February 2010}} off [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana]]. But it was [[Kerr-McGee]] Oil Industries (now part of [[Occidental Petroleum]]), as operator for partners [[Phillips Petroleum]] ([[ConocoPhillips]]) and [[Stanolind Oil & Gas]] ([[BP]]), that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore.

It was designed by [[R. G. LeTourneau]] and featured three electro-mechanically-operated lattice type legs. Built on the shores of the [[Mississippi river]] by the LeTourneau Company, it was launched in December 1955, and christened \"Scorpion\". The Scorpion was put into operation in May 1956 off [[Port Aransas]], Texas. It was lost in 1969.<ref>http://iadc.org/dcpi/dc-septoct05/Sept05-anniversary.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://petrowiki.org/History_of_offshore_drilling_units|title=History of offshore drilling units - PetroWiki|website=petrowiki.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ibvuWmF7Dc|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\nWhen offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to {{convert|30|m|ft}}, fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the {{convert|100|ft|m}} to {{convert|120|m|ft}} depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first [[Jackup rig|jack-up rigs]] began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.\n\nThe first [[semi-submersible]] resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. [[Blue Water Drilling Company]] owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for [[Shell Oil Company]]. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by [[Edward Robert Armstrong]] for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the \"seadrome\". The first purpose-built drilling [[semi-submersible]] ''Ocean Driller'' was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.\n\nThe first offshore [[drillship]] was the ''CUSS 1'' developed for the [[Mohole]] project to drill into the Earth's crust.\n\nAs of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/data/|title=RIGZONE - Offshore Rig Data, Onshore Fleet Analysis|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne of the world's deepest hubs is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water.

Such platforms are, by virtue of their immobility, designed for very long term use (for instance the [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia platform]]). Various types of structure are used: steel jacket, concrete [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]], floating steel, and even [[Offshore concrete structure|floating concrete]]. Steel jackets are structural sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed. To see more details regarding Design, construction and installation of such platforms refer to:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/amirkabirsadeghi/jsas-002-0401sadeghi|title=An Overview of Design, Analysis, Construction and Installation of Off\u2026|date=October 31, 2013}}</ref> and.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/amirkabirsadeghi/jsas-004-077sadeghi|title=Significant Guidance for Design and Construction of Marine and Offsho\u2026|date=October 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Offshore concrete structure|Concrete caisson structures]], pioneered by the [[Condeep]] concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore ([[Norway|Norwegian]] [[fjord]]s and [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[firth]]s are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed. Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about {{convert|520|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Compliant towers===\n{{Main|Compliant Tower}}\nThese platforms consist of slender, flexible towers and a pile foundation supporting a conventional deck for drilling and production operations. Compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces, and are typically used in water depths ranging from {{convert|370|to|910|m}}.\n\n===Semi-submersible platform===\n{{Main|Semi-submersible}}\nThese platforms have hulls (columns and pontoons) of sufficient [[buoyancy]] to cause the structure to float, but of weight sufficient to keep the structure upright. Semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks. They are generally anchored by combinations of chain, wire rope or polyester rope, or both, during drilling and/or production operations, though they can also be kept in place by the use of [[dynamic positioning]]. Semi-submersibles can be used in water depths from {{convert|60|to|6000|m|sigfig=1}}.\n\n===Jack-up drilling rigs===\n[[File:Jackrigkachbay.jpg|thumb|{{convert|400|ft}} tall jackup rig being towed by tugboats, [[Kachemak Bay, Alaska]]]]\n{{Main|Jackup rig}}\nJack-up Mobile Drilling Units (or jack-ups), as the name suggests, are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered, much like [[Jack (device)|jacks]]. These MODUs (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) are typically used in water depths up to {{convert|120|m|ft}}, although some designs can go to {{convert|170|m|abbr=on}} depth. They are designed to move from place to place, and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a [[rack and pinion]] gear system on each leg.\n\n===Drillships===\n{{Main|Drillship}}\nA drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus. It is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling. Early versions were built on a modified tanker hull, but purpose-built designs are used today. Most drillships are outfitted with a [[dynamic positioning]] system to maintain position over the well. They can drill in water depths up to {{convert|3700|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chevron.com/news/press/release/?id=2010-03-11 |title=Chevron Drillship |accessdate=2010-05-24 |date=2010-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530044448/http://www.chevron.com/news/press/release/?id=2010-03-11 |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Floating production systems===\n[[File:View of the Port of Las Palmas from the dock of La Esfinge (3).jpg|View of the Port of Las Palmas from the dock of La Esfinge|thumb]]\n{{Main|Floating production, storage and offloading}}\nThe main types of floating production systems are [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading|FPSO (floating production, storage, and offloading system)]]. FPSOs consist of large monohull structures, generally (but not always) shipshaped, equipped with processing facilities. These platforms are moored to a location for extended periods, and do not actually drill for oil or gas. Some variants of these applications, called [[Floating storage and offloading unit|FSO (floating storage and offloading system)]] or FSU (floating storage unit), are used exclusively for storage purposes, and host very little process equipment. This is one of the best sources for having floating production.\n\nThe world's first [[FLNG|floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG)]] facility is currently under development. See the section on [[Oil platform#Particularly large examples|particularly large examples]] below.\n\n===Tension-leg platform===\n{{Main|Tension-leg platform}}\nTLPs are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure. TLPs are used in water depths up to about {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The \"conventional\" TLP is a 4-column design which looks similar to a semisubmersible. Proprietary versions include the Seastar and MOSES mini TLPs; they are relatively low cost, used in water depths between {{convert|180|and|1300|m}}. Mini TLPs can also be used as utility, satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries.\n\n===Gravity-based structure===\n{{Main|Gravity-based structure}}\nA GBS can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed. Steel GBS are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform, for example in the Caspian Sea. There are several steel GBS in the world today (e.g. offshore Turkmenistan Waters (Caspian Sea) and offshore New Zealand). Steel GBS do not usually provide [[hydrocarbon]] storage capability. It is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard, by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow, and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water. To position the GBS during installation, the GBS may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge (provided it is large enough to support the GBS) using strand jacks. The jacks shall be released gradually whilst the GBS is ballasted to ensure that the GBS does not sway too much from target location.\n\n===Spar platforms===\n[[File:Devils tower 2004.JPG|thumb|upright|Devil's Tower spar platform]]\n{{Main|Spar (platform)}}\nSpars are moored to the seabed like TLPs, but whereas a TLP has vertical tension tethers, a spar has more conventional mooring lines. Spars have to-date been designed in three configurations: the \"conventional\" one-piece cylindrical hull; the \"truss spar\", in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull (called a hard tank) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast; and the \"cell spar\", which is built from multiple vertical cylinders. The spar has more inherent stability than a TLP since it has a large counterweight at the bottom and does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright. It also has the ability, by adjusting the mooring line tensions (using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines), to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location. The first production spar was [[Kerr-McGee Corporation|Kerr-McGee's]] Neptune, anchored in {{convert|590|m|abbr=on}} in the Gulf of Mexico; however, spars (such as [[Brent Spar]]) were previously used as FSOs.\n\n[[Eni]]'s [[Devil's Tower (oil platform)|Devil's Tower]] located in {{convert|1710|m|abbr=on}} of water in the Gulf of Mexico, was the world's deepest spar until 2010. The world's deepest platform is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] spar in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 metres of water. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3&nbsp;billion.<ref name= UPDATE1/><ref>{{cite news|last=Fahey|first=Jonathan|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://phys.org/news/2011-12-deep-gulf-drilling-mos-bp.html|title=Deep Gulf drilling thrives 18 mos. after BP spill|date=December 30, 2011|via=Phys.org|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/7c57a1cc233d4a2d9ee7d047ef6d32cc|title=The offshore drilling life: cramped and dangerous|first=Jonathan|last=Fahley|date=December 30, 2011|work=AP News|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>\n\nThe first truss spars were Kerr-McGee's Boomvang and Nansen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\nThe first (and only) cell spar is Kerr-McGee's Red Hawk.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fmctechnologies.com/en/SubseaSystems/GlobalProjects/NorthAmerica/US/KMGRedHawk.aspx?tab=%7BB01D40AB-5E2F-4710-9543-19C658AF29F5%7D |title=First Cell Spar |accessdate=2010-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014751/http://www.fmctechnologies.com/en/SubseaSystems/GlobalProjects/NorthAmerica/US/KMGRedHawk.aspx?tab=%7BB01D40AB-5E2F-4710-9543-19C658AF29F5%7D |archive-date=2011-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Normally unmanned installations (NUI)===\n{{Main|Normally unmanned installation}}\nThese installations, sometimes called toadstools, are small platforms, consisting of little more than a [[well bay]], [[helipad]] and emergency shelter.

Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the [[Troll A platform]] standing on a depth of 300 meters.\n\nAnother type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.\n\nThe ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the [[fluid column]]. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.\n\nThe trend today is to conduct more of the production operations [[subsea]], by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than [[Pumping (oil well)|pumping]] it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters\u2014locations which had been inaccessible\u2014and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the [[Barents Sea]]. One such challenge in shallower environments is [[Seabed gouging by ice|seabed gouging by drifting ice features]] (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).\n\nOffshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the [[petroleum industry]], at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term [[integrated operations]]. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.\n\n== Effects on the environment ==\nOffshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably [[oil spill]]s from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.<ref>{{cite video|title=Debate Over Offshore Drilling|medium=internet video|work=[[CBS News]]|date=2008|url=http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|accessdate=2008-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824002817/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|archive-date=2008-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Produced water]] is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.\n\n==Deepest oil platforms==\nThe world's deepest oil platform is the floating [[Perdido (oil platform)|Perdido]], which is a [[Spar (platform)|spar platform]] in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of {{convert|2450|m}}.\n\nNon-floating compliant towers and fixed platforms, by water depth:\n\n* [[Petronius Platform]], {{convert|535|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Baldpate Platform]], {{convert|502|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Troll A|Troll A Platform]], {{convert|472|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Bullwinkle Platform]], {{convert|413|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Pompano Platform]], {{convert|393|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Benguela-Belize Lobito-Tomboco Platform]], {{convert|390|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Gullfaks C|Gullfaks C Platform]], {{convert|380|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Tombua Landana Platform]], {{convert|366|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Harmony Platform]], {{convert|366|m|abbr=on}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Accommodation platform]]\n* [[Chukchi Cap]]\n* [[Conductor support system]]\n* [[Deep sea mining]]\n* [[Deepwater drilling]]\n* [[Drillship]]\n* [[North Sea oil]]\n* [[Offshore geotechnical engineering]]\n* [[Offshore oil and gas in the United States]]\n* [[Oil drilling]]\n* [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]\n* [[SAR201]]\n* [[Shallow water drilling]]\n* [[Submarine pipeline]]\n* [[TEMPSC]]\n* [[Texas Towers]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Oil platform}}\n* [http://www.oilrigdisasters.co.uk Oil Rig Disasters] Listing of oil rig accidents\n* [http://www.oilrig-photos.com Oil Rig Photos] Collection of pictures of drilling rigs and production platforms\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020233211/http://divinglore.com/Offshore_Platforms.htm An independent review of offshore platforms in the North Sea]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080101062156/http://www.vulcanhammer.info/off/conventional.php Overview of Conventional Platforms] Pictorial treatment on the installation of platforms which extend from the seabed to the ocean surface\n\n{{Tallest buildings and structures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oil Platform}}\n[[Category:Oil platforms| ]]\n[[Category:Offshore engineering]]\n[[Category:Petroleum production]]\n[[Category:Drilling technology]]\n[[Category:Natural gas technology]]\n[[Category:Structural engineering]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Large offshore structure with oil drilling and related facilities}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Off_Shore_Drilling_Rig,_Santa_Barbara,_CA,_6_December,_2011.JPG|thumb|An oil drilling platform off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA - 6 December 2011]]\n[[File:Oil platform P-51 (Brazil).jpg|thumb|Oil platform P-51 off the [[Brazil]]ian coast is a [[semi-submersible platform]].]] \n[[File:11-09-fotofluege-cux-allg-25a.jpg|thumb|Oil platform [[Mittelplate]] in the North Sea]]\n\nAn '''oil platform''', '''offshore platform''', or '''offshore drilling rig''' is a large structure with facilities for [[well drilling]] to explore, extract, store, and process [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] that lies in rock formations beneath the seabed.

These include bottom founded drilling rigs ([[Jackup rig|jackup barges]] and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities, either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. In shallower waters, the mobile units are anchored to the seabed. However, in deeper water (more than {{convert|1500|m|ft}}), the [[semisubmersible]]s or [[drillship]]s are maintained at the required drilling location using [[dynamic positioning]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|upright|Offshore platform, [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]\nAround 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the [[Grand Lake St. Marys]] (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in [[Ohio]]. The wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the [[Miami and Erie Canal]].\n\nAround 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the [[Summerland Oil Field|Summerland field]] extending under the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in [[California]]. The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.\n\nOther notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of [[Lake Erie]] since 1913  and [[Caddo Lake]] in [[Louisiana]] in the 1910s. Shortly thereafter, wells were drilled in tidal zones along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of [[Texas]] and Louisiana. The [[Goose Creek Oil Field|Goose Creek field]] near [[Baytown, Texas]] is one such example. In the 1920s, drilling was done from concrete platforms in [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]].\n\nThe oldest offshore well recorded in Infield's offshore database is the [[Bibiheyb\u0259t|Bibi Eibat]] well which came on stream in 1923 in [[Azerbaijan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/azmsa/oil.html|title=Oil in Azerbaijan|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref> Landfill was used to raise shallow portions of the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nIn the early 1930s, [[Texaco|the Texas Company]] developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf.\n\nIn 1937, [[Pure Oil Company]] (now [[Chevron Corporation]]) and its partner [[Superior Oil Company]] (now part of [[ExxonMobil Corporation]]) used a fixed platform to develop a field in {{convert|14|ft|m}} of water, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) offshore of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]].\n\nIn 1938, Humble Oil built  a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|date=June 2016|title=Beyond Sight of Land: A History of Oil Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico|url=https://www.academia.edu/25960555|journal=GeoExpro|volume=30|issue=3|pages=60\u201363|accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President [[Harry Truman]] to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the [[3-mile limit]] \"[[freedom of the seas]]\" regime.\n\nIn 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now [[ExxonMobil]]) drilled at a site {{convert|18|mi|km}} off the coast, erecting a platform in {{convert|18|ft|m}} of water off [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana]].\n\nIn early 1947, Superior Oil erected a drilling/production platform in {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water some 18 miles{{vague|which miles?|date=February 2010}} off [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana]].

[[Blue Water Drilling Company]] owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for [[Shell Oil Company]]. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by [[Edward Robert Armstrong]] for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the \"seadrome\".

To see more details regarding Design, construction and installation of such platforms refer to:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/amirkabirsadeghi/jsas-002-0401sadeghi|title=An Overview of Design, Analysis, Construction and Installation of Off\u2026|date=October 31, 2013}}</ref> and.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/amirkabirsadeghi/jsas-004-077sadeghi|title=Significant Guidance for Design and Construction of Marine and Offsho\u2026|date=October 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Offshore concrete structure|Concrete caisson structures]], pioneered by the [[Condeep]] concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore ([[Norway|Norwegian]] [[fjord]]s and [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[firth]]s are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed. Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about {{convert|520|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Compliant towers===\n{{Main article|Compliant Tower}}\nThese platforms consist of slender, flexible towers and a pile foundation supporting a conventional deck for drilling and production operations. Compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces, and are typically used in water depths ranging from {{convert|370|to|910|m}}.\n\n===Semi-submersible platform===\n{{Main article|Semi-submersible}}\nThese platforms have hulls (columns and pontoons) of sufficient [[buoyancy]] to cause the structure to float, but of weight sufficient to keep the structure upright. Semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks. They are generally anchored by combinations of chain, wire rope or polyester rope, or both, during drilling and/or production operations, though they can also be kept in place by the use of [[dynamic positioning]]. Semi-submersibles can be used in water depths from {{convert|60|to|6000|m|sigfig=1}}.\n\n===Jack-up drilling rigs===\n[[File:Jackrigkachbay.jpg|thumb|{{convert|400|ft}} tall jackup rig being towed by tugboats, [[Kachemak Bay, Alaska]]]]\n{{Main article|Jackup rig}}\nJack-up Mobile Drilling Units (or jack-ups), as the name suggests, are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered, much like [[Jack (device)|jacks]]. These MODUs (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) are typically used in water depths up to {{convert|120|m|ft}}, although some designs can go to {{convert|170|m|abbr=on}} depth. They are designed to move from place to place, and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a [[rack and pinion]] gear system on each leg.\n\n===Drillships===\n{{Main article|Drillship}}\nA drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus. It is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling. Early versions were built on a modified tanker hull, but purpose-built designs are used today. Most drillships are outfitted with a [[dynamic positioning]] system to maintain position over the well. They can drill in water depths up to {{convert|3700|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chevron.com/news/press/release/?id=2010-03-11 |title=Chevron Drillship |accessdate=2010-05-24 |date=2010-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530044448/http://www.chevron.com/news/press/release/?id=2010-03-11 |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Floating production systems===\n[[File:View of the Port of Las Palmas from the dock of La Esfinge (3).jpg|View of the Port of Las Palmas from the dock of La Esfinge|thumb]]\n{{Main article|Floating production, storage and offloading}}\nThe main types of floating production systems are [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading|FPSO (floating production, storage, and offloading system)]]. FPSOs consist of large monohull structures, generally (but not always) shipshaped, equipped with processing facilities. These platforms are moored to a location for extended periods, and do not actually drill for oil or gas. Some variants of these applications, called [[Floating storage and offloading unit|FSO (floating storage and offloading system)]] or FSU (floating storage unit), are used exclusively for storage purposes, and host very little process equipment. This is one of the best sources for having floating production.\n\nThe world's first [[FLNG|floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG)]] facility is currently under development. See the section on [[Oil platform#Particularly large examples|particularly large examples]] below.\n\n===Tension-leg platform===\n{{Main article|Tension-leg platform}}\nTLPs are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure. TLPs are used in water depths up to about {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The \"conventional\" TLP is a 4-column design which looks similar to a semisubmersible. Proprietary versions include the Seastar and MOSES mini TLPs; they are relatively low cost, used in water depths between {{convert|180|and|1300|m}}. Mini TLPs can also be used as utility, satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries.\n\n===Gravity-based structure===\n{{Main article|Gravity-based structure}}\nA GBS can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed. Steel GBS are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform, for example in the Caspian Sea. There are several steel GBS in the world today (e.g. offshore Turkmenistan Waters (Caspian Sea) and offshore New Zealand). Steel GBS do not usually provide [[hydrocarbon]] storage capability. It is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard, by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow, and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water. To position the GBS during installation, the GBS may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge (provided it is large enough to support the GBS) using strand jacks. The jacks shall be released gradually whilst the GBS is ballasted to ensure that the GBS does not sway too much from target location.\n\n===Spar platforms===\n[[File:Devils tower 2004.JPG|thumb|upright|Devil's Tower spar platform]]\n{{Main article|Spar (platform)}}\nSpars are moored to the seabed like TLPs, but whereas a TLP has vertical tension tethers, a spar has more conventional mooring lines. Spars have to-date been designed in three configurations: the \"conventional\" one-piece cylindrical hull; the \"truss spar\", in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull (called a hard tank) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast; and the \"cell spar\", which is built from multiple vertical cylinders. The spar has more inherent stability than a TLP since it has a large counterweight at the bottom and does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright. It also has the ability, by adjusting the mooring line tensions (using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines), to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location. The first production spar was [[Kerr-McGee Corporation|Kerr-McGee's]] Neptune, anchored in {{convert|590|m|abbr=on}} in the Gulf of Mexico; however, spars (such as [[Brent Spar]]) were previously used as FSOs.\n\n[[Eni]]'s [[Devil's Tower (oil platform)|Devil's Tower]] located in {{convert|1710|m|abbr=on}} of water in the Gulf of Mexico, was the world's deepest spar until 2010. The world's deepest platform is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] spar in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 metres of water. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3 billion.<ref name= UPDATE1/><ref>{{cite news|last=Fahey|first=Jonathan|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://phys.org/news/2011-12-deep-gulf-drilling-mos-bp.html|title=Deep Gulf drilling thrives 18 mos. after BP spill|date=December 30, 2011|via=Phys.org|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/7c57a1cc233d4a2d9ee7d047ef6d32cc|title=The offshore drilling life: cramped and dangerous|first=Jonathan|last=Fahley|date=December 30, 2011|work=AP News|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>\n\nThe first truss spars were Kerr-McGee's Boomvang and Nansen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\nThe first (and only) cell spar is Kerr-McGee's Red Hawk.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fmctechnologies.com/en/SubseaSystems/GlobalProjects/NorthAmerica/US/KMGRedHawk.aspx?tab=%7BB01D40AB-5E2F-4710-9543-19C658AF29F5%7D |title=First Cell Spar |accessdate=2010-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014751/http://www.fmctechnologies.com/en/SubseaSystems/GlobalProjects/NorthAmerica/US/KMGRedHawk.aspx?tab=%7BB01D40AB-5E2F-4710-9543-19C658AF29F5%7D |archive-date=2011-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Normally unmanned installations (NUI)===\n{{Main article|Normally unmanned installation}}\nThese installations, sometimes called toadstools, are small platforms, consisting of little more than a [[well bay]], [[helipad]] and emergency shelter.

Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the [[Troll A platform]] standing on a depth of 300 meters.\n\nAnother type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.\n\nThe ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the [[fluid column]]. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.\n\nThe trend today is to conduct more of the production operations [[subsea]], by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than [[Pumping (oil well)|pumping]] it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters\u2014locations which had been inaccessible\u2014and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the [[Barents Sea]]. One such challenge in shallower environments is [[Seabed gouging by ice|seabed gouging by drifting ice features]] (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).\n\nOffshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the [[petroleum industry]], at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term [[integrated operations]]. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.\n\n== Effects on the environment ==\nOffshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably [[oil spill]]s from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.<ref>{{cite video|title=Debate Over Offshore Drilling|medium=internet video|work=[[CBS News]]|date=2008|url=http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|accessdate=2008-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824002817/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|archive-date=2008-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Produced water]] is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.\n\n==Deepest oil platforms==\nThe world's deepest oil platform is the floating [[Perdido (oil platform)|Perdido]], which is a [[Spar (platform)|spar platform]] in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of {{convert|2450|m}}.\n\nNon-floating compliant towers and fixed platforms, by water depth:\n\n* [[Petronius Platform]], {{convert|535|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Baldpate Platform]], {{convert|502|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Troll A|Troll A Platform]], {{convert|472|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Bullwinkle Platform]], {{convert|413|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Pompano Platform]], {{convert|393|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Benguela-Belize Lobito-Tomboco Platform]], {{convert|390|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Gullfaks C|Gullfaks C Platform]], {{convert|380|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Tombua Landana Platform]], {{convert|366|m|abbr=on}}\n* [[Harmony Platform]], {{convert|366|m|abbr=on}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Accommodation platform]]\n* [[Chukchi Cap]]\n* [[Conductor support system]]\n* [[Deep sea mining]]\n* [[Deepwater drilling]]\n* [[Drillship]]\n* [[Jackup barge]]\n* [[North Sea oil]]\n* [[Offshore concrete structure]]\n* [[Offshore geotechnical engineering]]\n* [[Offshore oil and gas in the United States]]\n* [[Oil drilling]]\n* [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]\n* [[Rigs-to-Reefs]]\n* [[SAR201]]\n* [[Semi-submersible]]\n* [[Shallow water drilling]]\n* [[Submarine pipeline]]\n* [[Subsea]]\n* [[TEMPSC]]\n* [[Texas Towers]]\n* [[United States offshore drilling debate]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Oil platform}}\n* [http://www.oilrigdisasters.co.uk Oil Rig Disasters] Listing of oil rig accidents\n* [http://www.oilrig-photos.com Oil Rig Photos] Collection of pictures of drilling rigs and production platforms\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020233211/http://divinglore.com/Offshore_Platforms.htm An independent review of offshore platforms in the North Sea]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080101062156/http://www.vulcanhammer.info/off/conventional.php Overview of Conventional Platforms] Pictorial treatment on the installation of platforms which extend from the seabed to the ocean surface\n\n{{Tallest buildings and structures}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oil Platform}}\n[[Category:Oil platforms| ]]\n[[Category:Offshore engineering]]\n[[Category:Petroleum production]]\n[[Category:Drilling technology]]\n[[Category:Natural gas technology]]\n[[Category:Structural engineering]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: 3 billion \u2192 3\u00a0billion (4)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_platform"}

With a population of 8,532 as of 2016, Bridgewater is the largest town in the [[Southern Nova Scotia|South Shore]] region.\n\nPriding itself as \"The Main Street of the South Shore,\" Bridgewater has long been established as the primary commercial and professional service centre in the southern half of the province. The community boasts a diverse local economy, as well as larger national and international employers.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first [[Europe]]an settlers of the town came from the nearby settlements of [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]], [[Riverport, Nova Scotia|Riverport]] and [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave]], constructing the first house around 1810 on the west bank of the river (although the first house in what is now the town was built before 1803).\n\nThe town was named after the bridge built over the LaHave River.  The commissioners for the construction of the first bridge were three brothers-in-law, George Heb, John Weil and John Vienot.\n\nThe town was incorporated on February 13, 1899, one month after the Great Commercial Street Fire, which devastated the downtown core of the community, destroying buildings along both sides of what would become King Street for more than half a kilometre. The fire, which occurred on the night of January 12, 1899, is believed to have begun in the basement of the old music hall, located at what would, today, be the intersection of King and Dominion Streets.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the town's economy depended on [[forestry]] and a large wood mill in the center of town, as well as the [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway|Nova Scotia Central Railway]] and later the [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]], for which the town acted as a central hub for the South Shore region.  The Acadia Marine Engine Company was based in Bridgewater and it made fish boat and coaster engines.\n\nA period of some stagnation occurred beginning in the mid-1950s until a new [[Michelin]] plant opened within town limits in the early 1970s, providing employment for some 1,000 people. The abandoned passenger train station burnt to the ground in the early 1980s, shortly after a revitalization plan was announced. Freight rail service continued to the town until the early 1990s when Canadian National Railway abandoned the line and the tracks were removed. The rail yard property on the east bank of the LaHave River is now occupied by the Bridgewater Mall (now known as the South Shore Centre) and various retail businesses.\n\nSince the 1990s, the town has tried with some success to come up with solutions for problems that have crippled other areas of the [[Maritime provinces]]: economic decline and an aging population. Encouraging Bridgewater's growth as a commercial and professional services centre, promoting artistic, athletic, and environmentally conscious initiatives, and refreshing aging municipal infrastructure has helped to strengthen the community's position in the early 21st century.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBridgewater is split in two by the [[LaHave River]], with the majority of the town's land area situated on the western bank of the river. The town spans the LaHave River Valley and is dominated by hills that lead down to the river. Elevation ranges from 5 metres above sea level (at the river), to nearly 110 m at the highest point at the former Olde Towne Golf Course (now slated for a housing development) on the southwestern limit of the town. The surrounding area is characterized by rolling [[drumlins]] formed during the [[last glacial period]], some of which reach 150 m above sea level. There are also several streams which empty into the river. The LaHave River is traversed by two bridges in the centre of the town, and a [[Nova Scotia Provincial Highway 103|103 highway]] overpass and a foot bridge (formerly a railway crossing) towards the northern limits.\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n\nOn a basic level, the town is split in two by the LaHave River. The western bank of the river was the area first developed more than 200 years ago. Today it remains the most heavily populated part of the town and is home to the Bridgewater Industrial Park (where [[Michelin]] is located) and most other civic amenities. The eastern bank of the river was home, for many years, to a large lumber yard and [[Halifax and South Western Railway|train station]]. This area developed rapidly in the last quarter of the 20th century with the arrival of the Bridgewater Mall and a large subdivision. Today, this area remains the commercial heart of the town and the centre of population growth. In the 2011 census, the eastern side of town held 37% of the total population, up from 33% in 2006. Compared to the previous census, the population of the western side of town declined 2%, while the eastern side increased by 16%.\n\nThere are few distinctive neighbourhoods in the town, and most designations rely solely on subdivision names. The Pinecrest Subdivision and low income housing centered along Marie Avenue remain the only major large-scale residential development on the western side of the town in the last 25 years, while the eastern flank has seen rapid growth, including the Glen Allan Subdivision, and two large mobile home parks. Most of these areas, however, are built-out, so development is now spilling out into the county. Just outside the town's limits, [[Hebbville, Nova Scotia|Hebbville]] has seen the development of the now older Catidian Place and the much more recent Botany Lane, while bordering Conquerall Bank is hosting the still-growing Meadowbrook Subdivision, arguably the most upscale development in the Bridgewater area although lack of paved roads negates a lot of the positives for the community. The Cookville area also continues to see growth in the Osprey Ridge area. With the exception of Glen Allan, most new residential developments within town limits are the result of urban [[infill]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nBridgewater experiences a [[humid continental climate]], as does most of eastern Canada. The [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]]'s proximity to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] influences the climate to a significant degree, such that the region is usually somewhat milder than most of Canada during the winter months. Nevertheless, winters are generally cold, damp and generally overcast with snowfall occurring often, as well as frequent rain. Summers, while usually less extreme than inland central Canada, are warm to hot and generally quite humid, accented by occasional storms and showers. Autumn and spring are often wildly unpredictable, and snowfall as early as the first week of October is not unheard of.\n\nBecause it lies inland from the ocean, it is usually warmer than coastal Nova Scotia during the summer, and reports far fewer foggy days.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Bridgewater, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1961\u2013present\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  =

While the population of many Nova Scotia communities is lower now than in 1951 (including Sydney, New Glasgow, Amherst and Yarmouth, among others), Bridgewater has almost doubled its population during that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www66.statcan.gc.ca/eng/acyb_c1955-eng.aspx?opt%3D%2Feng%2F1955%2F195501660140_p.+140.pdf |title=Canada Year Book 1955|page=140|publisher=Statistics Canada  |accessdate=2012-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606105957/http://www66.statcan.gc.ca/eng/acyb_c1955-eng.aspx?opt=%2Feng%2F1955%2F195501660140_p.%20140.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-06 }}</ref> There was a strong boom in population between 1961 and 1981 in particular, this reflecting the arrival of Michelin tire plant in the community.\n\nLike many communities in Nova Scotia, the population of Bridgewater has aged considerably over the last several censuses. As of the 2016 census, the average age of a resident was 46.8 years, one year younger than the surrounding county, but more than three years older than the province as a whole.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While the community is known for its commercial offerings and is generally accepted as being less tourism-driven compared to its municipal neighbours Lunenburg and [[Mahone Bay (town)|Mahone Bay]],\n\nHowever, the town boasts a number of unique cultural events, including the annual Bridgewater Garden Party hosted at the DesBrisay Museum, Christmas on the LaHave, the [http://www.bridgewater.ca/growinggreenfest Growing Green Sustainability Festival], and [http://www.afterglowbridgewater.com/ Afterglow Art Festival].<ref>[http://www.thebigex.com South Shore Exhibition]</ref> The largest annual festival is the [http://www.thebigex.com South Shore Exhibition, which dates to 1891.] The \"Big Ex,\" as it is locally known, is a week-long agricultural fair that is held each July, attracting around 50,000 people. While honoring the area's agricultural heritage, the Big Ex also includes multiple nights of live entertainment on the South Shore Exhibition Grounds. One of its traditional featured events is the International Ox Pull, bringing together teams come from the [[Maritimes]] and the [[Northeastern United States]].<ref name=\"ox\">{{cite web|url=http://nfb.ca/film/dont_knock_the_ox/|title=Don't Knock the Ox|author=[[Tony Ianzelo]]|year=1970|work=Documentary film|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nCommunity music has been a part of Bridgewater's heritage for almost a century and a half.  The Bridgewater Fire Department Band has been a fixture in the town since 1868.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://bfdband.com/about-us-1 |publisher=Bridgewater Fire Department Band |accessdate=December 25, 2019}}</ref>  The South Shore Chorale, a seventy-voice mixed chorus, has been active since the 1960s.  For many years, the Hospital Chorus and Drama Society (now defunct) helped to raise funds for the Dawson Memorial Hospital (later South Shore Regional Hospital) through its production of Broadway-style musicals.\n\nIn 2014, the [http://artinbridgewater.weebly.com/ Art Happening] was established to create a thriving community art space in Bridgewater. Inspired by the 'Art Hive' movement in Montreal, the group of motivated and enthusiastic community members developed the idea of a free/low cost art building focused on creativity for people of all ages and backgrounds. Today, Art Happening is a not-for-profit organization that strives on fun classes, stress relief, and creativity in all shapes and forms.\n\nLike much of Lunenburg County, many of Bridgewater's residents can trace their lineage back to the Foreign Protestants who arrived in Nova Scotia 18th century. While much of that original culture has been lost, a few remnants remain. Lunenburg pudding, a type of pork sausage, is still widely available, and some residents still speak in an accent unique to the county, dubbed [[Lunenburg English]], featuring one of the few [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] speech patterns remaining in Canada.\n\n== Education and health ==\nThe town is primarily served by Bridgewater Elementary<ref>[http://www.bes.ednet.ns.ca Bridgewater Elementary School]</ref> and [[Bridgewater Junior Senior High School]]s,<ref>[http://bridgewater.ednet.ns.ca Junior/Senior High School]</ref> both located on York Street, near downtown. These aging facilities manage to serve the needs of the town's youth, but lack near-by athletic fields.  [[Park View Education Centre]],<ref>[http://www.pvec.ednet.ns.ca Park View Education Centre]</ref> located at the northern edge of the town, serves grades 10-12 and takes part in the [[International Baccalaureate Organization|International Baccalaureate]] program.  This facility mainly acts as a collector school for students from the rural areas of the county, although some Bridgewater residents do attend as well.  Centre Scolaire de la Rive-Sud, opened in 2010 in Cookville (just outside the town limits) is a French education school, part of Nova Scotia's Acadian school system (CSAP - Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial), offering a primarily French-language education to Francophone families in the area. The Lunenburg campus of the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] is located on High Street, sharing space with the local [[YMCA]]. The town also has two provincial museums, [[DesBrisay Museum|The DesBrisay]] and the [[Wile Carding Mill]], and a central library.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, of the town's population between ages 20\u201364, 24.3% had not received a high school diploma while 56% had received at least some sort of post secondary degree or certificate. Both figures were slightly better than the average for Nova Scotia (25.3% and 54%, respectively), and significantly better than the larger Lunenburg County (30.1% and 50.9%) and neighbouring [[Queens County, Nova Scotia|Queens County]] (37% and 42%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=1206004&Geo2=PR&Code2=12&Data=Count&SearchText=bridgewater&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Education&Custom=|title=2001 Community Profiles|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBridgewater is served by the [[South Shore Regional Hospital]]<ref>{{cite web |title=South Shore Regional Hospital |url=http://www.nshealth.ca/locations-details/South%20Shore%20Regional%20Hospital |publisher=Nova Scotia Health Authority |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> located on Glen Allen Drive. This facility, inaugurated in 1988, replaced the 1960s-era Dawson Memorial Hospital located on the south western side of the town. The SSRH serves as the major hospital in the county and offers most standard services.\n\n== Industry and employment ==\nMost employment in the town is in the commercial and professional service sector, although tire-manufacturer Michelin remains by far the single largest employer. The town's second largest employer is Millennium 1 Solutions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millennium1solutions.com |title=Millennium 1 Solutions}}</ref> a call-centre, and other major employers are South Shore Health, [[Atlantic Superstore]], [[Sobeys]] and [[Walmart]].\n\nIn 2005, the average earnings for all census families was $49,754, more than $4,500 below the provincial average. For married couples, this figure was $56,275, and for single parents, it was $26,362.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=1206004&Geo2=PR&Code2=12&Data=Count&SearchText=bridgewater&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= |title=2006 Community Profiles|publisher=Statistics Canada|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\nWhile the town has no local television stations, it is served by [[CKBW-FM]] radio, an award-winning broadcaster, [[CJHK-FM]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109025054/http://southshorenow.ca/  Lighthouse Publishing], which operates a popular media portal.  CKBW, established in 1947, gave acclaimed actor Donald Sutherland his start in the media at age 14 while he was living in the town. The CKBW News team has received two regional RTNDA Awards and has been a finalist for an Atlantic Journalism Award.  CKBW-FM has shifted its music focus several times over the past two decades, and now airs mostly contemporary pop music. It recently began operating sister-station Hank-FM, which airs country and western style music. The weekly Lighthouse Now (formerly Bridgewater Bulletin) has been in publication since 1888 and had won numerous awards for its content and lay-out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southshorenow.ca/about/history/index.php |title=A Brief History |publisher=Lighthouse Publishing Ltd. |accessdate=2008-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033135/http://www.southshorenow.ca/about/history/index.php |archivedate=2008-01-05 }}</ref> The company also distributes the Lighthouse Log, a free weekend paper.\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nAfter a period of stagnation, recreation facilities in the town have undergone a modernization in recent years.\n\nIn 2008, construction began on the HB Studios Sports Centre, known locally as \"The Fieldhouse,\" a $1.7 million indoor turf, track, and amenities facility located on Glen Allan Drive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007/011707/news&article=1|title=Indoor athletic facility proposed|date=17 January 2007|archive-date=6 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203644/http://www.southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007%2F011707%2Fnews&article=1|access-date=23 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the town and Municipality of Lunenburg teamed up to construct an additional multi-purpose facility, the Lunenburg County Lifestyle Centre (LCLC) on North Park Street. That facility features the Clearwater Seafoods Arena (seating capacity for hockey is 1,200), the BMO Aquatic Centre, and the Margaret Hennigar Public Library.\n\nFollowing the opening of the LCLC, Bridgewater ceased operations at the 65-year-old Bridgewater Memorial Arena in 2015. The Town of Bridgewater also continues to operate an outdoor swimming pool during the summer months on Jubilee Road, located near the DesBrisay Museum.\n\nIn terms of other outdoor facilities, the town is home to the Kinsmen Field (a soccer/football field, baseball diamond), the LaHave baseball/softball/soccer fields on Glen Allen Drive, the Bridgewater Curling Club, and the Bridgewater Tennis Club.\n\nResidents of Bridgewater enjoy a relatively extensive parks system, which the town estimates at {{convert|100|acre|km2}}. This, however, does not include open green space within the town, the inclusion of which would give a much higher total.\n\nThe crown jewel of the parks system continues to be the {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} Woodland Gardens, locally known at the \"Duck Pond.\" This park includes the DesBrisay Museum, one of the town's public swimming pools, a large pond and various trails. Shipyards Landing is a large public park located at the reclaimed site of the former Acadia Gas Engine Company. Situated on south King Street along the LaHave River, the area features berthing for boaters and kayakers, picnic and open space, and is often used as a gathering point for festivals, such as Canada on the LaHave.\n\nOther parks include Pinecrest and Glen Allen, both playgrounds, and Riverview Park, overlooking the rapids of the LaHave River. The system also includes smaller parks, such as King Street Court and Pijinuiskaq Park, located in the heart of the downtown, as well as the eight kilometre [[Trans Canada Trail|Centennial Trail]], which was constructed on abandoned rail lines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bridgewater.ca/ |title=Parks and Trails |publisher=Town of Bridgewater|access-date=23 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2017, the town opened the South Shore Vet Doz Zone (off-leash park) at Generations Active Park, 18 acres of dedicated parkland near HB Studios Sports Centre. The dog park is the first in a multi-year, multi-phase plan to develop the Generations Active Park lands for recreational use by town residents and visitors.\n\n[[File:Bridgewater Cemetery, Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.jpg|1020px|thumb|center|The Bridgewater Cemetery provides a park-like setting for quiet and reflection.]]\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:NSRoute331.png|thumb|180px|Route 331 runs parallel to the LaHave River in Bridgewater.]]The [[LaHave River]] was the main transportation route in historic times, though today it is mainly used for pleasure craft and recreational boating. A cable ferry located in [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave]] is the only crossing downriver from Bridgewater. The [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] once passed through the town but the line is now abandoned. The main road serving the town is [[Nova Scotia Highway 103|Highway 103]], which has two primary exits entering the town. Trunk highways [[Nova Scotia Trunk 10|10]] and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 3|3]] meet at Bridgewater. Other provincial highways are [[Nova Scotia Route 325|Route 325]] and [[Nova Scotia Route 331|Route 331]].\n\nAs the town continues to grow, traffic flow and congestion is of concern. Complicating matters is that Bridgewater draws on a number of satellite communities and, on any given day, Bridgewater's functional population doubles from 8,200 to between 16,000 and 20,000 because of the volume of people from the surrounding areas who come to the town to work, shop, and play. The town's geography and two bridge crossings within town limits also can amplify traffic disruption when construction work forces the temporary closure of one of the main routes.\n\nA public transit pilot for the town began operating in the fall of 2017. The initiative was made permanent in 2019 as the popularity of the service exceeded expectations.<ref>[http://ckbw.ca/news/1065787056/bridgewater-transit-here-stay Bridgewater Transit Is Here to Stay], CKBW Radio, February 26, 2019.

The town's core features a unique combination of traditional, locally owned shops and services on the west bank of the LaHave River (King Street) and a mix of larger, modern box stores on the east bank of the river (LaHave Street).\n\nThe [http://www.bridgewatermall.ca/ Bridgewater Mall], first developed in the 1970s, replaced an old rail yard, and continues to be a strong part of the commercial heart of the town. There was a major renovation of the area in the 1980s, which the addition of Eastside Plaza, and after the Bridgewater Mall properties were sold by Crombie Properties to Zenda Group in 2011, the new owners carried out a $9 million renovation of the mall, in the process bringing a number of new, high-profile tenants, including Sport Chek, and Winners. The Bridgewater Mall also features Sobey's as an anchor tenant at the south end of the site, as well as Cineplex/ and the [[Atlantic Superstore]] are located nearby on the LaHave Street side of downtown.\n\nThe Gateway (Bridgewater) Plaza, located in the southern area of town near the [[Nova Scotia Community College]], continues to thrive despite a changing landscape. While [Zellers] closed in the mid-1990s and Canadian Tire relocated to [[Cookville, Nova Scotia|Cookville]] in 2006, the plaza underwent a renovation and is now anchored by discount grocery chain [[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]] and [[Giant Tiger]], both of which opened in 2010. The No Frills location was previously a [[Save Easy]] and before that an [[IGA (supermarkets)|IGA]], and has been in continual operation as a grocery store for nearly 50 years despite the name changes.\n\nThe South Shore Mall, located on the eastern edge of town, once home to a movie theatre, grocery and department store, had been completely abandoned by the late 1990s and had been slated for redevelopment as a convention centre, hotel, apartment buildings and shops,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007/021407/news&article=1|title=Former mall property plans unveiled|date=February 14, 2007|publisher=Lighthouse Media Group|archive-date=6 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203924/http://southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007%2F021407%2Fnews&article=1|access-date=15 June 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> although no progress has occurred on the site as of mid-2019.\n\n== Redevelopment of King Street ==\nIn 2012, Town Council commission a study into the potential redevelopment of King Street as a more community focused center. Released in 2013, the Downtown and Waterfront Master Plan (DWMP) is a 100-plus page document designed to guide the economic and social development of Downtown Bridgewater over the next 20 to 30 years.\n\nThe first phase of implementing the DWMP began in 2015 with the demolition of the South Parkade. The 45-year-old steel and concrete structure was removed and, during 2016, a major infrastructure project was undertaken in the Old Bridge-to-Dufferin block of King Street.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bridgewater.ca/town-services/planning/downtownplan/project-updates |title=Project Updates |access-date=2015-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216222649/http://bridgewater.ca/town-services/planning/downtownplan/project-updates |archive-date=2015-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe project, known as Take Back The Riverbank, included three main components: first, the removal and replacement of existing decades-old water and sewer infrastructure below King Street; second, the reconstruction of the street, including the introduction of better sidewalks, curb bump outs, and street furniture, all designed to make the downtown more pedestrian friendly; and, the construction of Pijinuiskaq Park along the riverbank on the former parkade site. Pijinuiskaq is the historic Mi'kmaq name for the LaHave River.\n\nIn 2016, Bridgewater Town Council agreed to grant $51,000 to allow for the creation of the Bridgewater Facade Improvement Society. The Society oversees a Facade Improvement Program, which invites commercial tenants or property owners in the King Street Architectural Control Area to apply for matching funding of up to $5,000 in matching funding for facade improvement projects. The program covers improvements ranging from painting to signage, lighting, and more.\n\n[[File:East side of Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.JPG|thumb|center|1020px|A view from the east bank of the LaHave River midway between the two bridges.]]\n\n== Crime ==\nOfficial crime statistics are not available for Bridgewater. Violent crime is rare and most crime stems from petty property damage, and drug offenses. The highest profile crime to occur in the town took place in 2008 with the murder of 12-year-old Karissa Boudreau, a crime for which her mother was eventually convicted. The [[Bridgewater Police Service]],<ref>[http://www.bridgewaterpolice.ca/ Bridgewater Police Service]</ref> as well as recently relocating to a new, modern facility, has moved towards community based policing, working closely with [[Neighborhood watch|Neighbourhood Watch]] programs and local schools, as well as adding foot and bicycle patrols in areas that squad cars are unable to reach.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bridgewater.ca/crime-prevention/community-policing.html |title=Community Policing |access-date=2008-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108030314/http://www.bridgewater.ca/crime-prevention/community-policing.html |archive-date=2008-01-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Bridgewater Police Service is governed by the Bridgewater Police Commission.

With a population of 8,532 as of 2016, Bridgewater is the largest town in the [[Southern Nova Scotia|South Shore]] region.\n\nPriding itself as \"The Main Street of the South Shore,\" Bridgewater has long been established as the primary commercial and professional service centre in the southern half of the province. The community boasts a diverse local economy, as well as larger national and international employers.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first [[Europe]]an settlers of the town came from the nearby settlements of [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]], [[Riverport, Nova Scotia|Riverport]] and [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave]], constructing the first house around 1810 on the west bank of the river (although the first house in what is now the town was built before 1803).\n\nThe town was named after the bridge built over the LaHave River.  The commissioners for the construction of the first bridge were three brothers-in-law, George Heb, John Weil and John Vienot.\n\nThe town was incorporated on February 13, 1899, one month after the Great Commercial Street Fire, which devastated the downtown core of the community, destroying buildings along both sides of what would become King Street for more than half a kilometre. The fire, which occurred on the night of January 12, 1899, is believed to have begun in the basement of the old music hall, located at what would, today, be the intersection of King and Dominion Streets.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the town's economy depended on [[forestry]] and a large wood mill in the center of town, as well as the [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway|Nova Scotia Central Railway]] and later the [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]], for which the town acted as a central hub for the South Shore region.  The Acadia Marine Engine Company was based in Bridgewater and it made fish boat and coaster engines.\n\nA period of some stagnation occurred beginning in the mid-1950s until a new [[Michelin]] plant opened within town limits in the early 1970s, providing employment for some 1,000 people. The abandoned passenger train station burnt to the ground in the early 1980s, shortly after a revitalization plan was announced. Freight rail service continued to the town until the early 1990s when Canadian National Railway abandoned the line and the tracks were removed. The rail yard property on the east bank of the LaHave River is now occupied by the Bridgewater Mall (now known as the South Shore Centre) and various retail businesses.\n\nSince the 1990s, the town has tried with some success to come up with solutions for problems that have crippled other areas of the [[Maritime provinces]]: economic decline and an aging population. Encouraging Bridgewater's growth as a commercial and professional services centre, promoting artistic, athletic, and environmentally conscious initiatives, and refreshing aging municipal infrastructure has helped to strengthen the community's position in the early 21st century.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBridgewater is split in two by the [[LaHave River]], with the majority of the town's land area situated on the western bank of the river. The town spans the LaHave River Valley and is dominated by hills that lead down to the river. Elevation ranges from 5 metres above sea level (at the river), to nearly 110 m at the highest point at the former Olde Towne Golf Course (now slated for a housing development) on the southwestern limit of the town. The surrounding area is characterized by rolling [[drumlins]] formed during the [[last glacial period]], some of which reach 150 m above sea level. There are also several streams which empty into the river. The LaHave River is traversed by two bridges in the centre of the town, and a [[Nova Scotia Provincial Highway 103|103 highway]] overpass and a foot bridge (formerly a railway crossing) towards the northern limits.\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n\nOn a basic level, the town is split in two by the LaHave River. The western bank of the river was the area first developed more than 200 years ago. Today it remains the most heavily populated part of the town and is home to the Bridgewater Industrial Park (where [[Michelin]] is located) and most other civic amenities. The eastern bank of the river was home, for many years, to a large lumber yard and [[Halifax and South Western Railway|train station]]. This area developed rapidly in the last quarter of the 20th century with the arrival of the Bridgewater Mall and a large subdivision. Today, this area remains the commercial heart of the town and the centre of population growth. In the 2011 census, the eastern side of town held 37% of the total population, up from 33% in 2006. Compared to the previous census, the population of the western side of town declined 2%, while the eastern side increased by 16%.\n\nThere are few distinctive neighbourhoods in the town, and most designations rely solely on subdivision names. The Pinecrest Subdivision and low income housing centered along Marie Avenue remain the only major large-scale residential development on the western side of the town in the last 25 years, while the eastern flank has seen rapid growth, including the Glen Allan Subdivision, and two large mobile home parks. Most of these areas, however, are built-out, so development is now spilling out into the county. Just outside the town's limits, [[Hebbville, Nova Scotia|Hebbville]] has seen the development of the now older Catidian Place and the much more recent Botany Lane, while bordering Conquerall Bank is hosting the still-growing Meadowbrook Subdivision, arguably the most upscale development in the Bridgewater area although lack of paved roads negates a lot of the positives for the community. The Cookville area also continues to see growth in the Osprey Ridge area. With the exception of Glen Allan, most new residential developments within town limits are the result of urban [[infill]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nBridgewater experiences a [[humid continental climate]], as does most of eastern Canada. The [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]]'s proximity to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] influences the climate to a significant degree, such that the region is usually somewhat milder than most of Canada during the winter months. Nevertheless, winters are generally cold, damp and generally overcast with snowfall occurring often, as well as frequent rain. Summers, while usually less extreme than inland central Canada, are warm to hot and generally quite humid, accented by occasional storms and showers. Autumn and spring are often wildly unpredictable, and snowfall as early as the first week of October is not unheard of.\n\nBecause it lies inland from the ocean, it is usually warmer than coastal Nova Scotia during the summer, and reports far fewer foggy days.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Bridgewater, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1961\u2013present\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  =

While the community is known for its commercial offerings and is generally accepted as being less tourism-driven compared to its municipal neighbours Lunenburg and [[Mahone Bay (town)|Mahone Bay]],\n\nHowever, the town boasts a number of unique cultural events, including the annual Bridgewater Garden Party hosted at the DesBrisay Museum, Christmas on the LaHave, the [http://www.bridgewater.ca/growinggreenfest Growing Green Sustainability Festival], and [http://www.afterglowbridgewater.com/ Afterglow Art Festival].<ref>[http://www.thebigex.com South Shore Exhibition]</ref> The largest annual festival is the [http://www.thebigex.com South Shore Exhibition, which dates to 1891.] The \"Big Ex,\" as it is locally known, is a week-long agricultural fair that is held each July, attracting around 50,000 people. While honoring the area's agricultural heritage, the Big Ex also includes multiple nights of live entertainment on the South Shore Exhibition Grounds.

For many years, the Hospital Chorus and Drama Society (now defunct) helped to raise funds for the Dawson Memorial Hospital (later South Shore Regional Hospital) through its production of Broadway-style musicals.\n\nIn 2014, the [http://artinbridgewater.weebly.com/ Art Happening] was established to create a thriving community art space in Bridgewater. Inspired by the 'Art Hive' movement in Montreal, the group of motivated and enthusiastic community members developed the idea of a free/low cost art building focused on creativity for people of all ages and backgrounds. Today, Art Happening is a not-for-profit organization that strives on fun classes, stress relief, and creativity in all shapes and forms.\n\nLike much of Lunenburg County, many of Bridgewater's residents can trace their lineage back to the Foreign Protestants who arrived in Nova Scotia 18th century. While much of that original culture has been lost, a few remnants remain. Lunenburg pudding, a type of pork sausage, is still widely available, and some residents still speak in an accent unique to the county, dubbed [[Lunenburg English]], featuring one of the few [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] speech patterns remaining in Canada.\n\n== Education and health ==\nThe town is primarily served by Bridgewater Elementary<ref>[http://www.bes.ednet.ns.ca Bridgewater Elementary School]</ref> and [[Bridgewater Junior Senior High School]]s,<ref>[http://bridgewater.ednet.ns.ca Junior/Senior High School]</ref> both located on York Street, near downtown. These aging facilities manage to serve the needs of the town's youth, but lack near-by athletic fields.  [[Park View Education Centre]],<ref>[http://www.pvec.ednet.ns.ca Park View Education Centre]</ref> located at the northern edge of the town, serves grades 10-12 and takes part in the [[International Baccalaureate Organization|International Baccalaureate]] program.  This facility mainly acts as a collector school for students from the rural areas of the county, although some Bridgewater residents do attend as well.  Centre Scolaire de la Rive-Sud, opened in 2010 in Cookville (just outside the town limits) is a French education school, part of Nova Scotia's Acadian school system (CSAP - Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial), offering a primarily French-language education to Francophone families in the area. The Lunenburg campus of the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] is located on High Street, sharing space with the local [[YMCA]]. The town also has two provincial museums, [[DesBrisay Museum|The DesBrisay]] and the [[Wile Carding Mill]], and a central library.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, of the town's population between ages 20\u201364, 24.3% had not received a high school diploma while 56% had received at least some sort of post secondary degree or certificate. Both figures were slightly better than the average for Nova Scotia (25.3% and 54%, respectively), and significantly better than the larger Lunenburg County (30.1% and 50.9%) and neighbouring [[Queens County, Nova Scotia|Queens County]] (37% and 42%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=1206004&Geo2=PR&Code2=12&Data=Count&SearchText=bridgewater&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Education&Custom=|title=2001 Community Profiles|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBridgewater is served by the [[South Shore Regional Hospital]]<ref>{{cite web |title=South Shore Regional Hospital |url=http://www.nshealth.ca/locations-details/South%20Shore%20Regional%20Hospital |publisher=Nova Scotia Health Authority |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> located on Glen Allen Drive. This facility, inaugurated in 1988, replaced the 1960s-era Dawson Memorial Hospital located on the south western side of the town. The SSRH serves as the major hospital in the county and offers most standard services.\n\n== Industry and employment ==\nMost employment in the town is in the commercial and professional service sector, although tire-manufacturer Michelin remains by far the single largest employer. The town's second largest employer is Millennium 1 Solutions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millennium1solutions.com |title=Millennium 1 Solutions}}</ref> a call-centre, and other major employers are South Shore Health, [[Atlantic Superstore]], [[Sobeys]] and [[Walmart]].\n\nIn 2005, the average earnings for all census families was $49,754, more than $4,500 below the provincial average.

CKBW, established in 1947, gave acclaimed actor Donald Sutherland his start in the media at age 14 while he was living in the town. The CKBW News team has received two regional RTNDA Awards and has been a finalist for an Atlantic Journalism Award.  CKBW-FM has shifted its music focus several times over the past two decades, and now airs mostly contemporary pop music. It recently began operating sister-station Hank-FM, which airs country and western style music.

That facility features the Clearwater Seafoods Arena (seating capacity for hockey is 1,200), the BMO Aquatic Centre, and the Margaret Hennigar Public Library.\n\nFollowing the opening of the LCLC, Bridgewater ceased operations at the 65-year-old Bridgewater Memorial Arena in 2015. The Town of Bridgewater also continues to operate an outdoor swimming pool during the summer months on Jubilee Road, located near the DesBrisay Museum.\n\nIn terms of other outdoor facilities, the town is home to the Kinsmen Field (a soccer/football field, baseball diamond), the LaHave baseball/softball/soccer fields on Glen Allen Drive, the Bridgewater Curling Club, and the Bridgewater Tennis Club.\n\nResidents of Bridgewater enjoy a relatively extensive parks system, which the town estimates at {{convert|100|acre|km2}}. This, however, does not include open green space within the town, the inclusion of which would give a much higher total.\n\nThe crown jewel of the parks system continues to be the {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} Woodland Gardens, locally known at the \"Duck Pond.\" This park includes the DesBrisay Museum, one of the town's public swimming pools, a large pond and various trails. Shipyards Landing is a large public park located at the reclaimed site of the former Acadia Gas Engine Company. Situated on south King Street along the LaHave River, the area features berthing for boaters and kayakers, picnic and open space, and is often used as a gathering point for festivals, such as Canada on the LaHave.\n\nOther parks include Pinecrest and Glen Allen, both playgrounds, and Riverview Park, overlooking the rapids of the LaHave River. The system also includes smaller parks, such as King Street Court and Pijinuiskaq Park, located in the heart of the downtown, as well as the eight kilometre [[Trans Canada Trail|Centennial Trail]], which was constructed on abandoned rail lines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bridgewater.ca/ |title=Parks and Trails |publisher=Town of Bridgewater|access-date=23 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2017, the town opened the South Shore Vet Doz Zone (off-leash park) at Generations Active Park, 18 acres of dedicated parkland near HB Studios Sports Centre. The dog park is the first in a multi-year, multi-phase plan to develop the Generations Active Park lands for recreational use by town residents and visitors.\n\n[[File:Bridgewater Cemetery, Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.jpg|1020px|thumb|center|The Bridgewater Cemetery provides a park-like setting for quiet and reflection.]]\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:NSRoute331.png|thumb|180px|Route 331 runs parallel to the LaHave River in Bridgewater.]]The [[LaHave River]] was the main transportation route in historic times, though today it is mainly used for pleasure craft and recreational boating. A cable ferry located in [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave]] is the only crossing downriver from Bridgewater. The [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] once passed through the town but the line is now abandoned. The main road serving the town is [[Nova Scotia Highway 103|Highway 103]], which has two primary exits entering the town. Trunk highways [[Nova Scotia Trunk 10|10]] and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 3|3]] meet at Bridgewater. Other provincial highways are [[Nova Scotia Route 325|Route 325]] and [[Nova Scotia Route 331|Route 331]].\n\nAs the town continues to grow, traffic flow and congestion is of concern. Complicating matters is that Bridgewater draws on a number of satellite communities and, on any given day, Bridgewater's functional population doubles from 8,200 to between 16,000 and 20,000 because of the volume of people from the surrounding areas who come to the town to work, shop, and play. The town's geography and two bridge crossings within town limits also can amplify traffic disruption when construction work forces the temporary closure of one of the main routes.\n\nA public transit pilot for the town began operating in the fall of 2017. The initiative was made permanent in 2019 as the popularity of the service exceeded expectations.<ref>[http://ckbw.ca/news/1065787056/bridgewater-transit-here-stay Bridgewater Transit Is Here to Stay], CKBW Radio, February 26, 2019.

The town's core features a unique combination of traditional, locally owned shops and services on the west bank of the LaHave River (King Street) and a mix of larger, modern box stores on the east bank of the river (LaHave Street).\n\nThe [http://www.bridgewatermall.ca/ Bridgewater Mall], first developed in the 1970s, replaced an old rail yard, and continues to be a strong part of the commercial heart of the town. There was a major renovation of the area in the 1980s, which the addition of Eastside Plaza, and after the Bridgewater Mall properties were sold by Crombie Properties to Zenda Group in 2011, the new owners carried out a $9 million renovation of the mall, in the process bringing a number of new, high-profile tenants, including Sport Chek, and Winners. The Bridgewater Mall also features Sobey's as an anchor tenant at the south end of the site, as well as Cineplex/ and the [[Atlantic Superstore]] are located nearby on the LaHave Street side of downtown.\n\nThe Gateway (Bridgewater) Plaza, located in the southern area of town near the [[Nova Scotia Community College]], continues to thrive despite a changing landscape. While [[Kmart]] closed in the mid-1990s and Canadian Tire relocated to [[Cookville, Nova Scotia|Cookville]] in 2006, the plaza underwent a renovation and is now anchored by discount grocery chain [[No Frills (grocery store)|No Frills]] and [[Giant Tiger]], both of which opened in 2010. The No Frills location was previously a [[Save Easy]] and before that an [[IGA (supermarkets)|IGA]], and has been in continual operation as a grocery store for nearly 50 years despite the name changes.\n\nThe South Shore Mall, located on the eastern edge of town, once home to a movie theatre, grocery and department store, had been completely abandoned by the late 1990s and had been slated for redevelopment as a convention centre, hotel, apartment buildings and shops,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007/021407/news&article=1|title=Former mall property plans unveiled|date=February 14, 2007|publisher=Lighthouse Media Group|archive-date=6 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203924/http://southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2007%2F021407%2Fnews&article=1|access-date=15 June 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> although no progress has occurred on the site as of mid-2019.\n\n== Redevelopment of King Street ==\nIn 2012, Town Council commission a study into the potential redevelopment of King Street as a more community focused center. Released in 2013, the Downtown and Waterfront Master Plan (DWMP) is a 100-plus page document designed to guide the economic and social development of Downtown Bridgewater over the next 20 to 30 years.\n\nThe first phase of implementing the DWMP began in 2015 with the demolition of the South Parkade. The 45-year-old steel and concrete structure was removed and, during 2016, a major infrastructure project was undertaken in the Old Bridge-to-Dufferin block of King Street.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bridgewater.ca/town-services/planning/downtownplan/project-updates |title=Project Updates |access-date=2015-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216222649/http://bridgewater.ca/town-services/planning/downtownplan/project-updates |archive-date=2015-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe project, known as Take Back The Riverbank, included three main components: first, the removal and replacement of existing decades-old water and sewer infrastructure below King Street; second, the reconstruction of the street, including the introduction of better sidewalks, curb bump outs, and street furniture, all designed to make the downtown more pedestrian friendly; and, the construction of Pijinuiskaq Park along the riverbank on the former parkade site. Pijinuiskaq is the historic Mi'kmaq name for the LaHave River.\n\nIn 2016, Bridgewater Town Council agreed to grant $51,000 to allow for the creation of the Bridgewater Facade Improvement Society. The Society oversees a Facade Improvement Program, which invites commercial tenants or property owners in the King Street Architectural Control Area to apply for matching funding of up to $5,000 in matching funding for facade improvement projects.

The [[Bridgewater Police Service]],<ref>[http://www.bridgewaterpolice.ca/ Bridgewater Police Service]</ref> as well as recently relocating to a new, modern facility, has moved towards community based policing, working closely with [[Neighborhood watch|Neighbourhood Watch]] programs and local schools, as well as adding foot and bicycle patrols in areas that squad cars are unable to reach.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bridgewater.ca/crime-prevention/community-policing.html |title=Community Policing |access-date=2008-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108030314/http://www.bridgewater.ca/crime-prevention/community-policing.html |archive-date=2008-01-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Bridgewater Police Service is governed by the Bridgewater Police Commission.

Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography.

Delchev had a number of meetings with [[Danail Nikolaev]], [[Yosif Kovachev]], [[Toma Karayovov]], [[Andrey Lyapchev]] and others, but he was often frustrated of their views.

Then the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee organized a failed uprising in [[Pirin Macedonia]] ([[Gorna Dzhumaya]]), which merely served to provoke Ottoman repressions and hampered the work of the underground network of SMARO.\n\nThe primary question regarding the timing of the uprising in Macedonia and Thrace implicated an apparent discordance not only among the SMAC and the SMARO, but also among the SMARO's leadership. At the Thessaloniki Congress of January 1903, where Delchev did not participate, an early uprising was debated and it was decided to stage one in the Spring of 1903. This led to fierce debates among the representatives at the Sofia SMARO's Conference in March 1903. By that time two strong tendencies had crystallized within the SMARO. The right-wing majority was convinced that if the Organization would unleash a ''general uprising'',  Bulgaria would be provoked to declare war of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and after the subsequent intervention of the [[Great Powers]] the [[Ottoman Empire|Empire]] would collapse.<ref>Socialism and nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, 1876\u20131923, Mete Tun\u00e7ay, Erik Jan Z\u00fcrcher, British Academic Press, Amsterdam, 1994, {{ISBN|1850437874}}, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe left-wing faction led by Delchev, on the other hand, warned against the risks of such unrealistic plans, opposing the uprising as inappropriate as tactics and premature by time.<ref>\u041f\u0435\u0439\u043e \u042f\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \"\u0421\u044a\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\", \u0422\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438, \"\u0413\u043e\u0446\u0435 \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0447\u0435\u0432\", \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\", \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 1977, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 62\u201366. {{in lang|bg}} In English: Peyo Yavorov, \"Complete Works\", Volume 2, biography '' Delchev'', Publishing house \"Bulgarian writer\", Sofia, 1977, pp. 62\u201366.\n</ref> Deltchev, who was under the influence of the leading Bulgarian anarchists as [[Mihail Gerdzhikov]] and [[Varban Kilifarski]] personally supported the tactics of ''[[Anarchist terrorism|terrorist attacks]]'' as the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRm-aY6_RBIC&pg=PA54\n|title=Das makedonische Jahrhundert: von den Anf\u00e4ngen der nationalrevolution\u00e4ren Bewegung zum Abkommen von Ohrid 1893\u20132001 ; ausgew\u00e4hlte Aufs\u00e4tze, Stefan Troebst, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, s. 54\u201357 \n|publisher=Google Books\n|isbn=3486580507\n|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}\n</ref> Finally, he had no choice but agree to that course of action at least managing to delay its start from May to August. Delchev also convinced the SMARO leadership to transform its idea of a mass rising involving the civil population into a rising based on [[guerrilla warfare]]. Towards the end of March 1903 Gotse with his detachment destroyed the railway bridge over the [[Aggitis|Angista]] river, aiming to test the new guerrilla tactics. Following that he set out for Thessaloniki to meet with [[Dame Gruev]] after his release from prison in March 1903. Dame Gruev met with Delchev in the late April and they discussed the decision of starting the uprising. Afterwards they negotiated with some of the Thessaloniki bombers to ask them to give up the attacks as dangerous to the liberation movement, or at least to wait for the impending uprising.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.krumblagov.com/fifty/2.php \n|title=50-\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f. \u041a\u0440\u0443\u043c \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, # 2. \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \n|publisher=Krumblagov.com \n|accessdate=November 20, 2011 \n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504095638/http://krumblagov.com/fifty/2.php \n|archive-date=May 4, 2015 \n|url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Subsequently, Delchev met also with [[Ivan Garvanov]], who was at that time the leader of the SMARO.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.exartonline.com/sitebulgari/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=338:2011-09-21-16-11-58&catid=29:2010-04-24-09-14-13&Itemid=61\n |title      = \u0413\u043e\u0446\u0435 \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0447\u0435\u0432, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u044a\u0442 \u0441 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0441\u0430, \u0426\u043e\u0447\u043e \u0411\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\n |publisher  = Exartonline.com\n |accessdate = November 20, 2011\n}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref> After this meetings Delchev headed for Mount [[Slavyanka (mountain)|Ali Botush]] where he was expected to meet with representatives from the [[Serres]] Revolutionary District detachments and to check their military preparation.

IMRO treated suspiciously to the Bulgarians, which participated in other churches, as the Greek Patriarchate, the Eastern Catholic Church and the Protestant Church. As to the revolutionary activity among the other nationalities as Greeks, Turks, Albanians and Vlachs, such question did not exist for the founders of the organization. This other nationalities were for IMRO foreign people... Later, when the leaders of IMRO saw, that the idea for liberation of Macedonia can find followers among the Bulgarians non-Exarchists, as also among the other nationalities in Macedonia, and under the pressure from IMRO-members with left, socialist or anarchist convictions, they changed the statute of IMRO in sense, that member of IMRO can be any Macedonian and Adrianopolitan, regardless from his ethnicity or religious denomination...''

That is why the peoples of these two regions had to win their own freedom, within the frontiers of an autonomous Macedonian-Adrianople state.<ref>In a conversation in 1900, with Lozengrad comrades, he was asked whether, in the event of a rising, the Organization should count on help from the Bulgarian Principality, and whether it would not be wiser at the outset to proclaim the union of Macedonia and Thrace with the Principality. Gotse replied: \"We have to work courageously, organizing and arming ourselves well enough to take the burden of the struggle upon our own shoulders, without counting on outside help. External intervention is not desirable from the point of view of our cause. Our aim, our ideal is autonomy for Macedonia and the Adrianople region, and we must also bring into the struggle the other peoples who live in these two provinces as well...

In 2016 its name was changed to [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]], who led the [[Belgrade operation]] at the end of the Second World War.

As it became more powerful, IMRO was able to impress upon the Exarchate its wishes for teacher and inspector appointments in Macedonia.''

Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

IMRO was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between \u2018Macedonians\u2019 and \u2018Bulgarians\u2019.

Meanwhile, most emphasis was placed on celebrating the joint Yugoslav history of the World War II Communist struggle.

Then the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee organized a failed uprising in [[Pirin Macedonia]] ([[Gorna Dzhumaya]]), which merely served to provoke Ottoman repressions and hampered the work of the underground network of SMARO.\n\nThe primary question regarding the timing of the uprising in Macedonia and Thrace implicated an apparent discordance not only among the SMAC and the SMARO, but also among the SMARO's leadership. At the Thessaloniki Congress of January 1903, where Delchev did not participate, an early uprising was debated and it was decided to stage one in the Spring of 1903. This led to fierce debates among the representatives at the Sofia SMARO's Conference in March 1903. By that time two strong tendencies had crystallized within the SMARO. The right-wing majority was convinced that if the Organization would unleash a ''general uprising'',  Bulgaria would be provoked to declare war of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and after the subsequent intervention of the [[Great Powers]] the [[Ottoman Empire|Empire]] would collapse.<ref>Socialism and nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, 1876\u20131923, Mete Tun\u00e7ay, Erik Jan Z\u00fcrcher, British Academic Press, Amsterdam, 1994, {{ISBN|1850437874}}, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe left-wing faction led by Delchev, on the other hand, warned against the risks of such unrealistic plans, opposing the uprising as inappropriate as tactics and premature by time.<ref>\u041f\u0435\u0439\u043e \u042f\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \"\u0421\u044a\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\", \u0422\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438, \"\u0413\u043e\u0446\u0435 \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0447\u0435\u0432\", \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\", \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 1977, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 62\u201366. {{in lang|bg}} In English: Peyo Yavorov, \"Complete Works\", Volume 2, biography '' Delchev'', Publishing house \"Bulgarian writer\", Sofia, 1977, pp. 62\u201366.\n</ref> Deltchev, who was under the influence of the leading Bulgarian anarchists as [[Mihail Gerdzhikov]] and [[Varban Kilifarski]] personally supported the tactics of ''[[Anarchist terrorism|terrorist attacks]]'' as the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRm-aY6_RBIC&pg=PA54\n|title=Das makedonische Jahrhundert: von den Anf\u00e4ngen der nationalrevolution\u00e4ren Bewegung zum Abkommen von Ohrid 1893\u20132001 ; ausgew\u00e4hlte Aufs\u00e4tze, Stefan Troebst, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, s. 54\u201357 \n|publisher=Google Books\n|isbn=3486580507\n|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}\n</ref> Finally, he had no choice but agree to that course of action at least managing to delay its start from May to August. Delchev also convinced the SMARO leadership to transform its idea of a mass rising involving the civil population into a rising based on [[guerrilla warfare]]. Towards the end of March 1903 Gotse with his detachment destroyed the railway bridge over the [[Aggitis|Angista]] river, aiming to test the new guerrilla tactics.

That is why the peoples of these two regions had to win their own freedom, within the frontiers of an autonomous Macedonian-Adrianople state.<ref>In a conversation in 1900, with Lozengrad comrades, he was asked whether, in the event of a rising, the Organization should count on help from the Bulgarian Principality, and whether it would not be wiser at the outset to proclaim the union of Macedonia and Thrace with the Principality. Gotse replied: \"We have to work courageously, organizing and arming ourselves well enough to take the burden of the struggle upon our own shoulders, without counting on outside help. External intervention is not desirable from the point of view of our cause. Our aim, our ideal is autonomy for Macedonia and the Adrianople region, and we must also bring into the struggle the other peoples who live in these two provinces as well...

In 2016 its name was changed to [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]], who led the [[Belgrade operation]] at the end of the Second World War.

'''Jama'at''', was a militant [[Jihadism|Jihadist]]<ref name=winepJune14/> group. It was founded in Jordan in 1999 and was led by [[Jordan]]ian national [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] for the entirety of its existence. During the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)]], the group became a decentralized network with foreign fighters<ref name=ChristianScienceMonitor20040514/> and a considerable Iraqi membership.<ref name=Bbc20060815/>\n\nOn 17 October 2004, al-Zarqawi pledged [[Bay'ah|allegiance]] to [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[al-Qaeda]] network, and the group became known as [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn]] (commonly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq<ref name=JamestownFoundation20041018/><ref name=JamestownFoundation20041216GordonCorera/> or Tanzim). After several mergers with other groups, it changed its name several times until it called itself [[Islamic State of Iraq]] (ISI) in 2006.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] was a Jordanian [[Jihadism|Jihadist]] who traveled to [[Afghanistan]] to fight in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], but arrived after the departure of the Soviet troops and soon returned to his homeland.
