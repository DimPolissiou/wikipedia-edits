They made little progress at first, because \"[[blackbirding]]\" (the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the [[sugar plantation]]s in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]]) led to [[List of massacres in the Solomon Islands|a series of reprisals and massacres]]. The evils of the slave trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in June 1893.<ref>[http://motherearthtravel.com/solomon_islands/history.htm \"History of the Solomon Islands\".] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1898 and 1899, more outlying islands were added to the protectorate; in 1900 the remainder of the archipelago, [[North Solomon Islands|an area previously under German jurisdiction]], was transferred to British administration, apart from the islands of [[Buka Island|Buka]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], which remained under German administration as part of [[German New Guinea]]. Traditional trade and social intercourse between the western Solomon Islands of Mono and Alu (the Shortlands) and the traditional societies in the south of Bougainville, however, continued without hindrance.\n\nMissionaries settled in the Solomons under the protectorate, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century several British and Australian firms began large-scale coconut planting. Economic growth was slow, however, and the islanders benefited little.\n\nJournalist [[Joe Melvin]] visited in 1892, as part of his undercover investigation into blackbirding. In 1908 the islands were visited by [[Jack London]], who was cruising the Pacific on his boat, the ''Snark''.\n\n===Second World War===\n\nThe Solomon Islands were one of the major staging areas of the South Pacific and was home to the famous [[VMA-214|VMF-214 \"Black Sheep\" Squadron]] commanded by [[Pappy Boyington|Major Greg \"Pappy\" Boyington]]. \"The Slot\" was a name for [[New Georgia Sound]], when it was used by the [[Tokyo Express]] to supply the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal.

Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons. The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[Japanese Imperial]] Forces was launched on 7 August 1942, with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mylescfoxdd829.net/TulagiBattle.htm|title=The Tulagi Battle|publisher=Mylescfoxdd829.net|date=7 August 1942|accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]].\n\nThe [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse the Japanese expansion.

A new constitution was established in 1970 and elections were held, although the constitution was contested and a new one was created in 1974. In 1973 the first oil price shock occurred, and the increased cost of running a colony became apparent to British administrators.\n\nFollowing the independence of neighbouring [[Papua New Guinea]] from Australia in 1975, the Solomon Islands gained self-government in 1976. Independence was granted on 7 July 1978. The first Prime Minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]], and Solomon Islands retained the monarchy.\n\nIn September 2012, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess]] of Cambridge visited the islands to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{cite news |last1=English |first1=Rebecca |title=Carnival Kate met by crowd of 70,000 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203983/Kate-Middleton-met-crowd-70-000-William-parade-streets-canoe-float.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |date=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:I was present for the Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978.jpg|The Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977\n</gallery>\n\n===Ethnic violence (1998\u20132003)===\nCommonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, Kabutaulaka (2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/melanesia/working_papers/tarcisiusworkingpaper.htm |title=Cap \u2013 Anu |publisher=Rspas.anu.edu.au |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.)\n\nIn late 1998, militants on the island of Guadalcanal began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. During the next year, thousands of Malaitans fled back to Malaita or to the capital, Honiara (which, although situated on Guadalcanal, is predominantly populated by Malaitans and Solomon Islanders from other provinces). In 1999, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established in response.\n\nThe reformist government of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict. In late 1999, the government declared a four-month state of emergency. There were also a number of attempts at reconciliation but to no avail. Ulufa'alu also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand in 1999 but his appeal was rejected.\n\nIn the [[2000 Solomon Islands coup d'etat|June 2000 coup d'\u00e9tat]], Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by militia members of the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as Prime Minister by 23\u201321 over the Rev. [[Leslie Boseto]]. However, Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote (Moore 2004, n.5 on p.&nbsp;174).\n\nIn October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |title=THE TOWNSVILLE PEACE AGREEMENT |date=15 October 2000 |website=Commerce.gov.sb |accessdate=9 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210034717/http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |archivedate=10 February 2011 }}</ref> was signed by the Malaita Eagle Force, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.\n\nNew elections in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast while militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. Renegade members of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented.\n\nThe prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help. With the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos, the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.\n\nIn July 2003, Australian and Pacific Island police and troops arrived in Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia and New Zealand, and with representatives from about 20 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under [[Operation Helpem Fren]]. Since this time some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031110092412/http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2003|title=Pacific Islands: PINA and Pacific|date=10 November 2003}}</ref> However, other academics argue that rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence.<ref>Pillars and Shadows: Statebuilding as Peacebuilding in Solomon Islands, J. Braithwaite, S. Dinnen, M.Allen, V. Braithwaite & H. Charlesworth, Canberra, ANU E Press: 2010.</ref>\n\nIn April 2006, allegations that the newly elected Prime Minister [[Snyder Rini]] had used bribes from Chinese businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital [[Honiara]]. A deep underlying resentment against the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.<ref name=BBC/> Tensions were also increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to China. China sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of Chinese who fled to avoid the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale.

(10708895683).jpg|thumb|Solomon Islands' National Parliament building was a gift from the United States.]]\n[[File:Honiara Ministry of the Interior.jpg|thumb|Ministry of the Interior]]\n\nSolomon Islands is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and has a [[parliamentary system]] of government. As [[Queen of Solomon Islands]], [[Elizabeth II]] is [[head of state]]; she is represented by the [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Parliament for a five-year term. There is a [[unicameral]] parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by majority vote of its members before the completion of its term.\n\nParliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html|title=CIA \u2013 The World Factbook \u2013 Solomon Islands|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]], who is elected by Parliament and chooses the [[Cabinet of Solomon Islands|cabinet]]. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a [[permanent secretary]], a career public servant who directs the staff of the ministry.\n\nSolomon Islands governments are characterised by weak political parties (see [[List of political parties in Solomon Islands]]) and highly unstable parliamentary coalitions. They are subject to frequent [[votes of no confidence]], leading to frequent changes in government leadership and cabinet appointments.\n\nLand ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and [[Kiribati]], may obtain citizenship through naturalisation. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.\n\nNo military forces are maintained by Solomon Islands although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police also are responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands Government took steps to prevent the country's Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament,<ref>Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, \u2013 [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 \"Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion\"], \u2013 ''Solomon Times'', \u2013 13 December 2007</ref> following the defection of five ministers to the opposition.

The various paramilitary elements of the [[Royal Solomon Islands Police Force]] (RSIPF) were disbanded and disarmed in 2003 following the intervention of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] ([[RAMSI]]). RAMSI has a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIPF still operates two [[Pacific class patrol boat]]s (RSIPV ''Auki'' and RSIPV ''Lata''), which constitute the de facto navy of Solomon Islands.\n\nIn the long term, it is anticipated that the RSIPF will resume the defence role of the country. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the [[governor general]] and responsible to the Minister of Police, National Security & Correctional Services.\n\nThe police budget of Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year civil war. Following [[Cyclone Zoe]]'s strike on the islands of [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with 200,000 Solomon dollars ($50,000 Australian) for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat ''Lata'' to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of RAMSI includes assisting the Solomon Islands government to stabilise its budget.)\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Provinces of Solomon Islands}}\n\nFor local government, the country is divided into ten administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies and the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! # || Province !!

The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;mi). The Santa Cruz Islands (of which Tikopia is part) are situated north of [[Vanuatu]] and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi) from the other islands. [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] is geographically part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but politically part of Papua New Guinea.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of {{convert|26.5|C|F}} and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about {{convert|3050|mm|in}}.\n\n=== Ecology ===\nThe Solomon Islands [[archipelago]] is part of two distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. Most of the islands are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] ecoregion, which also includes the islands of Bougainville and Buka; these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The Santa Cruz Islands are part of the [[Vanuatu rain forests]] ecoregion, together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are [[volcano]]es with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape. Mammals are scarce on the islands, with the only terrestrial mammals being bats and small rodents. Birds and reptiles, however, are abundant.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes.

Minerals exploration in other areas continued.The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, [[zinc]], nickel, and gold. Negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine which was closed after the riots in 2006.\n\n'''Fisheries'''\n\nSolomon Islands' fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed.\n\n'''Tourism'''\n\nTourism, particularly diving, could become an important service industry for Solomon Islands. Tourism growth, however, is hampered by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations. In 2017 the Solomon Islands were visited by 26,000 tourists making the country one of the least frequently-visited countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keine Lust auf Massentourismus?

Its symbol is \"SI$\", but the \"SI\" prefix may be omitted if there is no confusion with other currencies also using the [[dollar sign]] \"$\". It is subdivided into 100 [[Cent (currency)|cents]]. Local [[shell money]] is still important for traditional and ceremonial purposes in certain provinces and, in some remote parts of the country, for trade. Shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the Pacific Islands, in Solomon Islands, it is mostly manufactured in [[Malaita]] and [[Guadalcanal]] but can be bought elsewhere, such as the [[Honiara Central Market]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/currency-as-cultural-craft-shell-money/|title=Currency as Cultural Craft: Shell Money \u2013 The Official Globe Trekker Website|work=The Official Globe Trekker Website|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref> The [[barter]] system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas.\nThe Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget. It has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with Australian backing, is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n===Energy===\nA team of renewable energy developers working for the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) and funded by the [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership]] (REEEP), have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, water and wind power, without the need to raise substantial sums of cash. Under the scheme, islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/solomon-islands-solar-a-new-microfinance-concept-takes-root Solomon Islands Solar: A New Microfinance Concept Takes Root].

For example, women who believed they could occasionally refuse sex were four times more likely to experience GBV from an intimate partner. Men cited acceptability of violence and gender inequality as two main reasons for GBV, and almost all of them reported hitting their female partners as a 'form of discipline,' suggesting that women could improve the situation by '[learning] to obey [them].'\"\n\nAnother manifestation and driver of gender inequality in Solomon Islands is the traditional practice of [[Bride price#Solomon Islands|bride price]]. Although specific customs vary between communities, paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title, giving men ownership over women. Gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to \"control\" their wives, often through violence, while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men.

They made little progress at first, because \"[[blackbirding]]\" (the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the [[sugar plantation]]s in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]]) led to [[List of massacres in the Solomon Islands|a series of reprisals and massacres]]. The evils of the slave trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in June 1893.<ref>[http://motherearthtravel.com/solomon_islands/history.htm \"History of the Solomon Islands\".] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1898 and 1899, more outlying islands were added to the protectorate; in 1900 the remainder of the archipelago, [[North Solomon Islands|an area previously under German jurisdiction]], was transferred to British administration, apart from the islands of [[Buka Island|Buka]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], which remained under German administration as part of [[German New Guinea]]. Traditional trade and social intercourse between the western Solomon Islands of Mono and Alu (the Shortlands) and the traditional societies in the south of Bougainville, however, continued without hindrance.\n\nMissionaries settled in the Solomons under the protectorate, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century several British and Australian firms began large-scale coconut planting. Economic growth was slow, however, and the islanders benefited little.\n\nJournalist [[Joe Melvin]] visited in 1892, as part of his undercover investigation into blackbirding. In 1908 the islands were visited by [[Jack London]], who was cruising the Pacific on his boat, the ''Snark''.\n\n===Second World War===\n\nThe Solomon Islands were one of the major staging areas of the South Pacific and was home to the famous [[VMA-214|VMF-214 \"Black Sheep\" Squadron]] commanded by [[Pappy Boyington|Major Greg \"Pappy\" Boyington]]. \"The Slot\" was a name for [[New Georgia Sound]], when it was used by the [[Tokyo Express]] to supply the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal.

Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons.

A new constitution was established in 1970 and elections were held, although the constitution was contested and a new one was created in 1974. In 1973 the first oil price shock occurred, and the increased cost of running a colony became apparent to British administrators.\n\nFollowing the independence of neighbouring [[Papua New Guinea]] from Australia in 1975, the Solomon Islands gained self-government in 1976. Independence was granted on 7 July 1978. The first Prime Minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]], and Solomon Islands retained the monarchy.\n\nIn September 2012, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess]] of Cambridge visited the islands to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{cite news |last1=English |first1=Rebecca |title=Carnival Kate met by crowd of 70,000 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203983/Kate-Middleton-met-crowd-70-000-William-parade-streets-canoe-float.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |date=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:I was present for the Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978.jpg|The Solomon Islands Independence Ceremony on 7 July 1978\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin\nFile:The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977.jpg|The Five Dollar Proof Coin of the Solomon Islands 24 October 1977\n</gallery>\n\n===Ethnic violence (1998\u20132003)===\nCommonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, Kabutaulaka (2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/melanesia/working_papers/tarcisiusworkingpaper.htm |title=Cap \u2013 Anu |publisher=Rspas.anu.edu.au |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.)\n\nIn late 1998, militants on the island of Guadalcanal began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. During the next year, thousands of Malaitans fled back to Malaita or to the capital, Honiara (which, although situated on Guadalcanal, is predominantly populated by Malaitans and Solomon Islanders from other provinces). In 1999, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established in response.\n\nThe reformist government of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict. In late 1999, the government declared a four-month state of emergency. There were also a number of attempts at reconciliation but to no avail. Ulufa'alu also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand in 1999 but his appeal was rejected.\n\nIn the [[2000 Solomon Islands coup d'etat|June 2000 coup d'\u00e9tat]], Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by militia members of the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as Prime Minister by 23\u201321 over the Rev. [[Leslie Boseto]]. However, Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote (Moore 2004, n.5 on p.&nbsp;174).\n\nIn October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |title=THE TOWNSVILLE PEACE AGREEMENT |date=15 October 2000 |website=Commerce.gov.sb |accessdate=9 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210034717/http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |archivedate=10 February 2011 }}</ref> was signed by the Malaita Eagle Force, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.\n\nNew elections in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast while militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. Renegade members of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented.\n\nThe prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help. With the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos, the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.\n\nIn July 2003, Australian and Pacific Island police and troops arrived in Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia and New Zealand, and with representatives from about 20 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under [[Operation Helpem Fren]]. Since this time some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031110092412/http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2003|title=Pacific Islands: PINA and Pacific|date=10 November 2003}}</ref> However, other academics argue that rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence.<ref>Pillars and Shadows: Statebuilding as Peacebuilding in Solomon Islands, J.

A deep underlying resentment against the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.<ref name=BBC/> Tensions were also increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to China. China sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of Chinese who fled to avoid the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional Australian, New Zealand and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as Prime Minister.\n\n===Earthquakes===\n{{main|2007 Solomon Islands earthquake|2013 Solomon Islands earthquake}}\nOn 2 April 2007 at 07:39:56 local time ([[UTC+11]]) an earthquake with magnitude 8.1 occurred at hypocenter S8.453 E156.957, 349 kilometres (217 miles) northwest of the island's capital, [[Honiara]] and south-east of the capital of [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]], [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]], at a depth of 10&nbsp;km (6.2&nbsp;miles).<ref>[http://www.breakinglegalnews.com/entry/Solomon-Islands-earthquake-and-tsunami \"Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami\"], Breaking Legal News \u2013 International, 4 March 2007</ref> More than 44 aftershocks with magnitude 5.0 or greater occurred up until 22:00:00 UTC, Wednesday, 4 April 2007.

(10708895683).jpg|thumb|Solomon Islands' National Parliament building was a gift from the United States.]]\n[[File:Honiara Ministry of the Interior.jpg|thumb|Ministry of the Interior]]\n\nSolomon Islands is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and has a [[parliamentary system]] of government. As [[Queen of Solomon Islands]], [[Elizabeth II]] is [[head of state]]; she is represented by the [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Parliament for a five-year term. There is a [[unicameral]] parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by majority vote of its members before the completion of its term.\n\nParliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html|title=CIA \u2013 The World Factbook \u2013 Solomon Islands|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]], who is elected by Parliament and chooses the [[Cabinet of Solomon Islands|cabinet]]. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a [[permanent secretary]], a career public servant who directs the staff of the ministry.\n\nSolomon Islands governments are characterised by weak political parties (see [[List of political parties in Solomon Islands]]) and highly unstable parliamentary coalitions. They are subject to frequent [[votes of no confidence]], leading to frequent changes in government leadership and cabinet appointments.\n\nLand ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and [[Kiribati]], may obtain citizenship through naturalisation. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.\n\nNo military forces are maintained by Solomon Islands although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police also are responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands Government took steps to prevent the country's Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament,<ref>Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, \u2013 [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 \"Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion\"], \u2013 ''Solomon Times'', \u2013 13 December 2007</ref> following the defection of five ministers to the opposition. It was the first time a prime minister had lost office in this way in Solomon Islands.

The various paramilitary elements of the [[Royal Solomon Islands Police Force]] (RSIPF) were disbanded and disarmed in 2003 following the intervention of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] ([[RAMSI]]). RAMSI has a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIPF still operates two [[Pacific class patrol boat]]s (RSIPV ''Auki'' and RSIPV ''Lata''), which constitute the de facto navy of Solomon Islands.\n\nIn the long term, it is anticipated that the RSIPF will resume the defence role of the country. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the [[governor general]] and responsible to the Minister of Police, National Security & Correctional Services.\n\nThe police budget of Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year civil war. Following [[Cyclone Zoe]]'s strike on the islands of [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with 200,000 Solomon dollars ($50,000 Australian) for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat ''Lata'' to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of RAMSI includes assisting the Solomon Islands government to stabilise its budget.)\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Provinces of Solomon Islands}}\n\nFor local government, the country is divided into ten administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies and the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! # || Province !!

(10702263414).jpg|thumb|[[Malaita]] island]]\n\nSolomon Islands is an island nation that lies east of Papua New Guinea and consists of many islands: [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], the [[Shortland Islands]]; the [[New Georgia Islands]]; [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]]; the [[Russell Islands]]; [[Nggela]] (the [[Florida Islands]]); [[Malaita]]; [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]]; [[Sikaiana]]; [[Maramasike]]; [[Ulawa]]; [[Uki Island|Uki]]; [[Makira]] ([[San Cristobal (Solomon Islands)|San Cristobal]]); [[Santa Ana (Solomon Islands)|Santa Ana]]; [[Rennell and Bellona]]; the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] and the remote, tiny outliers, [[Tikopia]], [[Anuta]], and [[Fatutaka]].\n\nThe country's islands lie between latitudes [[5th parallel south|5\u00b0]] and [[13th parallel south|13\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[155th meridian east|155\u00b0]] and [[169th meridian east|169\u00b0E]]. The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;mi). The Santa Cruz Islands (of which Tikopia is part) are situated north of [[Vanuatu]] and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi) from the other islands. [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] is geographically part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but politically part of Papua New Guinea.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of {{convert|26.5|C|F}} and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about {{convert|3050|mm|in}}.\n\n=== Ecology ===\nThe Solomon Islands [[archipelago]] is part of two distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. Most of the islands are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] ecoregion, which also includes the islands of Bougainville and Buka; these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The Santa Cruz Islands are part of the [[Vanuatu rain forests]] ecoregion, together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are [[volcano]]es with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape. Mammals are scarce on the islands, with the only terrestrial mammals being bats and small rodents. Birds and reptiles, however, are abundant.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes.

Negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine which was closed after the riots in 2006.\n\n'''Fisheries'''\n\nSolomon Islands' fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed.\n\n'''Tourism'''\n\nTourism, particularly diving, could become an important service industry for Solomon Islands. Tourism growth, however, is hampered by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations. In 2017 the Solomon Islands were visited by 26,000 tourists making the country one of the least frequently-visited countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keine Lust auf Massentourismus?

Local [[shell money]] is still important for traditional and ceremonial purposes in certain provinces and, in some remote parts of the country, for trade. Shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the Pacific Islands, in Solomon Islands, it is mostly manufactured in [[Malaita]] and [[Guadalcanal]] but can be bought elsewhere, such as the [[Honiara Central Market]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/currency-as-cultural-craft-shell-money/|title=Currency as Cultural Craft: Shell Money \u2013 The Official Globe Trekker Website|work=The Official Globe Trekker Website|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref> The [[barter]] system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas.\nThe Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget. It has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with Australian backing, is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n===Energy===\nA team of renewable energy developers working for the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) and funded by the [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership]] (REEEP), have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, water and wind power, without the need to raise substantial sums of cash. Under the scheme, islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/solomon-islands-solar-a-new-microfinance-concept-takes-root Solomon Islands Solar: A New Microfinance Concept Takes Root].

For example, women who believed they could occasionally refuse sex were four times more likely to experience GBV from an intimate partner. Men cited acceptability of violence and gender inequality as two main reasons for GBV, and almost all of them reported hitting their female partners as a 'form of discipline,' suggesting that women could improve the situation by '[learning] to obey [them].'\"\n\nAnother manifestation and driver of gender inequality in Solomon Islands is the traditional practice of [[Bride price#Solomon Islands|bride price]]. Although specific customs vary between communities, paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title, giving men ownership over women. Gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to \"control\" their wives, often through violence, while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men.
