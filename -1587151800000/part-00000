Burns]]) has inherited Herbie from his uncle Jim Douglas and travels to [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Mexico]] with his friend Davy \"D.J.\" Johns ([[Charles Martin Smith]]) to retrieve the car. There, they befriend Paco ([[Joaquin Garay III]]), a comically mischievous, orphaned pickpocket.\n\nPete and D.J. board the ''Sun Princess'', a cruise ship, to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Pr\u00eamio, while Paco follows hidden in Herbie's cargo compartment. ''En route'' they meet an anthropology student named Melissa ([[Elyssa Davalos]]) and her extravagant, eccentric aunt Louise ([[Cloris Leachman]]), who is trying to find a husband for her niece. When Herbie wreaks havoc on board, Pete pretends to court Melissa, intending that her Aunt Louise will sponsor their race.\n\nMeanwhile, Herbie helps Paco, who has dubbed the car 'Ocho', escape captivity. When the ship's Captain Blythe ([[Harvey Korman]]) has his costume party wrecked by the boy and car, he has Herbie dropped into the sea. However, later on land, a rusty Herbie resurfaces from the water to reunite with Paco, who then goes into business with Herbie as a [[taxicab|taxi]].\n\nThereafter follow three [[villain]]s ([[John Vernon]], [[Alex Rocco]], and [[Richard Jaeckel]]) seeking to capture an antique gold disc, and to find Paco as earlier he had pickpocketed their wallets which contained important film by threatening to use an acetylene torch to cut up Herbie; Herbie's matador part in a bullfight; [[Romantic friendship|romance]] between Aunt Louise and Captain Blythe; and bananas initially used to conceal Herbie among farm vehicles traveling to market and later used by Herbie and Paco to stop the villains escaping justice by having them trip over bananas and Herbie wrecking their airplane to prevent them from getting away. The villains are captured by the police, and the protagonists re-unite on the Sun Princess. Pete and Davy resume their plans to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Pr\u00eamio with Paco dressed as the driver (Pete concedes that Paco and Herbie have a better connection than Pete would have if he drove Herbie in the race). Davy finally asks Paco why he keeps referring to Herbie as \"Ocho\", since that is Spanish for eight. Paco looks at Herbie's \"53\" and remarks that 5+3=8.  After that Pete, Davy, Aunt Louise, and Melissa have a toast hoping for Herbie to win the race with Paco giving Herbie a thumbs up.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Aunt Louise Trends\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Davy \"D.J.\" Johns\n* [[John Vernon]] as Prindle\n* [[Stephan W.

In November 1941, officers arrived at the Logue family home to arrest Sue Logue and her brother-in-law for their hiring of the hit man who murdered Davis Timmerman. George Louge and Fred Dorn ambushed the officers after they were allowed entry into the home, the sheriff and deputy both being fatally wounded by the duo. Thurmond, who learned of the shooting while attending a morning church service, became concerned of further violence and drove to the home. On arriving, he removed his jacket and vest while turning his pockets inside out to show that he was without a weapon, then walked inside the home and confronted a Logue family friend who had aimed a shotgun at him. Thurmond persuaded Sue Logue to surrender with the promise that he would secure her safe passage through the hostile crowd that had assembled outside following the murders of the officers. His act was the subject of a multitude of stories in South Carolina newspapers for the following days.

After Thurmond missed a party meeting in December of that year in which the States' Rights Democratic Party announced the creation of a state's rights institute in Washington, columnist John Temples Graves, disappointed in Thurmond's absence, opined that his campaign had been the best argument that the States' Rights Democratic Party was a national movement centered around the future of liberty and restrained government. Thurmond concurrently received counsel from Walter Brown and Robert Figgs to break from the party and seek reclaiming credentials that would validate him in the minds of others as a liberal. Biographer Joseph Crespino observed that Thurmond was aware that he could neither completely abandon the Democratic Party as it embraced the civil rights initiative of the Truman administration nor let go of his supporters within the States' Rights Democratic Party, who he courted for support in his 1950 campaign for the Senate.<ref>{{cite book|title=Strom Thurmond's America|first=Joseph|last=Crespino|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/85 85\u201386.]|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=978-0809094806|url=https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/85}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently with Thurmond's discontent, former Senator and Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]] began speaking out against the Truman administration's domestic policies. Throughout 1949, Thurmond delivered addresses similar to that of Byrne's earlier in the year, asserting that the United States was inching closer to socialism and the welfare state as they lost their local sovereignty under the Truman administration. Walter Brown sought to link the 1950 gubernatorial campaign of Byrnes with the Thurmond Senate campaign as part of a collective effort against President Truman. Within a day of each other, as Byrnes delivered remarks opposing Truman and Thurmond was elected Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference, the effort by Brown appeared to have been a success. Byrnes indirectly criticized Thurmond when asked by a reporter in 1950 about his governing if elected South Carolina Governor, saying he would not waste time \"appointing colonels and crowning queens\", the remark geared toward the image of Thurmond as not serious and conniving. Brown wrote to Thurmond that the comment was a death to any potential alliance between the two South Carolina politicians and Thurmond and his wife are described as looking \"like they had been shot\" when reading the Byrnes quotation in the newspaper.<ref>{{cite book|title=Strom Thurmond's America|first=Joseph|last=Crespino|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/87 87\u201388.]|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=978-0809094806|url=https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/87}}</ref>\n\n===Early runs for Senate===\nAccording to the state constitution, Thurmond was barred from seeking a succeeding second term as governor in 1950, so he mounted a Democratic primary challenge against first-term U.S. Senator [[Olin Johnston]]. By February 1950, reporter Eleanor Nance had distributed a story saying Washington political circles had concluded Thurmond would not mount a senatorial bid, but the report remained unpublished due to convictions within South Carolina that Thurmond was a candidate without having announced that he was.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19500213&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Thurmond Not Candidate?|date=February 13, 1950|publisher=Herald-Journal}}</ref> On May 1, Thurmond's Senate campaign headquarters opened in Columbia, South Carolina with Ernest Craig serving as campaign leader and George McNabb in charge of public relations while both were on leave from their state positions in the governor's office.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19500502&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Thurmond Opens Campaign Center|date=May 2, 1950|publisher=Herald-Journal}}</ref> In the one-party state of the time, the Democratic primary was the only competitive contest. Both candidates denounced President Truman during the campaign. Johnston defeated Thurmond 186,180 votes to 158,904 votes (54% to 46%). It was the only statewide election which Thurmond lost.\n\nIn 1952, Thurmond endorsed Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] for the Presidency, rather than the Democratic [[nominee]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. State Democratic Party leaders blocked Thurmond from receiving the nomination to the Senate in 1954, and he ran as a write-in candidate.\n\n==Elected to the Senate and 1950s==\nThe incumbent U.S. Senator, [[Burnet R. Maybank]], was unopposed for re-election in 1954, but he died in September of that year, two months before Election Day. Democratic leaders hurriedly appointed [[South Carolina Senate|state Senator]] [[Edgar A. Brown]], a member of the Barnwell Ring, as the party's nominee to replace Maybank. The Brown campaign was managed by future Governor [[John C. West]]. In a state where the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination was [[tantamount to election]], many criticized the party's failure to elect a candidate by a primary vote. Thurmond announced he would mount [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1954|a write-in campaign]].\n\nAt the recommendation of Governor [[James F. Byrnes|James Byrnes]], Thurmond campaigned on the pledge that if he won, he would resign in 1956 to force a primary election which could be contested.\n\nThurmond won the 1954 election overwhelmingly, becoming the first person to be elected to the [[South Carolina United States Senate election, 1954|U.S. Senate]] as a [[write-in candidate]] against ballot-listed opponents.  As promised, in 1956 Thurmond resigned to run in the party primary, which he won. Afterward, he was repeatedly elected to the U.S. Senate by state voters until his retirement 46 years later.\n\nIn January 1955, Thurmond stated that federal encroachment with states' rights was among the biggest threats to American life and that he had studied the issue of federal encroachment which he furthered violated the Constitution. Thurmond spoke of the importance of education, saying it \"should be a primary duty of the states just as national defense is a primary obligation of the federal government.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Thurmond Warns Of Federal Threat To States Rights|publisher=Monroe Morning World|date=January 9, 1955}}</ref> In April 1955, President Eisenhower sent Thurmond a telegram requesting that he give Byrnes his greetings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10453|title=73 \u2013 Telegram to Senator Thurmond Saluting James F.

Nixon]] despite the sudden last-minute entry of [[governor of California|Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] of [[California]] into the race. [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] was also in the race but having little effect. In the fall 1968 general election, Nixon won South Carolina with 38 percent of the popular vote and gained South Carolina's [[United States Electoral College|electoral]] votes. With the segregationist Democrat [[George Wallace]] on the ballot, the South Carolina Democratic voters split almost evenly between the Democratic Party nominee, [[Hubert Humphrey]], who received 29.6 percent of the total vote, and Wallace, who received 32.3 percent. Other Deep South states swung to Wallace and posted weak totals for Nixon.\n\nThurmond had quieted conservative fears over rumors that Nixon planned to ask either liberal Republicans [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] or [[Mark Hatfield]] to be his running mate. He informed Nixon that both men were unacceptable to the South for the vice-presidency. Nixon ultimately asked [[governor of Maryland|Governor]] [[Spiro Agnew]] from Maryland\u2014an acceptable choice to Thurmond\u2014to join the ticket.\n\nDuring the general election campaign, Agnew stated that he did not believe Thurmond was a racist when asked his opinion on the matter.

With a like-minded president in the White House, Thurmond became a very effective power broker in Washington. His staffers said his goal was to be South Carolina's \"indispensable man\" in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the 1970 gubernatorial election, Thurmond's preferred candidate, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert W. Watson]], was defeated by the more moderate opponent, Democrat [[John C. West]], who had opposed Thurmond's initial write-in election to the Senate and the outgoing [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]]. Watson had defected to the Republicans in 1965, the year after Thurmond's own bolt, and had been politically close to the senator. Watson lost mainly after several Republican officials in South Carolina shied away from him because of his continuing opposition to civil rights legislation. Watson's loss caused Thurmond slowly to moderate his own image in regard to changing race relations.\n\nIn 1970, Thurmond urged Nixon to nominate another South Carolina Republican convert, [[Joseph O. Rogers Jr.]], to a federal judgeship; he had been the party's unsuccessful 1966 gubernatorial nominee against the Democrat [[Robert Evander McNair]]. At the time Rogers was the [[U.S. Attorney]] in South Carolina. When his judicial nomination dragged on, Rogers resigned as U.S. attorney and withdrew from consideration. He blamed the Nixon administration, which he and Thurmond had helped to bring to power, for failure to advance his nomination in the Senate because of opposition to the appointment from the [[NAACP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/scpc/Rogers.pdf|title=Joseph O.

In November 1941, officers arrived at the Logue family home to arrest Sue Logue and her brother-in-law for their hiring of the hit man who murdered Davis Timmerman. George Louge and Fred Dorn ambushed the officers after they were allowed entry into the home, the sheriff and deputy both being fatally wounded by the duo. Thurmond, who learned of the shooting while attending a morning church service, became concerned of further violence and drove to the home. On arriving, he removed his jacket and vest while turning his pockets inside out to show that he was without a weapon, then walked inside the home and confronted a Logue family friend who had aimed a shotgun at him. Thurmond persuaded Sue Logue to surrender with the promise that he would secure her safe passage through the hostile crowd that had assembled outside following the murders of the officers. His act was the subject of a multitude of stories in South Carolina newspapers for the following days.

After Thurmond missed a party meeting in December of that year in which the States' Rights Democratic Party announced the creation of a state's rights institute in Washington, columnist John Temples Graves, disappointed in Thurmond's absence, opined that his campaign had been the best argument that the States' Rights Democratic Party was a national movement centered around the future of liberty and restrained government. Thurmond concurrently received counsel from Walter Brown and Robert Figgs to break from the party and seek reclaiming credentials that would validate him in the minds of others as a liberal. Biographer Joseph Crespino observed that Thurmond was aware that he could neither completely abandon the Democratic Party as it embraced the civil rights initiative of the Truman administration nor let go of his supporters within the States' Rights Democratic Party, who he courted for support in his 1950 campaign for the Senate.<ref>{{cite book|title=Strom Thurmond's America|first=Joseph|last=Crespino|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/85 85\u201386.]|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=978-0809094806|url=https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/85}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently with Thurmond's discontent, former Senator and Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]] began speaking out against the Truman administration's domestic policies. Throughout 1949, Thurmond delivered addresses similar to that of Byrne's earlier in the year, asserting that the United States was inching closer to socialism and the welfare state as they lost their local sovereignty under the Truman administration. Walter Brown sought to link the 1950 gubernatorial campaign of Byrnes with the Thurmond Senate campaign as part of a collective effort against President Truman. Within a day of each other, as Byrnes delivered remarks opposing Truman and Thurmond was elected Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference, the effort by Brown appeared to have been a success. Byrnes indirectly criticized Thurmond when asked by a reporter in 1950 about his governing if elected South Carolina Governor, saying he would not waste time \"appointing colonels and crowning queens\", the remark geared toward the image of Thurmond as not serious and conniving. Brown wrote to Thurmond that the comment was a death to any potential alliance between the two South Carolina politicians and Thurmond and his wife are described as looking \"like they had been shot\" when reading the Byrnes quotation in the newspaper.<ref>{{cite book|title=Strom Thurmond's America|first=Joseph|last=Crespino|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/87 87\u201388.]|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=978-0809094806|url=https://archive.org/details/stromthurmondsam0000cres/page/87}}</ref>\n\n===Early runs for Senate===\nAccording to the state constitution, Thurmond was barred from seeking a succeeding second term as governor in 1950, so he mounted a Democratic primary challenge against first-term U.S. Senator [[Olin Johnston]]. By February 1950, reporter Eleanor Nance had distributed a story saying Washington political circles had concluded Thurmond would not mount a senatorial bid, but the report remained unpublished due to convictions within South Carolina that Thurmond was a candidate without having announced that he was.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19500213&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Thurmond Not Candidate?|date=February 13, 1950|publisher=Herald-Journal}}</ref> On May 1, Thurmond's Senate campaign headquarters opened in Columbia, South Carolina with Ernest Craig serving as campaign leader and George McNabb in charge of public relations while both were on leave from their state positions in the governor's office.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19500502&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Thurmond Opens Campaign Center|date=May 2, 1950|publisher=Herald-Journal}}</ref> In the one-party state of the time, the Democratic primary was the only competitive contest. Both candidates denounced President Truman during the campaign. Johnston defeated Thurmond 186,180 votes to 158,904 votes (54% to 46%). It was the only statewide election which Thurmond lost.\n\nIn 1952, Thurmond endorsed Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] for the Presidency, rather than the Democratic [[nominee]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. State Democratic Party leaders blocked Thurmond from receiving the nomination to the Senate in 1954, and he ran as a write-in candidate.\n\n==Elected to the Senate and 1950s==\nThe incumbent U.S. Senator, [[Burnet R. Maybank]], was unopposed for re-election in 1954, but he died in September of that year, two months before Election Day. Democratic leaders hurriedly appointed [[South Carolina Senate|state Senator]] [[Edgar A. Brown]], a member of the Barnwell Ring, as the party's nominee to replace Maybank. The Brown campaign was managed by future Governor [[John C. West]]. In a state where the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination was [[tantamount to election]], many criticized the party's failure to elect a candidate by a primary vote. Thurmond announced he would mount [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1954|a write-in campaign]].\n\nAt the recommendation of Governor [[James F. Byrnes|James Byrnes]], Thurmond campaigned on the pledge that if he won, he would resign in 1956 to force a primary election which could be contested.\n\nThurmond won the 1954 election overwhelmingly, becoming the first person to be elected to the [[South Carolina United States Senate election, 1954|U.S. Senate]] as a [[write-in candidate]] against ballot-listed opponents.  As promised, in 1956 Thurmond resigned to run in the party primary, which he won. Afterward, he was repeatedly elected to the U.S. Senate by state voters until his retirement 46 years later.\n\nIn January 1955, Thurmond stated that federal encroachment with states' rights was among the biggest threats to American life and that he had studied the issue of federal encroachment which he furthered violated the Constitution. Thurmond spoke of the importance of education, saying it \"should be a primary duty of the states just as national defense is a primary obligation of the federal government.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Thurmond Warns Of Federal Threat To States Rights|publisher=Monroe Morning World|date=January 9, 1955}}</ref> In April 1955, President Eisenhower sent Thurmond a telegram requesting that he give Byrnes his greetings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10453|title=73 \u2013 Telegram to Senator Thurmond Saluting James F.

With a like-minded president in the White House, Thurmond became a very effective power broker in Washington. His staffers said his goal was to be South Carolina's \"indispensable man\" in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the 1970 gubernatorial election, Thurmond's preferred candidate, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert W. Watson]], was defeated by the more moderate opponent, Democrat [[John C. West]], who had opposed Thurmond's initial write-in election to the Senate and the outgoing [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]]. Watson had defected to the Republicans in 1965, the year after Thurmond's own bolt, and had been politically close to the senator. Watson lost mainly after several Republican officials in South Carolina shied away from him because of his continuing opposition to civil rights legislation. Watson's loss caused Thurmond slowly to moderate his own image in regard to changing race relations.\n\nIn 1970, Thurmond urged Nixon to nominate another South Carolina Republican convert, [[Joseph O. Rogers Jr.]], to a federal judgeship; he had been the party's unsuccessful 1966 gubernatorial nominee against the Democrat [[Robert Evander McNair]]. At the time Rogers was the [[U.S. Attorney]] in South Carolina. When his judicial nomination dragged on, Rogers resigned as U.S. attorney and withdrew from consideration. He blamed the Nixon administration, which he and Thurmond had helped to bring to power, for failure to advance his nomination in the Senate because of opposition to the appointment from the [[NAACP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/scpc/Rogers.pdf|title=Joseph O.

It has many other names that have been used such as blue-billed dove-petrel, broad-billed dove-petrel, long-billed prion, common prion, icebird, and whalebird.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe broad-billed prion is a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Pachyptila]]'', and along with the [[blue petrel]] makes up the [[Prion (bird)|prions]]. They in turn are members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Procellariidae]], and the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Procellariiformes]]. The prions are small and typically eat just [[zooplankton]];<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, B. J. (2003)</ref> however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a [[stomach oil]] made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a [[salt gland]] that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Pachyptila'', the word, comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pakhus'' and ''ptilon''. ''Pakhus'' means \"thick\" or \"stout\" and ''ptilon'' means \"a feather\". Also from the Greek language, ''prion'' comes from the word ''pri\u014dn'' meaning \"a saw\", which is in reference to its serrated edges of its [[beak|bill]].<ref name=\"Gotch\">Gotch, A. T. (1995)</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe broad-billed prion has traditional prion colours: blue-grey upperparts, white underparts, and the ever present \"M\" across its back and wings. It also has a black [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]], a dark eye stripe, and a black-tipped tail. Its [[beak|bill]] is also black.<ref name=\"ZCZ\">ZipCode Zoo (19 Jun 2009)</ref> The head pattern is more distinct and the tail band is less extensive than that of the similar [[fairy prion]]. It has a broad flat bill with comb-like fringes called [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This is a large prion measuring {{convert|25|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a wingspan of {{convert|57|to|66|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighing on average {{convert|160|to|235|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThey are social birds; however their courtship displays happen at night or in their burrows. When they need to defend their nests they are very aggressive with calling, posturing, and neck-biting.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThey are [[gregarious]], and eat [[crustaceans]] ([[copepods]]), [[squid]], and [[fish]]. They utilize a technique called hydroplaning, where the bird flies with its bill in the water, skimming water in, and then [[Filter feeder|filtering]] the food. They also surface-seize. This prion doesn't follow fishing boats regularly.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n===Breeding===\nBreeding begins on the coastal slopes, lava fields, or cliffs of the breeding islands in July or August, as they lay their single [[bird egg|egg]] in a burrow type nest. Both parents [[avian incubation|incubate]] the egg for 50 days, and then spend another 50 days raising the chick.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/> The main predators are [[skua]]s, although on some islands, cats and rats have reduced this prion's numbers drastically.

It has many other names that have been used such as blue-billed dove-petrel, broad-billed dove-petrel, long-billed prion, common prion, icebird, and whalebird.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe broad-billed prion is a member of the [[Pachyptila]] [[genus]], and along with the [[blue petrel]] makes up the [[Prion (bird)|prions]]. They in turn are members of the [[Procellariidae]] [[family (biology)|family]], and the [[Procellariiformes]] [[order (biology)|order]]. The prions are small and typically eat just [[zooplankton]];<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, B. J. (2003)</ref> however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a [[stomach oil]] made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a [[salt gland]] that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Pachyptila'', the word, comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pakhus'' and ''ptilon''. ''Pakhus'' means \"thick\" or \"stout\" and ''ptilon'' means \"a feather\". Also from the Greek language, ''prion'' comes from the word ''pri\u014dn'' meaning \"a saw\", which is in reference to its serrated edges of its [[beak|bill]].<ref name=\"Gotch\">Gotch, A. T. (1995)</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe broad-billed prion has traditional prion colours: blue-grey upperparts, white underparts, and the ever present \"M\" across its back and wings. It also has a black [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]], a dark eye stripe, and a black-tipped tail. Its [[beak|bill]] is also black.<ref name=\"ZCZ\">ZipCode Zoo (19 Jun 2009)</ref> The head pattern is more distinct and the tail band is less extensive than that of the similar [[fairy prion]]. It has a broad flat bill with comb-like fringes called [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This is a large prion measuring {{convert|25|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a wingspan of {{convert|57|to|66|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighing on average {{convert|160|to|235|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThey are social birds; however their courtship displays happen at night or in their burrows. When they need to defend their nests they are very aggressive with calling, posturing, and neck-biting.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThey are [[gregarious]], and eat [[crustaceans]] ([[copepods]]), [[squid]], and [[fish]]. They utilize a technique called hydroplaning, where the bird flies with its bill in the water, skimming water in, and then [[Filter feeder|filtering]] the food. They also surface-seize. This prion doesn't follow fishing boats regularly.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n===Breeding===\nBreeding begins on the coastal slopes, lava fields, or cliffs of the breeding islands in July or August, as they lay their single [[bird egg|egg]] in a burrow type nest. Both parents [[avian incubation|incubate]] the egg for 50 days, and then spend another 50 days raising the chick.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/> The main predators are [[skua]]s, although on some islands, cats and rats have reduced this prion's numbers drastically.

Together with Herbie, the \"Love Bug\", a 1963 [[Volkswagen Beetle]], they are participating in the fictional Trans-France Race, from [[Paris, France]], to [[Monte Carlo, Monaco]]. According to dialogue, they hope to stage a racing comeback in the event. \n\nFor the Trans-France Race, Douglas and Herbie have three major opponents. The first is '''Bruno Von Stickle'''. ([[Eric Braeden]]), a German driver with experience in the \"European Racing Circuit\". He is deemed to be a formidable contender prior to and during the race. The second is '''Claude Gilbert''' (Mike Kulcsar), a French driver. His dominance in the race seemed similar to that of von Stickle, until he crashed in the later stages. The third is '''Diane Darcy''' ([[Julie Sommars]]), a very beautiful, if somewhat icy and feminist-minded, young American woman and the only female driver in the Trans-France Race. She initially hates Jim for apparently his, but what was actually Herbie's, knee-jerk behavior that ruined her chances of succeeding during the first qualifying rounds. This was because of Herbie sighting and falling in love at first sight with her race car.  As being a car with whom Herbie falls in love during the film (much as Jim seems to be attracted to Diane herself), Herbie's infatuation with Diane's Lancia results in his compromising his full original plan of winning the Trans-France Race, and turning against that same will of his partners, Jim and Wheely. However, the strong-willed Diane does not appear to believe in any cars that can be alive and have a mind of their own. \n\nDiane and her Lancia unfortunately crash into a lake towards the end of the race, and with victory in sight. But Herbie and Jim manage to save both car and woman from drowning. Because of this, she soon changes her attitude toward Jim after he saves her life and she witnesses Herbie towing her Lancia out of the lake. All three watch as Herbie crawls next to the Lancia and the two cars hold doors like holding hands. When Herbie seems to have trouble restarting because of being determined to stay with the Lancia, Diane is now fully convinced that cars can have minds of their own because she now knows her own car is alive as well. She encourages the little car not to relent in the quest for victory in the Trans-France Race.  With Diane now out of the race (followed shortly thereafter by Claude Gilbert in the aforementioned crash), Jim pursues Von Stickle through the streets of Monte Carlo, combatants in a thrilling duel for the win. In the end, though, Bruno von Stickle is overtaken by the little car in the famous tunnel of the [[Formula One]] race track, Herbie outracing him by outsmarting him through driving upside down on the tunnel roof. Jim drives Herbie to victory for (also according to dialogue) the 20th time in their careers.\n\nAs the film progresses, two thieves, Max ([[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]]) and Quincey ([[Roy Kinnear]]), steal the famous ''\u00c9toile de Joie'' (French for \"Star of Joy\") diamond and cleverly hide it in Herbie's fuel tank (Herbie was fitted with an external fuel filler cap for this film - a 1963 Beetle's cap actually being inside the front luggage compartment) in order to avoid being captured by a swarm of searching policemen. But little did they know that they picked the wrong car to hide it in, because of one car that was alive and had a mind of its own. That causes them to blow every chance they get in getting back the diamond they hid in him. Because of this, and on a count of an attempt where they at one point tried to threaten Jim and Wheely at gunpoint to relinquish the car to them, an encounter from which Herbie managed to escape, and thanks to a misunderstood conclusion thereafter that Diane would have tried to mastermind the whole event. Subsequently, Herbie is placed under the protection of the French police. \nIt is also revealed not too far in that Inspector Bouchet ([[Jacques Marin]]), also known as \"Double X\" especially as a code name to the thieves, is the mastermind behind the museum robbery, though the fact of his scheme is revealed near the end of the movie. It is the eager, and somewhat knee-jerk and unpunctual young detective Fontenoy ([[Xavier Saint-Macary]]), of whom the Inspector is the superior officer, who unravels the mystery of L'\u00c9toile de Joie, and has Bouchet clapped in handcuffs. \n\nIn the end, Jim and Diane begin to fall in love, as do Wheely and the Monte Carlo trophy girl (Katia Tchenko); even breaking a pact they made in the beginning. Most of all, Herbie and Giselle (Diane's Lancia) fall in love again as well.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Jim Douglas\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Wheely Applegate\n* [[Julie Sommars]] as Diane Darcy\n* [[Jacques Marin]] as Inspector Bouchet\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Quincey\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Max\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as Bruno von Stickle\n* [[Xavier Saint-Macary]] as Detective Fontenoy\n* Fran\u00e7ois Lalande as Monsieur Ribeaux, the owner of the Museum \"\u00c9toile de Joie\" Diamond.\n* [[Alan Caillou]] as Emile, the Chief Monaco Official\n* [[Laurie Main]] as Duval, the Museum Guard\n* Mike Kulcsar as Claude Gilbert\n* [[Johnny Haymer]] as Race official\n* Stanley Brock as Taxi driver\n* [[G\u00e9rard Jugnot]] as Waiter\n{{col-2}}\n* Jean-Marie Proslier as Doorman\n* Tom McCorry as Showroom M.C.\n* Lloyd Nelson as Mechanic\n* Jean-Jacques Moreau as Truck driver\n* Yveline Bri\u00e8re as Girl friend\n* S\u00e9bastien Floche as French tourist\n* Madeleine Damien as Old woman\n* Alain Janey as Man at caf\u00e9\n* Raoul Defosse as Police Captain\n* Ed Marcus as Exhibit M.C.\n* [[Dick Warlock|Richard Warlock]], Gerald Brutsche, Kevin Johnston, Bob Harris, [[Carey Loftin]], Jesse Wayne, Bill Erickson as The drivers\n* [[Katia Tchenko]] as Monte Carlo trophy girl (uncredited)\n* [[Josiane Balasko]] as Woman in the crowd (uncredited)\n* Andr\u00e9 Penvern as French policeman (uncredited)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Promotion==\n\n===Mann's Chinese Theatre===\nOn July 11, 1977, [[Herbie]] joined other immortals of the silver screen when he placed his wheel-prints in cement in the forecourt of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]; the ceremony was also attended by the film's stars [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[Julie Sommars]], as well as several hundred guests and tourists.

Together with Herbie, the \"Love Bug\", a 1963 [[Volkswagen Beetle]], they are participating in the fictional Trans-France Race, from [[Paris, France]], to [[Monte Carlo, Monaco]]. According to dialogue, they hope to stage a racing comeback in the event. \n\nFor the Trans-France Race, Douglas and Herbie have three major opponents. The first is '''Bruno Von Stickle'''. ([[Eric Braeden]]), a German driver with experience in the \"European Racing Circuit\". He is deemed to be a formidable contender prior to and during the race. The second is '''Claude Gilbert''' (Mike Kulcsar), a French driver. His dominance in the race seemed similar to that of von Stickle, until he crashed in the later stages. The third is '''Diane Darcy''' ([[Julie Sommars]]), a very beautiful, if somewhat icy and feminist-minded, young American woman and the only female driver in the Trans-France Race. She initially hates Jim for apparently his, but what was actually Herbie's, knee-jerk behavior that ruined her chances of succeeding during the first qualifying rounds. This was because of Herbie sighting and falling in love at first sight with her race car.  As being a car with whom Herbie falls in love during the film (much as Jim seems to be attracted to Diane herself), Herbie's infatuation with Diane's Lancia results in his compromising his full original plan of winning the Trans-France Race, and turning against that same will of his partners, Jim and Wheely. However, the strong-willed Diane does not appear to believe in any cars that can be alive and have a mind of their own. \n\nDiane and her Lancia unfortunately crash into a lake towards the end of the race, and with victory in sight. But Herbie and Jim manage to save both car and woman from drowning. Because of this, she soon changes her attitude toward Jim after he saves her life and she witnesses Herbie towing her Lancia out of the lake. All three watch as Herbie crawls next to the Lancia and the two cars hold doors like holding hands. When Herbie seems to have trouble restarting because of being determined to stay with the Lancia, Diane is now fully convinced that cars can have minds of their own because she now knows her own car is alive as well. She encourages the little car not to relent in the quest for victory in the Trans-France Race.  With Diane now out of the race (followed shortly thereafter by Claude Gilbert in the aforementioned crash), Jim pursues Von Stickle through the streets of Monte Carlo, combatants in a thrilling duel for the win. In the end, though, Bruno von Stickle is overtaken by the little car in the famous tunnel of the [[Formula One]] race track, Herbie outracing him by outsmarting him through driving upside down on the tunnel roof. Jim drives Herbie to victory for (also according to dialogue) the 20th time in their careers.\n\nAs the film progresses, two thieves, Max ([[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]]) and Quincey ([[Roy Kinnear]]), steal the famous ''\u00c9toile de Joie'' (French for \"Star of Joy\") diamond and cleverly hide it in Herbie's fuel tank (Herbie was fitted with an external fuel filler cap for this film - a 1963 Beetle's cap actually being inside the front luggage compartment) in order to avoid being captured by a swarm of searching policemen. But little did they know that they picked the wrong car to hide it in, because of one car that was alive and had a mind of its own. That causes them to blow every chance they get in getting back the diamond they hid in him. Because of this, and on a count of an attempt where they at one point tried to threaten Jim and Wheely at gunpoint to relinquish the car to them, an encounter from which Herbie managed to escape, and thanks to a misunderstood conclusion thereafter that Diane would have tried to mastermind the whole event. Subsequently, Herbie is placed under the protection of the French police. \nIt is also revealed not too far in that Inspector Bouchet ([[Jacques Marin]]), also known as \"Double X\" especially as a code name to the thieves, is the mastermind behind the museum robbery, though the fact of his scheme is revealed near the end of the movie. It is the eager, and somewhat knee-jerk and unpunctual young detective Fontenoy ([[Xavier Saint-Macary]]), of whom the Inspector is the superior officer, who unravels the mystery of L'\u00c9toile de Joie, and has Bouchet clapped in handcuffs. \n\nIn the end, Jim and Diane begin to fall in love, as do Wheely and the Monte Carlo trophy girl (Katia Tchenko); even breaking a pact they made in the beginning. Most of all, Herbie and Giselle (Diane's Lancia) fall in love again as well.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Jim Douglas\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Wheely Applegate\n* [[Julie Sommars]] as Diane Darcy\n* [[Jacques Marin]] as Inspector Bouchet\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Quincey\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Max\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as Bruno von Stickle\n* [[Xavier Saint-Macary]] as Detective Fontenoy\n* Fran\u00e7ois Lalande as Monsieur Ribeaux, the owner of the Museum \"\u00c9toile de Joie\" Diamond.\n* [[Alan Caillou]] as Emile, the Chief Monaco Official\n* [[Laurie Main]] as Duval, the Museum Guard\n* Mike Kulcsar as Claude Gilbert\n* [[Johnny Haymer]] as Race official\n* Stanley Brock as Taxi driver\n* [[G\u00e9rard Jugnot]] as Waiter\n{{col-2}}\n* Jean-Marie Proslier as Doorman\n* Tom McCorry as Showroom M.C.\n* Lloyd Nelson as Mechanic\n* Jean-Jacques Moreau as Truck driver\n* Yveline Bri\u00e8re as Girl friend\n* S\u00e9bastien Floche as French tourist\n* Madeleine Damien as Old woman\n* Alain Janey as Man at caf\u00e9\n* Raoul Defosse as Police Captain\n* Ed Marcus as Exhibit M.C.\n* [[Dick Warlock|Richard Warlock]], Gerald Brutsche, Kevin Johnston, Bob Harris, [[Carey Loftin]], Jesse Wayne, Bill Erickson as The drivers\n* [[Katia Tchenko]] as Monte Carlo trophy girl (uncredited)\n* [[Josiane Balasko]] as Woman in the crowd (uncredited)\n* Andr\u00e9 Penvern as French policeman (uncredited)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Promotion==\n\n===Mann's Chinese Theatre===\nOn July 11, 1977, [[Herbie]] joined other immortals of the silver screen when he placed his wheel-prints in cement in the forecourt of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]; the ceremony was also attended by the film's stars [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[Julie Sommars]], as well as several hundred guests and tourists.

{"title_page": "List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{hatnote|This is a selective list of the works of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], listed by genre. For a complete and chronologically ordered list, see [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]].}}\n'''Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756\u20131791)''' was a prolific composer and wrote in many genres. Perhaps his best-admired work is in [[opera]], the [[piano concerto]], [[Piano sonata|sonata]], the [[symphony]], the [[string quartet]], and [[string quintet]]. Mozart also wrote many pieces for solo piano, other forms of [[chamber music]], [[mass (music)|masses]] and other religious music, and numerous dances, [[divertimento]]s, and other forms of light entertainment.\n\n== How Mozart's compositions are listed ==\n* The indication \"K.\" or \"KV\" refers to ''{{Lang|de|K\u00f6chel Verzeichnis}}'' ([[K\u00f6chel catalogue]]), i.e. the (more or less) chronological (i.e. by composition date) catalogue of Mozart's works by [[Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel|Ludwig von K\u00f6chel]]. This catalog has been amended several times, leading to ambiguity over some KV numbers (see e.g. [[Symphony No. 25 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 25]]).\n* The compositions of Mozart listed below are grouped thematically, i.e. by type of composition. Not all thematic groups of Mozart's works have a separate numbering that is generally accepted: K\u00f6chel only numbers symphonies (1 to 41), piano concertos (1 to 27, leaving out some early transcriptions by Mozart) and a few other groups. On the other hand, for most chamber music and vocal music there is no such numbering (or at least no generally accepted one).\n* Only relatively few of Mozart's compositions have [[opus number]]s, as not so many of his compositions were published during his lifetime, so numbering by opus number proves quite impractical for Mozart compositions.\n\n== Symphonies ==\n{{main article|List of symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}\nMozart's symphonic production covers a 24-year interval, from [[1764 in music|1764]] to [[1788 in music|1788]]. According to most recent investigations, Mozart wrote not just the 41 symphonies reported in traditional editions, but up to 68 complete works of this type. However, by convention, the original numbering has been retained, and so his last symphony is still known as \"No. 41\". Some of the symphonies (K. 297, 385, 550) were revised by the author after their first versions.\n\n=== Childhood symphonies (1764\u20131771) ===\nThese are the numbered symphonies from Mozart's early childhood.\n* [[Symphony No. 1 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 1]] in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 16\n* [[Symphony No. 2 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 2]] in B{{music|flat}} major, K. 17 (spurious, attributed to [[Leopold Mozart]])\n* [[Symphony No. 3 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 3]] in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 18 (spurious, by [[Carl Friedrich Abel]])\n* [[Symphony No. 4 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 4]] in D major, K. 19\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 5]] in B{{music|flat}} major, K. 22\n* [[Symphony No. 6 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 6]] in F major, K. 43\n* [[Symphony No. 7 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 7]] in D major, K. 45\n* [[Symphony No. 8 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 8]] in D major, K. 48\n* [[Symphony No. 9 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 9]] in C major, K. 73/75a\n* [[Symphony No. 10 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 10]] in G major, K. 74\n* [[Symphony No. 11 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 11]] in D major, K. 84/73q\n* [[Symphony No. 12 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 12]] in G major, K. 110/75b\n* [[Symphony No. 13 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 13]] in F major, K. 112\n\nThere are also several \"unnumbered\" symphonies from this time period. Many of them were given numbers past 41 (but not in chronological order) in an older collection of Mozart's works (''Mozart-Werke'', 1877\u20131910, referred to as \"GA\"), but newer collections refer to them only by their entries in the K\u00f6chel catalogue.

Concertos [[Piano Concerto No. 7 (Mozart)|7]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 10 (Mozart)|10]] are compositions for three and two pianos respectively. The remaining twenty-one, listed below, are original compositions for solo piano and orchestra.

They were written for Mozart's lifelong friend [[Joseph Leutgeb]]. The concertos (especially the fourth) were written as virtuoso vehicles that allow the soloist to show a variety of abilities on the valveless horns of Mozart's day.\n\nThe Horn Concertos are characterized by an elegant and humorous dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra.

Almost everything that he wrote for piano was intended to be played by himself (or by his sister, also a proficient piano player). Examples of his earliest works are those found in ''[[Nannerl's Music Book]]''.\nBetween 1782 and 1786 he wrote 20 works for piano solo (including sonatas, [[variation (music)|variations]], [[fantasia (music)|fantasias]], [[Suite (music)|suites]], [[fugue]]s, [[rondo]]) and works for piano four hands and two pianos.\n\n=== Solo piano works ===\n{{main article|List of solo piano compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}\n\n=== Dual piano/performer works ===\n\n==== Piano four-hands ====\n* [[Sonata in C major for keyboard four-hands, K. 19d|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands]] in C major, K. 19d (London, May 1765)\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in D major]], K. 381/123a\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in B-flat major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in B{{music|flat}} major]], K. 358/186c\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in F major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in F major]], K. 497\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in C major, K. 521 (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in C major]], K. 521\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in G major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in G major]], K. 357 (incomplete)\n* Fugue in G minor, K. 401\n* Andante and Variations in G major, K. 501\n* [[Adagio and Allegro in F minor for a mechanical organ, K. 594]]\n* Fantasia in F minor, K. 608 (organ, composer's transcription)\n\n==== Two pianos ====\n* [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major]], K. 448/375a\n* Fugue in C minor for Two Keyboards, K. 426 (transcribed in 1788 for strings as [[K. 546]])\n* Larghetto and Allegretto for Two Pianos in E{{music|flat}} major, K. deest (completed by [[Maximilian Stadler]])\n\n== [[Chamber music]] ==\n\n=== Violin music ===\nHe also wrote for piano and [[violin]]. Note the order of the two instruments: for the most part, these are keyboard-centric sonatas where the violin plays a more accompanying role. In later years, the role of the violin grew to not just a support to the other solo instrument, but to build a dialogue with it.\n\nThe 'Violin Sonatas', KV 10\u201315, are unique in that they include an ''[[ad libitum|ad lib.]]'' cello part along with the score for violin and keyboard. The ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' (1966) therefore includes them along with the other keyboard trios, although the [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]] (K<sup>6</sup>, 1964) lists them as normal violin sonatas.\n\n==== Childhood violin sonatas (1763\u201366) ====\n*[[Violin Sonatas, KV 6\u20139 (Mozart)|Violin Sonatas, KV 6\u20139]] (1764)\n**Violin Sonata No. 1 in C for Keyboard and Violin, K. 6\n**Violin Sonata No. 2 in D for Keyboard and Violin, K. 7\n**Violin Sonata No. 3 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin, K. 8\n**Violin Sonata No. 4 in G for Keyboard and Violin, K. 9\n*[[Violin Sonatas, KV 10\u201315 (Mozart)|Violin Sonatas, KV 10\u201315]] (1764)\n**Violin Sonata No. 5 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 10\n**Violin Sonata No. 6 in G for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 11\n**Violin Sonata No. 7 in A for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 12\n**Violin Sonata No. 8 in F for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 13\n**Violin Sonata No. 9 in C for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 14\n**Violin Sonata No. 10 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute) with cello, K. 15\n*[[Violin Sonatas, KV 26\u201331 (Mozart)|Violin Sonatas, KV 26\u201331]] (1766)\n**Violin Sonata No. 11 in E{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin, K. 26\n**Violin Sonata No. 12 in G for Keyboard and Violin, K. 27\n**Violin Sonata No. 13 in C for Keyboard and Violin, K. 28\n**Violin Sonata No. 14 in D for Keyboard and Violin, K. 29\n**Violin Sonata No. 15 in F for Keyboard and Violin, K. 30\n**Violin Sonata No. 16 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin, K. 31\n\n==== Mature violin sonatas (1778\u201388) ====\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 17 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 17 in C major, K. 296]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 18 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 18 in G major, K. 301]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 19 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 19 in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 302]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 20 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 20 in C major, K. 303]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 21 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 21 in E minor, K. 304]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 22 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 22 in A major, K. 305]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 23 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 23 in D major, K. 306]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 24 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 24 in F major, K. 376]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 25 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 25 in F major, K. 377]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 26 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 26 in B{{music|flat}} major, K. 378]] (1779)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 27 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 27 in G major, K. 379]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 28 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 28 in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 380]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 29 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 29 in A major, K. 402]] (1782; fragment, completed by [[Maximilian Stadler|M.

For a complete and chronologically ordered list, see [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]].}}\n'''Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756\u20131791)''' was a prolific composer and wrote in many genres. Perhaps his best-admired work is in [[opera]], the [[piano concerto]], [[Piano sonata|sonata]], the [[symphony]], the [[string quartet]], and [[string quintet]]. Mozart also wrote many pieces for solo piano, other forms of [[chamber music]], [[mass (music)|masses]] and other religious music, and numerous dances, [[divertimento]]s, and other forms of light entertainment.\n\n== How Mozart's compositions are listed ==\n* The indication \"K.\" or \"KV\" refers to ''{{Lang|de|K\u00f6chel Verzeichnis}}'' ([[K\u00f6chel catalogue]]), i.e. the (more or less) chronological (i.e. by composition date) catalogue of Mozart's works by [[Ludwig Ritter von K\u00f6chel|Ludwig von K\u00f6chel]]. This catalog has been amended several times, leading to ambiguity over some KV numbers (see e.g. [[Symphony No. 25 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 25]]).\n* The compositions of Mozart listed below are grouped thematically, i.e. by type of composition. Not all thematic groups of Mozart's works have a separate numbering that is generally accepted: K\u00f6chel only numbers symphonies (1 to 41), piano concertos (1 to 27, leaving out some early transcriptions by Mozart) and a few other groups. On the other hand, for most chamber music and vocal music there is no such numbering (or at least no generally accepted one).\n* Only relatively few of Mozart's compositions have [[opus number]]s, as not so many of his compositions were published during his lifetime, so numbering by opus number proves quite impractical for Mozart compositions.\n\n== Symphonies ==\n{{main article|List of symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}\nMozart's symphonic production covers a 24-year interval, from [[1764 in music|1764]] to [[1788 in music|1788]]. According to most recent investigations, Mozart wrote not just the 41 symphonies reported in traditional editions, but up to 68 complete works of this type. However, by convention, the original numbering has been retained, and so his last symphony is still known as \"No. 41\". Some of the symphonies (K. 297, 385, 550) were revised by the author after their first versions.\n\n=== Childhood symphonies (1764\u20131771) ===\nThese are the numbered symphonies from Mozart's early childhood.\n* [[Symphony No. 1 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 1]] in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 16\n* [[Symphony No. 2 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 2]] in B{{music|flat}} major, K. 17 (spurious, attributed to [[Leopold Mozart]])\n* [[Symphony No. 3 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 3]] in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 18 (spurious, by [[Carl Friedrich Abel]])\n* [[Symphony No. 4 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 4]] in D major, K. 19\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 5]] in B{{music|flat}} major, K. 22\n* [[Symphony No. 6 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 6]] in F major, K. 43\n* [[Symphony No. 7 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 7]] in D major, K. 45\n* [[Symphony No. 8 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 8]] in D major, K. 48\n* [[Symphony No. 9 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 9]] in C major, K. 73/75a\n* [[Symphony No. 10 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 10]] in G major, K. 74\n* [[Symphony No. 11 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 11]] in D major, K. 84/73q\n* [[Symphony No. 12 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 12]] in G major, K. 110/75b\n* [[Symphony No. 13 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 13]] in F major, K. 112\n\nThere are also several \"unnumbered\" symphonies from this time period.

Concertos [[Piano Concerto No. 7 (Mozart)|7]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 10 (Mozart)|10]] are compositions for three and two pianos respectively. The remaining twenty-one, listed below, are original compositions for solo piano and orchestra.

They were written for Mozart's lifelong friend [[Joseph Leutgeb]]. The concertos (especially the fourth) were written as virtuoso vehicles that allow the soloist to show a variety of abilities on the valveless horns of Mozart's day.\n\nThe Horn Concertos are characterized by an elegant and humorous dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra.

Almost everything that he wrote for piano was intended to be played by himself (or by his sister, also a proficient piano player). Examples of his earliest works are those found in ''[[Nannerl's Music Book]]''.\nBetween 1782 and 1786 he wrote 20 works for piano solo (including sonatas, [[variation (music)|variations]], [[fantasia (music)|fantasias]], [[Suite (music)|suites]], [[fugue]]s, [[rondo]]) and works for piano four hands and two pianos.\n\n=== Solo piano works ===\n{{main article|List of solo piano compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}\n\n=== Dual piano/performer works ===\n\n==== Piano four-hands ====\n* [[Sonata in C major for keyboard four-hands, K. 19d|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands]] in C major, K. 19d (London, May 1765)\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in D major]], K. 381/123a\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in B-flat major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in B{{music|flat}} major]], K. 358/186c\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in F major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in F major]], K. 497\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in C major, K. 521 (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in C major]], K. 521\n* [[Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in G major (Mozart)|Sonata for Keyboard Four-hands in G major]], K. 357 (incomplete)\n* Fugue in G minor, K. 401\n* Andante and Variations in G major, K. 501\n* [[Adagio and Allegro in F minor for a mechanical organ, K. 594]]\n* Fantasia in F minor, K. 608 (organ, composer's transcription)\n\n==== Two pianos ====\n* [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major]], K. 448/375a\n* Fugue in C minor for Two Keyboards, K. 426 (transcribed in 1788 for strings as [[K. 546]])\n* Larghetto and Allegretto for Two Pianos in E{{music|flat}} major, K. deest (completed by [[Maximilian Stadler]])\n\n== [[Chamber music]] ==\n\n=== Violin music ===\nHe also wrote for piano and [[violin]]. Note the order of the two instruments: for the most part, these are keyboard-centric sonatas where the violin plays a more accompanying role. In later years, the role of the violin grew to not just a support to the other solo instrument, but to build a dialogue with it.\n\nThe 'Violin Sonatas', KV 10\u201315, are unique in that they include an ''[[ad libitum|ad lib.]]'' cello part along with the score for violin and keyboard. The ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' (1966) therefore includes them along with the other keyboard trios, although the [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]] (K<sup>6</sup>, 1964) lists them as normal violin sonatas.\n\n==== Childhood violin sonatas (1763\u201366) ====\n*[[Violin Sonatas, KV 6\u20139 (Mozart)|Violin Sonatas, KV 6\u20139]] (1764)\n**Violin Sonata No. 1 in C for Keyboard and Violin, K. 6\n**Violin Sonata No. 2 in D for Keyboard and Violin, K. 7\n**Violin Sonata No. 3 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin, K. 8\n**Violin Sonata No. 4 in G for Keyboard and Violin, K. 9\n*[[Violin Sonatas, KV 10\u201315 (Mozart)|Violin Sonatas, KV 10\u201315]] (1764)\n**Violin Sonata No. 5 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 10\n**Violin Sonata No. 6 in G for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 11\n**Violin Sonata No. 7 in A for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 12\n**Violin Sonata No. 8 in F for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 13\n**Violin Sonata No. 9 in C for Keyboard with Violin (or Flute) and cello, K. 14\n**Violin Sonata No. 10 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute) with cello, K. 15\n*[[Violin Sonatas, KV 26\u201331 (Mozart)|Violin Sonatas, KV 26\u201331]] (1766)\n**Violin Sonata No. 11 in E{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin, K. 26\n**Violin Sonata No. 12 in G for Keyboard and Violin, K. 27\n**Violin Sonata No. 13 in C for Keyboard and Violin, K. 28\n**Violin Sonata No. 14 in D for Keyboard and Violin, K. 29\n**Violin Sonata No. 15 in F for Keyboard and Violin, K. 30\n**Violin Sonata No. 16 in B{{music|flat}} for Keyboard and Violin, K. 31\n\n==== Mature violin sonatas (1778\u201388) ====\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 17 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 17 in C major, K. 296]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 18 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 18 in G major, K. 301]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 19 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 19 in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 302]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 20 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 20 in C major, K. 303]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 21 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 21 in E minor, K. 304]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 22 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 22 in A major, K. 305]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 23 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 23 in D major, K. 306]] (1778)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 24 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 24 in F major, K. 376]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 25 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 25 in F major, K. 377]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 26 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 26 in B{{music|flat}} major, K. 378]] (1779)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 27 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 27 in G major, K. 379]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 28 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 28 in E{{music|flat}} major, K. 380]] (1781)\n* [[Violin Sonata No. 29 (Mozart)|Violin Sonata No. 29 in A major, K. 402]] (1782; fragment, completed by [[Maximilian Stadler|M.

The movie was directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]], produced by [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]] and starred [[Helen Hayes]], [[Stefanie Powers]], [[Ken Berry]], and [[Keenan Wynn]] reprising his villainous role as [[Alonzo Hawk]] (originated in the films ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' starring [[Fred MacMurray]] as Professor Ned Brainard).\n\n''Herbie Rides Again'' was followed by two more theatrical sequels ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' and ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]''. A later theatrical sequel, ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'' was released in 2005.\n\nThe title is referenced in the trailer for the 1975 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nNotorious real estate magnate and [[Building demolition|demolition]] baron [[Alonzo Hawk]] ([[Keenan Wynn]]) is ready to build his newest indoor shopping center, the 130-story Hawk Plaza in San Francisco. His only obstacle is the 1892 [[Fire station|firehouse]] inhabited by \"Grandma\" Steinmetz ([[Helen Hayes]]), widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic [[The Love Bug|Tennessee Steinmetz]]; her displaced neighbor, flight attendant Nicole Harris ([[Stefanie Powers]]); and their sentient machines: a [[Volkswagen Beetle|1963 Volkswagen Beetle]] known as Herbie, \"the Love Bug;\" an early 20th-century  [[orchestrion]] that plays on its own; and a retired [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] from the [[Clay Street Hill Railroad|defunct Clay Street Line]], known as \"Old No. 22.\" \n \nHawk has made numerous attempts at evicting Mrs. Steinmetz, intending to imprison her in a [[retirement home]] of his own making; but Hawk's lawyers have been unsuccessful in these attempts, while Mr. Barnsdorf, the construction boss, is growing impatient with Hawk's alleged indecision, reminding him that the whole thing is costing him $80,000 a day (equal to ${{Inflation|US|80000|1974}} today). Therefore, when Hawk's lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield ([[Ken Berry]]) comes to visit him, Hawk sends him to Mrs. Steinmetz in their stead.\n\nMrs. Steinmetz takes a liking to the young lawyer due to his youthful looks and good manners, in contrast to Hawk's henchmen. It is during her chatting with him that she explains the backstories of Herbie and Old No. 22, which Herbie found on a vacant lot whose owners were using it as a chicken house. She also explains that Tennessee has gone to [[Tibet]] to visit his ailing philosophy teacher, while Herbie's former owner, Jim Douglas, has gone to Europe racing foreign cars. On first meeting Willoughby, Nicole punches him in the face upon learning that he works for Hawk, but then tries to make up to him by offering him a ride in Herbie. Herbie goes berserk after Willoughby insults him twice, eventually taking the two to a [[Demolition derby|car version]] of a [[joust]] tournament, which Herbie wins over a character named \"The Red Knight\" (strongly resembling retired racer Peter Thorndyke from the previous film), earning Willoughby a whopping $3.00 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|3|1974|r=2}} today).  The two then go to lunch, but Nicole tells Willboughy an uninterrupted monologue on all the horrible things Hawk has done, including building a [[parking garage]] on the very same lot where [[Joe DiMaggio]] and his brothers learned to play [[baseball]]. Willoughby is upset about this and accidentally tells her that Hawk is his uncle, which enrages Nicole.  She hits him with a broiled lobster in response, sending him splashing into the waters of [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]] below.\n\nHaving become disillusioned towards his uncle, Willoughby decides to tell him face to face that he will not continue doing his dirty work. However, as he is approaching the office, he overhears his uncle threatening body harm on him for not getting in contact, so he resorts to telling him on the phone instead. Hawk flips out and shouts at his nephew, shattering the glass on the phone booth. Having lost him, Hawk decides to resort to harassment to force Mrs. Steinmetz out, the first act of which is to capture Herbie. Hawk is initially successful with his hotwiring skills, but while driving him on the street, Hawk insults the car who retaliates by causing a series of traffic collisions and jams (even going as far as barging into a police car, which causes a chain reaction of wrecks) and discards Hawk at his own office door, where Hawk orders his subordinates to capture Herbie again, followed by a policeman giving Hawk several tickets for traffic offenses. While Herbie takes Mrs. Steinmetz to market, they are chased by Hawk's men; whereupon Herbie makes several daring escapes culminating in travelling through the 1909 landmark [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Sheraton Palace Hotel]] and along a suspension cable on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], leaving Mrs. Steinmetz unfazed (and unaware) of his activity throughout.  Hawk's [[secretary]] catches sight of Herbie on the bridge, but Hawk assumes she's getting hysterical and orders her to take two aspirins and lie down.\n\nWilloughby initially tries to go home in disguise, but is convinced by Nicole to stay after she hears him criticize his uncle while talking to his mother on the telephone.  Mrs. Steinmetz asks Nicole and Willoughby to pick up some more groceries for her, and then suggests that they ought to drive to the beach.  Nicole insists that they will just go and get some [[broccoli]], which Willoughby later confesses he doesn't like, but Herbie still goes to the beach as a result of Hawk's personal [[chauffeur]] chasing him, leading Nicole to think that Mrs. Steinmetz talked him into doing it. They enjoy a nice moment at the beach, with Willoughby and Nicole falling for each other.\n\nWhile heading home, they discover that the roadway has been blocked (due to Hawk's chauffeur having bribed a man to do so), so Herbie resorts to surfing through the coastal bay to find an alternate route. On their return to the firehouse after dark, they find that every item of furniture has been removed by Hawk; whereupon Mrs. Steinmetz, Willoughby, Nicole, and Herbie track the theft to a warehouse. The four break in and recover Steinmetz's belongings, all of which had been loaded into \"No. 22.\"  Upon hearing Willoughby's voice, the orchestrion attracts their attention by playing \"[[Pomp and Circumstance]].\"  Hawk's hired security guards catch them in the act, but Herbie's acts of pushing other items off the warehouse shelves trap them and allow the trio to escape.  Mrs. Steinmetz rides in \"No. 22,\" while Willoughby and Nicole follow in Herbie.\n\nAn inebriated old-timer named Judson ([[John McIntire]]) joins Mrs Steinmetz aboard \"No. 22,\" thinking himself on a [[San Francisco cable car system|public cable car]]. Hawk pursues upon discovering the trio escaped, but Herbie distracts him and later rescues Mrs. Steinmetz and Judson from a potential crash after \"No. 22\" rolls down a hill (as well as into a building during a special [[Party#Dinner Party|dinner party]]) by getting Willoughby close enough so that he can jump aboard and use the handbrake. During this time, Mrs. Steinmetz becomes enamored with Judson (while being entirely oblivious to the fact the car is rolling down the hill).\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself. Accompanied by Willoughby in spite of Nicole telling him not to let her do this, Mrs. Steinmetz drives Herbie onto the window-cleaning machine of Hawk\u2019s skyscraper to reach his 28th-floor office (after Hawk fired his window cleaner), where they overhear a telephoned conversation with Loostgarten ([[Chuck McCann]]), an independent [[Demolition|demolition agent]], about the deal to demolish the firehouse. In response, she activates the window cleaning machine to fill the office with foam and water. This done, Herbie pursues Hawk around the building's perimeter (in response to Hawk throwing an [[ashtray]] at him) - even following him outside onto a ledge - until Mrs Steinmetz orders him to desist by mentioning a used car lot, and saying she would have to hate to call the used car man, Mr. Honest Al.\n\nDisguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby directs Loostgarten to demolish Hawk's own house. Late that evening, Loostgarten telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from several nightmares showing himself at the mercy of Herbie; Hawk then gives confirmation, but realizes too late that he has condemned his own residence, and subsequently attacks Loostgarten after a portion of his house is collapsed from a wrecking ball.\n\nIn the morning, Hawk calls a truce with Mrs. Steinmetz (as well as plant a phony story in the newspaper with the headline \"HAWK GIVES UP\"!), and thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner (to the same restaurant they were before when Nicole hit Willoughby with the broiled lobster), while Mrs. Steinmetz invites Judson to a similar meeting; in spite of this, Hawk violates the truce by sending [[Heavy equipment (construction)|earthmovers]] to crush the firehouse and its inhabitants, prompting Herbie to go in search of Nicole and Willoughby. In the absence of Herbie, the only means of defense is an antique [[fire hose]], which Judson uses against the earthmovers, until it explodes and sprays all over him.\n\nHaving obtained Nicole and Willoughby, Herbie rounds up several other Volkswagen Beetles from various places in the city (some of which leave their owners behind), and comes after Hawk and his men as an army and ruin his scheme, taking advantage of Hawk's irrational fear of Herbie. Hawk is pursued from the grounds by Herbie, and after nearly getting knocked down by a police car, Hawk is arrested after telling his bizarre tale of an army of Beetles chasing him. Later, Nicole and Willoughby are married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his new Volkswagen Beetle friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Helen Hayes]] as Mrs. Steinmetz\n* [[Ken Berry]] as Willoughby Whitfield\n* [[Stefanie Powers]] as Nicole Harris Whitfield\n* [[John McIntire]] as Mr. Judson\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Alonzo A.

[[Dan Tobin]], [[Raymond Bailey]], [[Ignatius Wolfington|Iggie Wolfington]], [[Robert Carson (actor)|Robert S. Carson]], and John Zaremba played Hawk's attorneys; Disney regular [[Norm Grabowski|Norman Grabowski]] played \"Security guard #2;\" [[John Myhers]] played the San Francisco's Office of the President announcer; and Alan Carney played a judge at the Chicken Tournament.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nThe [[View-Master|GAF View-Master reel set]] for the film shows a still from a deleted sequence where one of Hawk's nightmares has him about to be treated by a pair of white VW Beetle doctors, who decide to \"take his carburetor out and have a look at it\".  As they approach Hawk, he is woken by Loostgarten.\n\n===Vehicles===\nThe Herbies used for the film consisted both of 1963 and 1965 Beetles.\n\nThe included 1965 models make for some bad [[continuity error]]s as the windows are noticeably larger on the 1965 cars.  This was to become worse in subsequent Herbie films as even later model cars were included.\n\nOne of the VW Beetles used in the deleted nightmare sequence (see above) was first used in ''The Love Bug'' as a stunt car during the El Dorado race (also used for interior filming).

The movie was directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]], produced by [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]] and starred [[Helen Hayes]], [[Stefanie Powers]], [[Ken Berry]], and [[Keenan Wynn]] reprising his villainous role as [[Alonzo Hawk]] (originated in the films ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' starring [[Fred MacMurray]] as Professor Ned Brainard).\n\n''Herbie Rides Again'' was followed by two more theatrical sequels ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' and ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]''. A later theatrical sequel, ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'' was released in 2005.\n\nThe title is referenced in the trailer for the 1975 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nNotorious real estate magnate and [[Building demolition|demolition]] baron [[Alonzo Hawk]] ([[Keenan Wynn]]) is ready to build his newest indoor shopping center, the 130-story Hawk Plaza in San Francisco. His only obstacle is the 1892 [[Fire station|firehouse]] inhabited by \"Grandma\" Steinmetz ([[Helen Hayes]]), widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic [[The Love Bug|Tennessee Steinmetz]]; her displaced neighbor, flight attendant Nicole Harris ([[Stefanie Powers]]); and their sentient machines: a [[Volkswagen Beetle|1963 Volkswagen Beetle]] known as Herbie, \"the Love Bug;\" an early 20th-century  [[orchestrion]] that plays on its own; and a retired [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] from the [[Clay Street Hill Railroad|defunct Clay Street Line]], known as \"Old No. 22.\" \n \nHawk has made numerous attempts at evicting Mrs. Steinmetz, intending to imprison her in a [[retirement home]] of his own making; but Hawk's lawyers have been unsuccessful in these attempts, while Mr. Barnsdorf, the construction boss, is growing impatient with Hawk's alleged indecision, reminding him that the whole thing is costing him $80,000 a day (equal to ${{Inflation|US|80000|1974}} today). Therefore, when Hawk's lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield ([[Ken Berry]]) comes to visit him, Hawk sends him to Mrs. Steinmetz in their stead.\n\nMrs. Steinmetz takes a liking to the young lawyer due to his youthful looks and good manners, in contrast to Hawk's henchmen. It is during her chatting with him that she explains the backstories of Herbie and Old No. 22, which Herbie found on a vacant lot whose owners were using it as a chicken house. She also explains that Tennessee has gone to [[Tibet]] to visit his ailing philosophy teacher, while Herbie's former owner, Jim Douglas, has gone to Europe racing foreign cars. On first meeting Willoughby, Nicole punches him in the face upon learning that he works for Hawk, but then tries to make up to him by offering him a ride in Herbie. Herbie goes berserk after Willoughby insults him twice, eventually taking the two to a [[Demolition derby|car version]] of a [[joust]] tournament, which Herbie wins over a character named \"The Red Knight\" (strongly resembling retired racer Peter Thorndyke from the previous film), earning Willoughby a whopping $3.00 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|3|1974|r=2}} today).  The two then go to lunch, but Nicole tells Willboughy an uninterrupted monologue on all the horrible things Hawk has done, including building a [[parking garage]] on the very same lot where [[Joe DiMaggio]] and his brothers learned to play [[baseball]]. Willoughby is upset about this and accidentally tells her that Hawk is his uncle, which enrages Nicole.  She hits him with a broiled lobster in response, sending him splashing into the waters of [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]] below.\n\nHaving become disillusioned towards his uncle, Willoughby decides to tell him face to face that he will not continue doing his dirty work. However, as he is approaching the office, he overhears his uncle threatening body harm on him for not getting in contact, so he resorts to telling him on the phone instead. Hawk flips out and shouts at his nephew, shattering the glass on the phone booth. Having lost him, Hawk decides to resort to harassment to force Mrs. Steinmetz out, the first act of which is to capture Herbie. Hawk is initially successful with his hotwiring skills, but while driving him on the street, Hawk insults the car who retaliates by causing a series of traffic collisions and jams (even going as far as barging into a police car, which causes a chain reaction of wrecks) and discards Hawk at his own office door, where Hawk orders his subordinates to capture Herbie again, followed by a policeman giving Hawk several tickets for traffic offenses. While Herbie takes Mrs. Steinmetz to market, they are chased by Hawk's men; whereupon Herbie makes several daring escapes culminating in travelling through the 1909 landmark [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Sheraton Palace Hotel]] and along a suspension cable on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], leaving Mrs. Steinmetz unfazed (and unaware) of his activity throughout.  Hawk's [[secretary]] catches sight of Herbie on the bridge, but Hawk assumes she's getting hysterical and orders her to take two aspirins and lie down.\n\nWilloughby initially tries to go home in disguise, but is convinced by Nicole to stay after she hears him criticize his uncle while talking to his mother on the telephone.  Mrs. Steinmetz asks Nicole and Willoughby to pick up some more groceries for her, and then suggests that they ought to drive to the beach.  Nicole insists that they will just go and get some [[broccoli]], which Willoughby later confesses he doesn't like, but Herbie still goes to the beach as a result of Hawk's personal [[chauffeur]] chasing him, leading Nicole to think that Mrs. Steinmetz talked him into doing it. They enjoy a nice moment at the beach, with Willoughby and Nicole falling for each other.\n\nWhile heading home, they discover that the roadway has been blocked (due to Hawk's chauffeur having bribed a man to do so), so Herbie resorts to surfing through the coastal bay to find an alternate route. On their return to the firehouse after dark, they find that every item of furniture has been removed by Hawk; whereupon Mrs. Steinmetz, Willoughby, Nicole, and Herbie track the theft to a warehouse. The four break in and recover Steinmetz's belongings, all of which had been loaded into \"No. 22.\"  Upon hearing Willoughby's voice, the orchestrion attracts their attention by playing \"[[Pomp and Circumstance]].\"  Hawk's hired security guards catch them in the act, but Herbie's acts of pushing other items off the warehouse shelves trap them and allow the trio to escape.  Mrs. Steinmetz rides in \"No. 22,\" while Willoughby and Nicole follow in Herbie.\n\nAn inebriated old-timer named Judson ([[John McIntire]]) joins Mrs Steinmetz aboard \"No. 22,\" thinking himself on a [[San Francisco cable car system|public cable car]]. Hawk pursues upon discovering the trio escaped, but Herbie distracts him and later rescues Mrs. Steinmetz and Judson from a potential crash after \"No. 22\" rolls down a hill (as well as into a building during a special [[Party#Dinner Party|dinner party]]) by getting Willoughby close enough so that he can jump aboard and use the handbrake. During this time, Mrs. Steinmetz becomes enamored with Judson (while being entirely oblivious to the fact the car is rolling down the hill).\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself. Accompanied by Willoughby in spite of Nicole telling him not to let her do this, Mrs. Steinmetz drives Herbie onto the window-cleaning machine of Hawk\u2019s skyscraper to reach his 28th-floor office (after Hawk fired his window cleaner), where they overhear a telephoned conversation with Loostgarten ([[Chuck McCann]]), an independent [[Demolition|demolition agent]], about the deal to demolish the firehouse. In response, she activates the window cleaning machine to fill the office with foam and water. This done, Herbie pursues Hawk around the building's perimeter (in response to Hawk throwing an [[ashtray]] at him) - even following him outside onto a ledge - until Mrs Steinmetz orders him to desist by mentioning a used car lot, and saying she would have to hate to call the used car man, Mr. Honest Al.\n\nDisguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby directs Loostgarten to demolish Hawk's own house. Late that evening, Loostgarten telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from several nightmares showing himself at the mercy of Herbie; Hawk then gives confirmation, but realizes too late that he has condemned his own residence, and subsequently attacks Loostgarten after a portion of his house is collapsed from a wrecking ball.\n\nIn the morning, Hawk calls a truce with Mrs. Steinmetz (as well as plant a phony story in the newspaper with the headline \"HAWK GIVES UP\"!), and thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner (to the same restaurant they were before when Nicole hit Willoughby with the broiled lobster), while Mrs. Steinmetz invites Judson to a similar meeting; in spite of this, Hawk violates the truce by sending [[Heavy equipment (construction)|earthmovers]] to crush the firehouse and its inhabitants, prompting Herbie to go in search of Nicole and Willoughby. In the absence of Herbie, the only means of defense is an antique [[fire hose]], which Judson uses against the earthmovers, until it explodes and sprays all over him.\n\nHaving obtained Nicole and Willoughby, Herbie rounds up several other Volkswagen Beetles from various places in the city (some of which leave their owners behind), and comes after Hawk and his men as an army and ruin his scheme, taking advantage of Hawk's irrational fear of Herbie. Hawk is pursued from the grounds by Herbie, and after nearly getting knocked down by a police car, Hawk is arrested after telling his bizarre tale of an army of Beetles chasing him. Later, Nicole and Willoughby are married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his new Volkswagen Beetle friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Helen Hayes]] as Mrs. Steinmetz\n* [[Ken Berry]] as Willoughby Whitfield\n* [[Stefanie Powers]] as Nicole Harris Whitfield\n* [[John McIntire]] as Mr. Judson\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Alonzo A.

This was to become worse in subsequent Herbie films as even later model cars were included.\n\nOne of the VW Beetles used in the deleted nightmare sequence (see above) was first used in ''The Love Bug'' as a stunt car during the El Dorado race (also used for interior filming).

Before specializing he served as general practitioner in rural Sweden. He sets out on a long car ride from [[Stockholm]] to [[Lund]] to be awarded the degree of [[Jubilee doctor|Doctor Jubilaris]] 50 years after he received his doctorate from [[Lund University]]. He is accompanied by his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne who does not much like her father-in-law and is planning to separate from her husband, Evald, Isak's only son, who does not want her to have the baby, their first.\n\nDuring the trip, Isak is forced by [[nightmare]]s, [[daydream]]s, [[old age]], and impending death to reevaluate his life. He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg's troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak's youth. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle has nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage.

He was misanthropic and tired and felt old. I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get him to play the part.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bj\u00f6rkman|first1=Stig|title=Bergman on Bergman|date=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=133}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Bergman on Bergman,'' he has stated that he only thought of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m when the screenplay was complete, and that he asked Dymling to contact the famous actor and film director.<ref>Bj\u00f6rkman, pg. 131</ref> Yet in ''Images: My Life in Film,'' he claims, \"It is probably worth noting that I never for a moment thought of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m when I was writing the screenplay. The suggestion came from the film's producer, Carl Anders Dymling. As I recall, I thought long and hard before I agreed to let him have the part.\"<ref>Bergman, pg. 24</ref>\n\nDuring the shooting, the health of the 79-year-old Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m gave cause for concern. Dymling had persuaded him to take on the role with the words: \"All you have to do is lie under a tree, eat wild strawberries and think about your past, so it's nothing too arduous.\" This was inaccurate and the burden of the film was completely on Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m who is in all but one scene of the film. Initially, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m had problems with his lines which made him frustrated and angry. He would go off into a corner and beat his head against the wall in frustration, even to the point of drawing blood and producing bruises. He sometimes quibbled over details in the script. To unburden his revered mentor, Bergman made a pact with [[Ingrid Thulin]] that if anything went wrong during a scene, she would take the blame on herself. Things improved when they changed filming times so that Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m could get home in time for his customary late afternoon whisky at 5:00. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m got along particularly well with [[Bibi Andersson]].<ref name=ingbergf2f/>\n\nAs usual, Bergman chose his collaborators from a team of actors and technicians with whom he had worked before in the cinema and the theater. As Sara, Bibi Andersson plays both Borg's childhood sweetheart who left him to marry his brother and a charming, energetic young woman who reminds him of that lost love. Andersson, then twenty one years old, was a member in Bergman's famed repertory company. He gave her a small part in his films ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' (1955) and as the jester's wife in ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). She would continue to work for him in many more films, most notably in ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966). [[Ingrid Thulin]] plays Marianne, the sad, gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. She appeared in other Bergman films as the mistress in ''[[Winter Light]]'' (1963) and as one of three sisters in ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1972). Bergman's first wife, Else Fisher, made a brief uncredited appearance as Borg's mother in the final flashback; their daughter, Lena, played one of Isak's twin sisters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Wild Strawberries'' received strongly positive reviews in Sweden; its acting, script, and photography were common areas of praise.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCGNAlqB0gC&pg=PA231|title=Ingmar Bergman: A Reference Guide|page=231|last=Steene|first=Birgitta|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=2005|isbn=9053564063}}</ref> It was among the films that cemented Bergman's international reputation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/141987%7C0/Wild-Strawberries.html|title=Wild Strawberries|last=Nixon|first=Rob|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> but American critics were not unanimous in their praise. A number of reviewers found its story puzzling.

In ''Stardust Memories'', the film's plot is similar in that the protagonist, filmmaker Sandy Bates (Woody Allen), is attending a viewing of his films, while reminiscing about and reflecting on his life and past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize his current ones, which are infused with flashbacks and dream sequences.  In ''Another Woman'', the film's main character, Marion Post ([[Gena Rowlands]]), is also accused by friends and relatives of being cold and unfeeling, which forces her to reexamine her life.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/another-woman-1988 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Another Woman}}</ref>  Allen also borrows several tropes from Bergman's film, such as having Lynn ([[Frances Conroy]]), Post's sister-in-law, tell her that her brother Paul ([[Harris Yulin]]) hates her and having a former student tell Post that her class changed her life. Allen has Post confront the demons of her past via several dream sequences and flashbacks that reveal important information to a viewer, as in ''Wild Strawberries''.

He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg's troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak's youth. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle has nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage. In a dream sequence, Isak is asked by Sten Alman, now the examiner, to read \"foreign\" letters on the blackboard. He cannot.

Shooting took place between July 2, 1957 and August 27, 1957.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smultronst\u00e4llet (1957) - Filming Locations|url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?itemid=4549&type=MOVIE&iv=RecordingPlace|website=Swedish Film Institute|language=Swedish}}</ref> The scenes at the summer house were filmed in [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]], a fashionable resort in the Stockholm archipelago. Part of the nightmare sequence was shot with predawn summer light in [[Gamla stan]], the old part of central Stockholm. Most of the movie was made at SF's studio and on its back lot at R\u00e5sunda in northern Stockholm.<ref name=ingbergf2f/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe director's immediate choice for the leading role of the old professor was [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]], Bergman's [[silent film]] idol and early counselor at [[AB Svensk Filmindustri|Svensk Filmindustri]], whom he had directed in ''[[To Joy (film)|To Joy]]'' eight years earlier. \"Victor,\" Bergman remarked, \"was feeling wretched and didn\u2019t want to [do it];... he must have been seventy eight. He was misanthropic and tired and felt old. I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get him to play the part.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bj\u00f6rkman|first1=Stig|title=Bergman on Bergman|date=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=133}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Bergman on Bergman,'' he has stated that he only thought of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m when the screenplay was complete, and that he asked Dymling to contact the famous actor and film director.<ref>Bj\u00f6rkman, pg. 131</ref> Yet in ''Images: My Life in Film,'' he claims, \"It is probably worth noting that I never for a moment thought of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m when I was writing the screenplay. The suggestion came from the film's producer, Carl Anders Dymling. As I recall, I thought long and hard before I agreed to let him have the part.\"<ref>Bergman, pg. 24</ref>\n\nDuring the shooting, the health of the 79-year-old Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m gave cause for concern. Dymling had persuaded him to take on the role with the words: \"All you have to do is lie under a tree, eat wild strawberries and think about your past, so it's nothing too arduous.\" This was inaccurate and the burden of the film was completely on Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m who is in all but one scene of the film. Initially, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m had problems with his lines which made him frustrated and angry. He would go off into a corner and beat his head against the wall in frustration, even to the point of drawing blood and producing bruises. He sometimes quibbled over details in the script. To unburden his revered mentor, Bergman made a pact with [[Ingrid Thulin]] that if anything went wrong during a scene, she would take the blame on herself. Things improved when they changed filming times so that Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m could get home in time for his customary late afternoon whisky at 5:00. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m got along particularly well with [[Bibi Andersson]].<ref name=ingbergf2f/>\n\nAs usual, Bergman chose his collaborators from a team of actors and technicians with whom he had worked before in the cinema and the theater. As Sara, Bibi Andersson plays both Borg's childhood sweetheart who left him to marry his brother and a charming, energetic young woman who reminds him of that lost love. Andersson, then twenty one years old, was a member in Bergman's famed repertory company. He gave her a small part in his films ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' (1955) and as the jester's wife in ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). She would continue to work for him in many more films, most notably in ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966). [[Ingrid Thulin]] plays Marianne, the sad, gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. She appeared in other Bergman films as the mistress in ''[[Winter Light]]'' (1963) and as one of three sisters in ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1972). Bergman's first wife, Else Fisher, made a brief uncredited appearance as Borg's mother in the final flashback; their daughter, Lena, played one of Isak's twin sisters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Wild Strawberries'' received strongly positive reviews in Sweden; its acting, script, and photography were common areas of praise.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCGNAlqB0gC&pg=PA231|title=Ingmar Bergman: A Reference Guide|page=231|last=Steene|first=Birgitta|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=2005|isbn=9053564063}}</ref> It was among the films that cemented Bergman's international reputation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/141987%7C0/Wild-Strawberries.html|title=Wild Strawberries|last=Nixon|first=Rob|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> but American critics were not unanimous in their praise. A number of reviewers found its story puzzling. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] lauded the performances of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Andersson but wrote, \"This one is so thoroughly mystifying that we wonder whether Mr. Bergman himself knew what he was trying to say.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D06E0DE173BEF3BBC4B51DFB0668382649EDE|title=Screen: Elusive Message; Wild Strawberries' Is a Swedish Import|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1959|accessdate=February 12, 2017}} Crowther also notes \"the English subtitles are not much help\", so some confusion was created by poor subtitles in the 1959 screening. To take just one example, in the review he states that it\u2019s unclear if the main character was a physician or a doctor, whereas in the script this is eminently clear, in fact an important scene is when the traveling party stops to refuel and the gas attendant refuses to take payment for the gasoline and extols all the good that the \u201cgood doctor\u201d has done for the community, to which the old man replies mostly to himself \"maybe I should have stayed\".</ref>\n\nIn a 1963 interview with ''Cinema'' magazine, director [[Stanley Kubrick]] listed the film as his second favourite of all time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ciment |first=Michel |title=Kubrick: Biographical Notes |year=1982 |publisher=The Kubrick Site |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/milestones.html |accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> It is now considered one of Bergman's major works. \n\nIn 2012, the work was ranked 63rd in the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b6466ce |title='Wild Strawberries' (1957) |publisher=British Film Institute}}</ref> Its screenplay was listed in ''[[Total Film]]'' as one of the 50 best ever written.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/50-best-movie-screenplays/2/|title=50 Best Movie Screenplays|last=Kinnear|first=Simon|magazine=Total Film|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThe film won the [[Golden Bear]] for Best Film at the [[8th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Berlinale 1958\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1958/03_preistr_ger_1958/03_Preistraeger_1958.html |title=Berlinale: Prize Winners |accessdate=3 January 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> \"Best Film\" and \"Best Actor\" at the [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]] and won the [[Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign Film in 1960.

In ''Stardust Memories'', the film's plot is similar in that the protagonist, filmmaker Sandy Bates (Woody Allen), is attending a viewing of his films, while reminiscing about and reflecting on his life and past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize his current ones, which are infused with flashbacks and dream sequences.  In ''Another Woman'', the film's main character, Marion Post ([[Gena Rowlands]]), is also accused by friends and relatives of being cold and unfeeling, which forces her to reexamine her life.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/another-woman-1988 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Another Woman}}</ref>  Allen also borrows several tropes from Bergman's film, such as having Lynn ([[Frances Conroy]]), Post's sister-in-law, tell her that her brother Paul ([[Harris Yulin]]) hates her and having a former student tell Post that her class changed her life. Allen has Post confront the demons of her past via several dream sequences and flashbacks that reveal important information to a viewer, as in ''Wild Strawberries''.  In ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'', Allen made reference to the scene in which Isak watches his family have dinner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefilmspectrum.com/?p=18576|title=Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) &#124; The Film Spectrum|first=Jason|last=Fraley|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref>  In ''Deconstructing Harry'', the plot (that of an academic on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university, as well as the people whom he picks up, while reflecting upon his life's experiences, with dream sequences) essentially mirrors that of ''Wild Strawberries''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Deconstructing Harry|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deconstructing-harry-1997|website=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Wild Strawberries (film)}}\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0050986|Wild Strawberries}}\n* {{Sfdb title}}\n* {{amg movie|54583|Wild Strawberries}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/186-wild-strawberries ''Wild Strawberries''] an essay by [[Peter Cowie]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* {{Allmovie title|54583|Wild Strawberries}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|wild_strawberries|Wild Strawberries}}\n\n{{Ingmar Bergman}}\n{{Golden Bear 1951-1959}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n{{Sight and Sound Poll}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1950s drama films]]\n[[Category:1957 films]]\n[[Category:Swedish black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Existentialist works]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ingmar Bergman]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ingmar Bergman]]\n[[Category:Golden Bear winners]]\n[[Category:Road movies]]\n[[Category:Swedish drama films]]\n[[Category:Swedish films]]\n[[Category:Swedish-language films]]\n[[Category:Philosophical fiction]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Erik Nordgren]]\n[[Category:Films about dreams]]\n", "name_user": "FilmLover18", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Strawberries_(film)"}

Some are governed by tradition, and others by law. Legal contract systems such as the Italian ''mezzadria'', the French ''[[m\u00e9tayage]]'', the Spanish ''mediero'', the Slavic ''po\u0142owcy'',''\u0438\u0437\u0434o\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430'' or the Islamic system of ''muqasat'', occur widely.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Overview==\nSharecropping has benefits and costs for both the owners and the tenant. Everyone encourages the cropper to remain on the land, solving the [[harvest]] rush problem{{clarify|date=April 2016}}. At the same time, since the cropper pays in shares of his harvest, owners and croppers share the risks of harvests being large or small and of prices being high or low. Because tenants benefit from larger harvests, they have an incentive to work harder and invest in better methods than in a slave plantation system. However, by dividing the working force into many individual workers, large farms no longer benefit from [[economies of scale]]. On the whole, sharecropping was not as economically efficient as the gang agriculture of slave plantations.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Larry J. Griffin|author2=Don Harrison Doyle|title=The South As an American Problem|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780820317298|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780820317298/page/168 168]|isbn=9780820317526}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., \"tenant\" farmers owned their own mules and equipment, and \"sharecroppers\" did not, and thus sharecroppers were poorer and of lower status. \nSharecropping occurred extensively in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and colonial [[Africa]], and came into wide use in the [[Southern United States]] during the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era (1865\u20131877). The South had been devastated by war \u2013 planters had ample land but little money for wages or taxes. At the same time, most of the former slaves could provide labor but had no money or land \u2013 they rejected the kind of gang labor that typified slavery. A solution was the sharecropping system focused on cotton, which was the only crop that could generate cash for the croppers, landowners, merchants and the tax collector. [[Poor White|Poor white farmers]] who previously had done little cotton farming needed cash as well and became sharecroppers.<ref name=\"Eva O 2007\">Eva O'Donovan, ''Becoming Free in the Cotton South'' (2007); Gavin Wright, ''Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy Since the Civil War'' (1986); Roger L. Ransom and David Beckham, ''One Kind of Freedom: The Economic Consequences of Emancipation'' (2nd ed. 2008)</ref>\n\nJeffery Paige made a distinction between centralized sharecropping found on cotton plantations and the decentralized sharecropping with other crops. The former is characterized by political conservatism and long lasting tenure. Tenants are tied to the landlord through the plantation store. Their work is heavily supervised as slave plantations were. This form of tenure tends to be replaced by [[wage slavery]] as markets penetrate. Decentralized sharecropping involves virtually no role for the landlord: plots are scattered, peasants manage their own labor and the landowners do not manufacture the crops. Leases are very short which leads to peasant radicalism. This form of tenure becomes more common when markets penetrate.<ref>Jeffery Paige, ''Agrarian Revolution'', page 373</ref>\n\nUse of the sharecropper system has also been identified in England<ref>Griffiths, Liz ''[http://www.bahs.org.uk/RHT/RHT%20issue%206.pdf Farming to Halves: A New Perspective on an Absurd and Miserable System]'' in Rural History Today, Issue 6:2004 p.5, accessed at British Agricultural History Society, 16 February 2013.</ref> (as the practice of \"farming to halves\"). It is still used in many rural poor areas of the world today, notably in [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].\n\nAlthough there is a perception that sharecropping was exploitative, \"evidence from around the world suggests that sharecropping is often a way for differently endowed enterprises to pool resources to mutual benefit, overcoming credit restraints and helping to manage risk.\"<ref>\n{{cite book |editor-first   = Ernest\n |editor-last    = Lutz\n |last1          = Heath\n |first1         = John\n |last2          = Binswanger\n |first2         = Hans P.\n |lastauthoramp  = y\n |title          = Agriculture and the Environment: Perspectives on Sustainable Rural Development\n |chapter        = Chapter 3: Policy-Induced Effects of Natural Resource Degradation: The Case of Colombia\n |publisher      = [[The World Bank]]\n |date           = October 1998\n |location       = [[Washington, DC]]\n |pages          = [https://archive.org/details/agricultureenvir0000unse/page/32 32]\n |chapter-url    = http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/07/24/000094946_99030406232959/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf#page=32\n |accessdate     = 2011-04-01\n |chapter-format = PDF\n |isbn           = 0-8213-4249-5\n |url            = https://archive.org/details/agricultureenvir0000unse/page/32\n}}\n</ref> According to Dr. Hunter, \"a few acres to the cottage would make the labourers too independent.\"<ref>George Roberts: \" The Social History of the People of the Southern Counties of England in past centuries.\" Lond., 1856, pp. 181-186.</ref>\n\nIt can have more than a passing similarity to [[serfdom]] or [[indentured servant|indenture]], particularly where associated with large debts at a plantation store that effectively ties down the workers and their family to the land. It has therefore been seen as an issue of [[land reform]] in contexts such as the [[Mexican Revolution]]. However, Nyambara states that Eurocentric historiographical devices such as 'feudalism' or 'slavery' often qualified by weak prefixes like 'semi-' or 'quasi-' are not helpful in understanding the antecedents and functions of sharecropping in Africa.<ref name=nyambara />\n\nSharecropping agreements can, however, be made fairly, as a form of [[tenant farming]] or [[sharefarming]] that has a variable rental payment, paid in [[arrears]]. There are three different types of contracts.<ref>Arthur F. Raper and Ira De A. Reid, ''Sharecroppers All'' (1941); Gavin Wright, ''Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy since the Civil War'' (1986).</ref>\n#Workers can rent plots of land from the owner for a certain sum and keep the whole crop.\n#Workers work on the land and earn a fixed wage from the land owner but keep some of the crop.\n#No money changes hands but the worker and land owner each keep a share of the crop.\n\nHowever, many outside factors make it efficient. One factor is slave emancipation: sharecropping provided the freed slaves of the US, Brazil and the late Roman Empire with land access.

Under this system, a planter or merchant extended a line of credit to the sharecropper while taking the year's crop as collateral. The sharecropper could then draw food and supplies all year long. When the crop was harvested, the planter or merchants who held the lien sold the harvest for the sharecropper and settled the debt.\n\n==Regions==\n\n=== Africa ===\nIn settler colonies of colonial Africa, sharecropping was a feature of the agricultural life.

The landowner provided land, housing, tools and seed, and perhaps a mule, and a local merchant provided food and supplies on credit.

Plantations and other lands throughout the South were seized by the federal government, and thousands of former slaves, known as [[freedmen]], found themselves free, yet without means to support their families. The situation was made more complex due to General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]]'s [[Special Field Orders No. 15]], which in January 1865, announced he would temporarily grant newly freed families 40 acres of land on the islands and coastal regions of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. This policy was also referred to as [[40 Acres & A Mule|Forty Acres and a Mule]]. Many believed that this policy would be extended to all former slaves and their families as repayment for their treatment at the end of the war.\n\nAn alternative path was selected and enforced. In the summer of 1865, [[President Andrew Johnson]], as one of the first acts of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], instead ordered all land under federal control be returned to the owners from whom it had been seized. This meant that plantation and land owners in the South regained their land but lacked a labor force. The solution was sharecropping, which enabled the government to match labor with demand and begin the process of economically rebuilding the nation via labor contracts.\n\nIn [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[United States]], sharecropping was one of few options for penniless [[freedmen]] to support themselves and their families. Other solutions included the [[crop-lien system]] (where the farmer was extended credit for seed and other supplies by the merchant), a rent labor system (where the former slave rents his land but keeps his entire crop), and the wage system (worker earns a fixed wage, but keeps none of their crop). Sharecropping was by far the most economically efficient, as it provided incentives for workers to produce a bigger harvest. It was a stage beyond simple hired labor because the sharecropper had an annual contract. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the federal [[Freedmen's Bureau]] ordered the arrangements<ref>{{cite book|author=Gregorie, Anne King|title=History of Sumter County, South Carolina, p. 274|publisher=Library Board of Sumter County|year=1954 }}</ref> and wrote and enforced the contracts.\n\nAfter the Civil War, plantation owners had to borrow money to farm, at around 15 percent interest. The indebtedness of cotton planters increased through the early 1940s, and the average plantation fell into bankruptcy about every 20 years. It is against this backdrop that the wealthiest owners maintained their concentrated ownership of the land.<ref>Sharecroppers All. Arthur F Raper and Ira De A. Reid. Chapell Hill 1941.

The owner provided the tools and farm animals. Farmers who owned their own mule and plow were at a higher stage, and were called [[tenant farmer]]s: They paid the landowner less, usually only a third of each crop. In both cases, the farmer kept the produce of gardens.\n\nThe sharecropper purchased seed, tools, and fertilizer, as well as food and clothing, on credit from a local merchant, or sometimes from a plantation store. At harvest time, the cropper would harvest the whole crop and sell it to the merchant who had extended credit. Purchases and the landowner's share were deducted and the cropper kept the difference\u2014or added to his debt.\n\nThough the arrangement protected sharecroppers from the negative effects of a bad crop, many sharecroppers (both black and white) remained quite poor. Arrangements typically left a third of the crop to the sharecropper.\n\nBy the early 1930s, there were 5.5 million white tenants, sharecroppers, and mixed cropping/laborers in the United States; and 3 million blacks.<ref>The Rockabilly Legends; They Called It Rockabilly Long Before they Called It Rock and Roll by Jerry Naylor and Steve Halliday DVD</ref><ref>The Devil's Music: A History of the Blues By Giles Oakley Edition: 2.

Traditional sharecropping declined after [[mechanization]] of farm work became economical in the mid-20th century. As a result, many sharecroppers were forced off the farms, and migrated to cities to work in factories, or become migrant workers in the [[Western United States]] during [[World War II]].\n\n==Sharecropping agreements==\nTypically, a sharecropping agreement would specify which party was expected to cover certain expenses, like seed, fertilizer, weed control, irrigation district assessments, and fuel. Sometimes the sharecropper covered those costs, but they expected a larger share of the crop in return. The agreement would also indicate whether the sharecropper would use his own equipment to raise the crops, or use the landlord's equipment. The agreement would also indicate whether the landlord would pick up his or her share of the crop in the field or whether the sharecropper would deliver it (and where it would be delivered.)\n\nFor example, a landowner may have a sharecropper farming an irrigated hayfield. The sharecropper uses his own equipment, and covers all the costs of fuel and fertilizer. The landowner pays the irrigation district assessments and does the irrigating himself. The sharecropper cuts and bales the hay, and delivers one-third of the baled hay to the landlord's feedlot. The sharecropper might also leave the landlord's share of the baled hay in the field, where the landlord would fetch it when he wanted hay.\n\nAnother arrangement could have the sharecropper delivering the landlord's share of the product to market, in which case the landlord would get his share in the form of the sale proceeds. In that case, the agreement should indicate the timing of the delivery to market, which can have a significant effect on the ultimate price of some crops. The [[market timing]] decision should probably be decided shortly before harvest, so that the landlord has more complete information about the area's harvest, to determine whether the crop will earn more money immediately after harvest, or whether it should be stored until the price rises. Market timing can entail storage costs and losses to spoilage for some crops as well.\n\n==Farmers' cooperatives==\n{{Main|Agricultural cooperative}}\n[[Cooperative farming]] exists in many forms throughout the United States, [[Canada]], and the rest of the world. Various arrangements can be made through collective bargaining or purchasing to get the best deals on seeds, supplies, and equipment. For example, members of a farmers' cooperative who cannot afford heavy equipment of their own can lease them for nominal fees from the cooperative. Farmers' cooperatives can also allow groups of small farmers and dairymen to manage pricing and prevent undercutting by competitors.\n\n==Economic theories of share tenancy==\n\nThe theory of share tenancy was long dominated by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s famous footnote in Book VI, Chapter X.14 of [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|''Principles'']]<ref>{{cite book|author1=Alfred Marshall|title=Principles of Economics|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html|year=1920|edition=8th|\npublisher=London: Macmillan and Co., Ltd}}</ref> where he illustrated the inefficiency of agricultural share-contracting.

Some are governed by tradition, and others by law. Legal contract systems such as the Italian ''mezzadria'', the French ''[[m\u00e9tayage]]'', the Spanish ''mediero'', the Slavic ''po\u0142owcy'',''\u0438\u0437\u0434o\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430'' or the Islamic system of ''muqasat'', occur widely.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Overview==\nSharecropping has benefits and costs for both the owners and the tenant. Everyone encourages the cropper to remain on the land, solving the [[harvest]] rush problem{{clarify|date=April 2016}}. At the same time, since the cropper pays in shares of his harvest, owners and croppers share the risks of harvests being large or small and of prices being high or low. Because tenants benefit from larger harvests, they have an incentive to work harder and invest in better methods than in a slave plantation system. However, by dividing the working force into many individual workers, large farms no longer benefit from [[economies of scale]]. On the whole, sharecropping was not as economically efficient as the gang agriculture of slave plantations.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Larry J.

The South had been devastated by war \u2013 planters had ample land but little money for wages or taxes. At the same time, most of the former slaves could provide labor but had no money or land \u2013 they rejected the kind of gang labor that typified slavery. A solution was the sharecropping system focused on cotton, which was the only crop that could generate cash for the croppers, landowners, merchants and the tax collector. [[Poor White|Poor white farmers]] who previously had done little cotton farming needed cash as well and became sharecroppers.<ref name=\"Eva O 2007\">Eva O'Donovan, ''Becoming Free in the Cotton South'' (2007); Gavin Wright, ''Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy Since the Civil War'' (1986); Roger L. Ransom and David Beckham, ''One Kind of Freedom: The Economic Consequences of Emancipation'' (2nd ed. 2008)</ref>\n\nJeffery Paige made a distinction between centralized sharecropping found on cotton plantations and the decentralized sharecropping with other crops. The former is characterized by political conservatism and long lasting tenure. Tenants are tied to the landlord through the plantation store. Their work is heavily supervised as slave plantations were. This form of tenure tends to be replaced by [[wage slavery]] as markets penetrate. Decentralized sharecropping involves virtually no role for the landlord: plots are scattered, peasants manage their own labor and the landowners do not manufacture the crops. Leases are very short which leads to peasant radicalism. This form of tenure becomes more common when markets penetrate.<ref>Jeffery Paige, ''Agrarian Revolution'', page 373</ref>\n\nUse of the sharecropper system has also been identified in England<ref>Griffiths, Liz ''[http://www.bahs.org.uk/RHT/RHT%20issue%206.pdf Farming to Halves: A New Perspective on an Absurd and Miserable System]'' in Rural History Today, Issue 6:2004 p.5, accessed at British Agricultural History Society, 16 February 2013.</ref> (as the practice of \"farming to halves\"). It is still used in many rural poor areas of the world today, notably in [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].\n\nAlthough there is a perception that sharecropping was exploitative, \"evidence from around the world suggests that sharecropping is often a way for differently endowed enterprises to pool resources to mutual benefit, overcoming credit restraints and helping to manage risk.\"<ref>\n{{cite book |editor-first   = Ernest\n |editor-last    = Lutz\n |last1          = Heath\n |first1         = John\n |last2          = Binswanger\n |first2         = Hans P.\n |lastauthoramp  = y\n |title          = Agriculture and the Environment: Perspectives on Sustainable Rural Development\n |chapter        = Chapter 3: Policy-Induced Effects of Natural Resource Degradation: The Case of Colombia\n |publisher      = [[The World Bank]]\n |date           = October 1998\n |location       = [[Washington, DC]]\n |pages          = [https://archive.org/details/agricultureenvir0000unse/page/32 32]\n |chapter-url    = http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/07/24/000094946_99030406232959/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf#page=32\n |accessdate     = 2011-04-01\n |chapter-format = PDF\n |isbn           = 0-8213-4249-5\n |url            = https://archive.org/details/agricultureenvir0000unse/page/32\n}}\n</ref> According to Dr. Hunter, \"a few acres to the cottage would make the labourers too independent.\"<ref>George Roberts: \" The Social History of the People of the Southern Counties of England in past centuries.\" Lond., 1856, pp. 181-186.</ref>\n\nIt can have more than a passing similarity to [[serfdom]] or [[indentured servant|indenture]], particularly where associated with large debts at a plantation store that effectively ties down the workers and their family to the land. It has therefore been seen as an issue of [[land reform]] in contexts such as the [[Mexican Revolution]]. However, Nyambara states that Eurocentric historiographical devices such as 'feudalism' or 'slavery' often qualified by weak prefixes like 'semi-' or 'quasi-' are not helpful in understanding the antecedents and functions of sharecropping in Africa.<ref name=nyambara />\n\nSharecropping agreements can, however, be made fairly, as a form of [[tenant farming]] or [[sharefarming]] that has a variable rental payment, paid in [[arrears]]. There are three different types of contracts.<ref>Arthur F. Raper and Ira De A. Reid, ''Sharecroppers All'' (1941); Gavin Wright, ''Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy since the Civil War'' (1986).</ref>\n#Workers can rent plots of land from the owner for a certain sum and keep the whole crop.\n#Workers work on the land and earn a fixed wage from the land owner but keep some of the crop.\n#No money changes hands but the worker and land owner each keep a share of the crop.\n\nHowever, many outside factors make it efficient. One factor is slave emancipation: sharecropping provided the freed slaves of the US, Brazil and the late Roman Empire with land access. It is efficient also as a way of escaping inflation, hence its rise in 16th-century France and Italy.<ref name=\"tjbyres\">Sharecropping and Sharecroppers, T J Byres</ref>\n\nIt also gave sharecroppers a vested interest in the land, incentivizing hard work and care. American plantation were, however, wary of this interest, as they felt that would lead to African Americans demanding rights of partnership. Many black laborers denied the unilateral authority that landowners hoped to achieve, further complicating relations between landowners and sharecroppers.<ref name=\"Temple University Press\">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14bt3nz.9|title=The Origins of Southern Sharecropping|date=1993|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781566390699|editor-last=Royce|editor-first=Edward|pages=181\u2013222|last1=Royce|first1=Edward|chapter=The Rise of Southern Sharecropping}}</ref>\n\nLandlords opt for sharecropping to avoid the administrative costs and [[Efficiency wage|shirking]] that occurs on plantations and [[hacienda]]s. It is preferred to cash tenancy because cash tenants take all the risks, and any [[harvest failure]] will hurt them and not the landlord. Therefore, they tend to demand lower rents than sharecroppers.<ref name=\"tjbyres\"/>\n\nThe advantages of sharecropping in other situations include enabling access for women<ref>Bruce, John W.- ''Country Profiles of Land Tenure: Africa, 1996'' (Lesotho, p. 221) Research Paper No. 130, December 1998, Land Tenure Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison accessed at [http://agecon.lib.umn.edu/cgi-bin/pdf_view.pl?paperid=1153&ftype=.pdf UMN.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011125185519/http://agecon.lib.umn.edu/cgi-bin/pdf_view.pl?paperid=1153 |date=2001-11-25 }} June 19, 2006</ref> to [[arable land]] where ownership rights are vested only in men.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nThe practice was harmful to tenants with many cases of high interest rates, unpredictable harvests, and unscrupulous landlords and merchants often keeping tenant farm families severely indebted.

Under this system, a planter or merchant extended a line of credit to the sharecropper while taking the year's crop as collateral. The sharecropper could then draw food and supplies all year long. When the crop was harvested, the planter or merchants who held the lien sold the harvest for the sharecropper and settled the debt.\n\n==Regions==\n\n=== Africa ===\nIn settler colonies of colonial Africa, sharecropping was a feature of the agricultural life. White farmers, who owned most of the land, were frequently unable to work the whole of their farm for lack of capital.

The landowner provided land, housing, tools and seed, and perhaps a mule, and a local merchant provided food and supplies on credit. At harvest time, the sharecropper received a share of the crop (from one-third to one-half, with the landowner taking the rest).

By the 1880s, white farmers also became sharecroppers. The system was distinct from that of the tenant farmer, who rented the land, provided his own tools and mule, and received half the crop.

Plantations and other lands throughout the South were seized by the federal government, and thousands of former slaves, known as [[freedmen]], found themselves free, yet without means to support their families. The situation was made more complex due to General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]]'s [[Special Field Orders No. 15]], which in January 1865, announced he would temporarily grant newly freed families 40 acres of land on the islands and coastal regions of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. This policy was also referred to as [[40 Acres & A Mule|Forty Acres and a Mule]]. Many believed that this policy would be extended to all former slaves and their families as repayment for their treatment at the end of the war.\n\nAn alternative path was selected and enforced. In the summer of 1865, [[President Andrew Johnson]], as one of the first acts of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], instead ordered all land under federal control be returned to the owners from whom it had been seized. This meant that plantation and land owners in the South regained their land but lacked a labor force. The solution was sharecropping, which enabled the government to match labor with demand and begin the process of economically rebuilding the nation via labor contracts.\n\nIn [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[United States]], sharecropping was one of few options for penniless [[freedmen]] to support themselves and their families. Other solutions included the [[crop-lien system]] (where the farmer was extended credit for seed and other supplies by the merchant), a rent labor system (where the former slave rents his land but keeps his entire crop), and the wage system (worker earns a fixed wage, but keeps none of their crop). Sharecropping was by far the most economically efficient, as it provided incentives for workers to produce a bigger harvest. It was a stage beyond simple hired labor because the sharecropper had an annual contract. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the federal [[Freedmen's Bureau]] ordered the arrangements<ref>{{cite book|author=Gregorie, Anne King|title=History of Sumter County, South Carolina, p. 274|publisher=Library Board of Sumter County|year=1954 }}</ref> and wrote and enforced the contracts.\n\nAfter the Civil War, plantation owners had to borrow money to farm, at around 15 percent interest. The indebtedness of cotton planters increased through the early 1940s, and the average plantation fell into bankruptcy about every 20 years. It is against this backdrop that the wealthiest owners maintained their concentrated ownership of the land.<ref>Sharecroppers All. Arthur F Raper and Ira De A. Reid. Chapell Hill 1941.

The owner provided the tools and farm animals. Farmers who owned their own mule and plow were at a higher stage, and were called [[tenant farmer]]s: They paid the landowner less, usually only a third of each crop. In both cases, the farmer kept the produce of gardens.\n\nThe sharecropper purchased seed, tools, and fertilizer, as well as food and clothing, on credit from a local merchant, or sometimes from a plantation store. At harvest time, the cropper would harvest the whole crop and sell it to the merchant who had extended credit. Purchases and the landowner's share were deducted and the cropper kept the difference\u2014or added to his debt.\n\nThough the arrangement protected sharecroppers from the negative effects of a bad crop, many sharecroppers (both black and white) remained quite poor. Arrangements typically left a third of the crop to the sharecropper.\n\nBy the early 1930s, there were 5.5 million white tenants, sharecroppers, and mixed cropping/laborers in the United States; and 3 million blacks.<ref>The Rockabilly Legends; They Called It Rockabilly Long Before they Called It Rock and Roll by Jerry Naylor and Steve Halliday DVD</ref><ref>The Devil's Music: A History of the Blues By Giles Oakley Edition: 2.

Traditional sharecropping declined after [[mechanization]] of farm work became economical in the mid-20th century. As a result, many sharecroppers were forced off the farms, and migrated to cities to work in factories, or become migrant workers in the [[Western United States]] during [[World War II]].\n\n==Sharecropping agreements==\nTypically, a sharecropping agreement would specify which party was expected to cover certain expenses, like seed, fertilizer, weed control, irrigation district assessments, and fuel. Sometimes the sharecropper covered those costs, but they expected a larger share of the crop in return. The agreement would also indicate whether the sharecropper would use his own equipment to raise the crops, or use the landlord's equipment. The agreement would also indicate whether the landlord would pick up his or her share of the crop in the field or whether the sharecropper would deliver it (and where it would be delivered.)\n\nFor example, a landowner may have a sharecropper farming an irrigated hayfield. The sharecropper uses his own equipment, and covers all the costs of fuel and fertilizer. The landowner pays the irrigation district assessments and does the irrigating himself. The sharecropper cuts and bales the hay, and delivers one-third of the baled hay to the landlord's feedlot. The sharecropper might also leave the landlord's share of the baled hay in the field, where the landlord would fetch it when he wanted hay.\n\nAnother arrangement could have the sharecropper delivering the landlord's share of the product to market, in which case the landlord would get his share in the form of the sale proceeds. In that case, the agreement should indicate the timing of the delivery to market, which can have a significant effect on the ultimate price of some crops. The [[market timing]] decision should probably be decided shortly before harvest, so that the landlord has more complete information about the area's harvest, to determine whether the crop will earn more money immediately after harvest, or whether it should be stored until the price rises. Market timing can entail storage costs and losses to spoilage for some crops as well.\n\n==Farmers' cooperatives==\n{{Main|Agricultural cooperative}}\n[[Cooperative farming]] exists in many forms throughout the United States, [[Canada]], and the rest of the world. Various arrangements can be made through collective bargaining or purchasing to get the best deals on seeds, supplies, and equipment. For example, members of a farmers' cooperative who cannot afford heavy equipment of their own can lease them for nominal fees from the cooperative. Farmers' cooperatives can also allow groups of small farmers and dairymen to manage pricing and prevent undercutting by competitors.\n\n==Economic theories of share tenancy==\n\nThe theory of share tenancy was long dominated by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s famous footnote in Book VI, Chapter X.14 of [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|''Principles'']]<ref>{{cite book|author1=Alfred Marshall|title=Principles of Economics|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html|year=1920|edition=8th|\npublisher=London: Macmillan and Co., Ltd}}</ref> where he illustrated the inefficiency of agricultural share-contracting.

He began playing football on the streets just like many other football stars, usually with a makeshift ball.\n\nIn an interview with [[BBC Sport]] he said, \"As far as I can remember, we used to play with anything, with any round thing we could find, and whenever we managed to get hold of a ball, that was a bonus!

In his time at the club he produced many spectacular displays including one where he rounded off and scored a goal, against experienced Nigerian goalkeeper [[William Okpara]] in a match against [[BCC Lions]]. Later that year, he went on holiday to West Germany, the country that had just won the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], so he could watch German league football. His friend Binebi Numa was playing in the Third Division for [[Borussia Neunkirchen]], and one morning Okocha accompanied Numa to training, where he asked to join in.

As captain he led Bolton to their first cup final in nine years where they finished runners-up in the 2004 [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].\n\nIn 2006, he was stripped of the captaincy \u2013 something he said he had seen coming, as there had been a change in attitude from some staff members.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} This had probably been due to his proposed move to the Middle East, which had been growing in speculation. At the end of the season, he refused a one-year extension in order to move to [[Qatar]].\n\nFollowing Bolton's relegation from the Premier League in 2012, Okocha stated that his time at the club was now rendered a waste of time, because the club had not invested and improved on the foundations that were laid during his time there.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/9726365.Jay_Jay_drops_a_bombshell/ | title = Jay Jay drops a bombshell | publisher = The Bolton News | date = 25 May 2012 | accessdate = 13 October 2012 | first = Marc | last = Iles}}</ref>\n\n===Hull City===\nAfter just one season in Qatar, [[Football League Championship]] side [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] signed Okocha on a free transfer in 2007, after the player had been linked to [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Sydney FC]]. It was a move he made saying that \"God had told him to do so\". He however was not able to contribute greatly to Hull's promotion campaign due to fitness and constant injury problems, playing only 18 games and scoring no goals. Hull still succeeded in winning promotion to the [[Premier League]], for the first time in their 104-year history. At the end of the season, after changing his mind on a proposed retirement due to Hull's promotion, he was released by the club, which ultimately sent him into retirement.\n\n==International career==\nOkocha made his official debut for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in their 2\u20131 [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] Qualifier away loss against [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] in May 1993. It was not until his second cap and home debut that he became a favourite with the Nigerian supporters. With Nigeria trailing 1\u20130 against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in a match they needed to win, he scored from a direct free kick to equalise, before helping the team to a 4\u20131 win, eventually securing qualification to their first World Cup. In 1994, he was a member of both the victorious [[1994 African Cup of Nations]] squad.<ref>[[1994 Africa Cup of Nations squads #Nigeria]]</ref><ref>[[1994 Africa Cup of Nations #Caf Team of Tournament]]</ref> And the World Cup squad who made it to the second round before they lost in a dramatic match against eventual runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]].\n\nIn 1996, Okocha became a key member of an arguably more successful Nigerian side, their [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold winning side at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Games]], later nicknamed the Dream Team by the Nigerian press after the USA 1992 Olympic gold winning basketball team. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by France, Okocha played for a disappointing Super Eagles side who failed to live up to expectations again reaching the round of 16, albeit with less impressive performances save for their 3\u20132 opening win against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

In his time at the club he produced many spectacular displays including one where he rounded off and scored a goal, against experienced Nigerian goalkeeper [[William Okpara]] in a match against [[BCC Lions]]. Later that year, he went on holiday to West Germany, the country that had just won the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], so he could watch German league football. His friend Binebi Numa was playing in the Third Division for [[Borussia Neunkirchen]], and one morning Okocha accompanied Numa to training, where he asked to join in. The Neunkirchen coach was impressed with Okocha's skills and invited him back the next day before offering him a contract.<ref name=\"fourfourtwo\">{{cite journal |last1=Massarella |first1=Louis |date=September 2004 |editor1-last=Sleight |editor1-first=Hugh |title=So good they named him twice |journal=[[FourFourTwo]] |location=Teddington |publisher=Haymarket Magazines |issue=121 |pages=72\u20136 |issn=1355-0276 }}</ref> A year later, he joined [[1.

At the end of the season, he refused a one-year extension in order to move to [[Qatar]].\n\nFollowing Bolton's relegation from the Premier League in 2012, Okocha stated that his time at the club was now rendered a waste of time, because the club had not invested and improved on the foundations that were laid during his time there.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/9726365.Jay_Jay_drops_a_bombshell/ | title = Jay Jay drops a bombshell | publisher = The Bolton News | date = 25 May 2012 | accessdate = 13 October 2012 | first = Marc | last = Iles}}</ref>\n\n===Hull City===\nAfter just one season in Qatar, [[Football League Championship]] side [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] signed Okocha on a free transfer in 2007, after the player had been linked to [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Sydney FC]]. It was a move he made saying that \"God had told him to do so\". He however was not able to contribute greatly to Hull's promotion campaign due to fitness and constant injury problems, playing only 18 games and scoring no goals. Hull still succeeded in winning promotion to the [[Premier League]], for the first time in their 104-year history. At the end of the season, after changing his mind on a proposed retirement due to Hull's promotion, he was released by the club, which ultimately sent him into retirement.\n\n==International career==\nOkocha made his official debut for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in their 2\u20131 [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] Qualifier away loss against [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] in May 1993. It was not until his second cap and home debut that he became a favourite with the Nigerian supporters. With Nigeria trailing 1\u20130 against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in a match they needed to win, he scored from a direct free kick to equalise, before helping the team to a 4\u20131 win, eventually securing qualification to their first World Cup. In 1994, he was a member of both the victorious [[1994 African Cup of Nations]] squad.<ref>[[1994 Africa Cup of Nations squads #Nigeria]]</ref><ref>[[1994 Africa Cup of Nations #Caf Team of Tournament]]</ref> And the World Cup squad who made it to the second round before they lost in a dramatic match against eventual runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]].\n\nIn 1996, Okocha became a key member of an arguably more successful Nigerian side, their [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold winning side at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Games]], later nicknamed the Dream Team by the Nigerian press after the USA 1992 Olympic gold winning basketball team. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by France, Okocha played for a disappointing Super Eagles side who failed to live up to expectations again reaching the round of 16, albeit with less impressive performances save for their 3\u20132 opening win against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

It was based on the 1961 book ''Car, Boy, Girl'' by Gordon Buford.\n\nThe movie follows the adventures of Herbie, Herbie's driver, Jim Douglas ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), and Jim's [[Romantic interest|love interest]], Carole Bennett ([[Michele Lee]]). It also features [[Buddy Hackett]] as Jim's enlightened, kind-hearted friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, a character who creates \"art\" from used car parts. English actor [[David Tomlinson]] portrays the villainous Peter Thorndyke, (familiar from his role as Mr. George Banks in ''[[Mary Poppins (1964 film)|Mary Poppins]]'') the owner of an [[automobile|auto]] [[showroom]] and an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] national champion who sells Herbie to Jim and eventually becomes his racing rival.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1968, Jim Douglas is a miserable [[racing driver]], reduced to competing in [[demolition derby]] races against drivers half his age. Jim lives in an old [[fire house]] overlooking [[San Francisco Bay]] with his friend and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz, a jolly Brooklynite who constantly extols the virtues of [[spiritual enlightenment]], having spent time amongst [[Buddhist monks]] in [[Tibet]], and builds \"art\" from car parts. After yet another race ends in a crash (and Tennessee turns his [[Edsel]] into a sculpture), Jim finds himself without a car and heads into town in search of some cheap wheels. He is enticed into an upmarket European car showroom after setting eyes on an attractive sales assistant and mechanic, Carole Bennett. Jim witnesses the dealership's British owner, Peter Thorndyke, being unnecessarily abusive towards a white [[Volkswagen Beetle]] that rolls into the showroom, and defends the car's honor, much to Thorndyke's displeasure. The following morning, Jim is shocked to find that the car is parked outside his house and that Thorndyke is pressing charges for [[motor vehicle theft|grand theft]]. A heated argument between Jim and Thorndyke is settled when Carole persuades Thorndyke to drop the charges if Jim purchases the car on a system of monthly payments.\n\nJim soon finds that the car is prone to going completely out of his control and believes Thorndyke has conned him. Tennessee, however, believes certain inanimate objects to have hearts and minds of their own and tries to befriend the car, naming it [[Herbie]]. Jim's feelings about his new acquisition soon improve when it appears that Herbie is intent on bringing him and Carole together. He also discovers Herbie to have an incredible turn of speed for a car of his size and decides to take him [[motor racing|racing]]. After watching Jim and Herbie win their first race together, Thorndyke, himself a major force on the local racing scene, offers to cancel the remaining payments Jim owes on Herbie if Jim can win a race that they will both be competing in at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] later that month. Jim accepts, and despite Thorndyke's underhanded tactics, he and Herbie take the victory. Over the next few months, they go on to become the toast of the Californian racing circuit, while Thorndyke suffers increasingly humiliating defeats. Thorndyke finally loses his composure and persuades Carole to take Jim out on a date while he sneaks round to Jim's house. After Tennessee gets drunk on his own [[Irish coffee]] recipe, Thorndyke proceeds to tip the remainder of the alcoholic coffee and whipped cream into Herbie's gas tank. At the following day's race, an apparently hungover Herbie shudders to a halt and backfires while Thorndyke blasts to victory. However, as the crowd admires Thorndyke's victory, Herbie blows some whipped cream out of his exhaust pipe, covering Thorndyke.\n\nThat evening, Carole comes to Jim's house to help Tennessee repair Herbie. Carole then hears the whole truth about Herbie having a mind of his own and having a great speed for winning races instead of Jim. Jim returns home in a brand new [[Lamborghini 400GT]], and has agreed to sell Herbie to Thorndyke to pay the remaining installments that he owes on it. Jim states his need for a \"big and strong car\" to drive in the upcoming El Dorado [[road racing|road race]], but finds no sympathy from Tennessee or Carole. Carole also angrily confronts Jim to make him realize that he did not care about Herbie and that he was not winning any of the races he participated in after hearing what Tennessee said to her, and she believed him. Jim also doesn't get sympathy from Herbie who proceeds to damage the Lamborghini, and this angers Jim, causing him to damage Herbie with a shovel. Tennessee tries to stop Jim and says that Herbie was jealous and Jim agrees because he gets the credit for winning races. By the moment he says this, it really does makes him realize that Herbie has a mind of his own. By the time Thorndyke arrives to collect Herbie, Jim refuses the money from him and then sees that Herbie has run away. Jim sets off into the night hoping to find Herbie and make amends before the car is seized by Thorndyke's goons. After narrowly escaping being torn apart in Thorndyke's workshop, and a destructive spree through [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], during the Chinese New Year's parade, Herbie is about to [[Suicide|launch himself]] off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] when Jim reaches him. In his attempt to stop Herbie from driving off the bridge, Jim nearly falls into the water. Herbie pulls Jim back to safety after seeing that it is Jim and that he does care about him, but is then impounded by the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. There, Tang Wu, ([[Benson Fong]]) a Chinese businessman whose store was damaged during Herbie's rampage, demands [[Damages|compensation]] that Jim can no longer afford. Using the Chinese language he had learned while in Tibet, Tennessee tries to reason with Wu, and learns that he is a huge racing fan who knows all about Jim and Herbie's exploits. Wu is willing to drop the charges in exchange for becoming Herbie's new owner. Jim agrees to this, as long as Wu allows him to race the car in the El Dorado. If Jim wins, Wu will be able to keep the prize money, but will then be required to sell Herbie back for one [[US dollar|dollar]]. Wu replies to this proposal in clear English: \"Now you speak my language.\"\n[[File:Herbie the Matchmaker.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dean Jones in ''The Love Bug'']]\n\nThe El Dorado runs through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains from [[Yosemite Valley]] to [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and back. Before the start of the race, Thorndyke persuades Wu to make a wager with him on its outcome. Thorndyke (with his assistant Havershaw acting as [[co-driver]]) initiates every trick known to man to ensure that he and his Thorndyke Special are leading at end of the first leg of the race. As a result of Thorndyke's shenanigans, Jim (with Carole and Tennessee as co-drivers) limps home last with Herbie missing two wheels and having to use a wagon wheel to get to the finish line. Despite Tennessee's best efforts, it looks as if Herbie will be unable to start the return leg of the race the following morning. Thorndyke then arrives and claims that this makes him the new owner of the car. Wu regretfully tells Jim of the wager and that in accordance with its terms this is true. Thorndyke, thinking he is Herbie's new owner, gloats to Jim about what he is going to do to Herbie and kicks Herbie's front fender, and punches Jim, but Herbie then unexpectedly lurches into life and chases Thorndyke from the scene, showing that he is more than willing to race on. Thanks to some ingenious shortcuts, Jim is able to make up for lost time in the second leg and is neck and neck with Thorndyke as they approach the finish line. In the ensuing dogfight, Herbie's hastily [[welding|welded]]-together body splits in two. The back half (carrying Tennessee and the engine) crosses the line just ahead of Thorndyke, while the front (carrying Jim and Carole) rolls over the line just behind, meaning Herbie takes both first ''and'' third place.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the wager, Wu takes over Thorndyke's car dealership (hiring Tennessee as his assistant), while Thorndyke and Havershaw are relegated to lowly mechanics. Meanwhile, a fully repaired Herbie chauffeurs the newlywed Jim and Carole away on their honeymoon.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Jim Douglas, a racing driver\n*[[Michele Lee]] as Carole Bennet, Jim's love interest\n*[[David Tomlinson]] as Peter Thorndyke, the owner of the car shop \n*[[Buddy Hackett]] as Tennessee Steinmetz, Jim's friend and roommate and partner in racing\n*[[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] as Havershaw, Thorndyke's right-hand man\n*[[Benson Fong]] as Tang Wu, Jim's friend and team supporter\n*[[Joe E.

Although Jones tried to pitch him a serious, straightforward film project concerning the story of the first [[sports car]] ever brought to the United States, Walt suggested a different car story for him, which was ''Car, Boy, Girl'', a story written in 1961 by Gordon Buford.\n\n''Car, Boy, Girl;'' ''The Magic Volksy;'' ''The Runaway Wagen;'' ''Beetlebomb;'' ''Wonderbeetle;'' ''Bugboom'' and ''Thunderbug'' were among the original development titles considered for the film before the title was finalized as ''The Love Bug.''\n\nHerbie competes in the [[Monterey Grand Prix]], which, except for 1963, was not a sports car race. The actual sports car race held at Monterey was the [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]]. The 1968 Monterey Grand Prix was in fact a [[Can Am Series]] race, and did not feature production cars.\n\nPeter Thorndyke's yellow \"Special\" is actually a 1965 [[Apollo (1962 automobile)|Apollo GT]], a rare sports car built in the United States by International Motorcars in [[Oakland, California]]. It used an Italian-designed body along with a small-block [[Buick V8 engine|Buick]] V8 engine. This car exists today, is in the hands of a private collector, and has been restored as it was seen in the film with its yellow paint and number 14 logo.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Thorndyke Special|url=http://barnfinds.com/thorndyke-special/|website=Barnfinds.com}}</ref>\n\n===\"Herbie\"===\n[[File:Herbie film car from The Love Bug.jpg|left|thumb|One of the original cars used during the filming of ''The Love Bug'']]\nBefore film began production, the titular car was not specified as a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and Disney set up a casting call for a dozen cars to audition. In the lineup, there were a few [[Toyota]]s, a [[TVR]], a handful of [[Volvo]]s, an [[MG Cars|MG]] and a pearl white Volkswagen Beetle. The Volkswagen Beetle was chosen as it was the only one that elicited the crew to reach out and pet it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Volkswagen brand name, logo or shield does not feature anywhere in the film, as the automaker did not permit Disney to use the name. The only logos can be briefly seen in at least two places, however. The first instance is on the brake pedals during the first scene where Herbie takes control with Jim inside (on the freeway when Herbie runs into Thorndyke's Rolls Royce), and it is shown in all the future scenes when Jim is braking. The second instance is on the ignition key, when Jim tries to shut down the braking Herbie. The later sequels produced, however, do promote the Volkswagen name (as sales of the Beetle were down when the sequels were produced). The VW \"[[Wolfsburg]]\" castle emblem on the steering wheel hub is also seen throughout the car's interior shots. Within the script, the car was only ever referred to as \"Herbie\", \"the small car\" or \"the Bug\"\u2014the latter, although a common nickname for the Beetle, was not trademarked by Volkswagen at the time of filming.\n\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Align = Right\n|Image = LAret53.PNG\n|Name = Donald Drysdale\n|Number = 53\n|Team = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|Year = 1984\n}}\n\nThe car was later given the name \"Herbie\" from one of [[Buddy Hackett]]'s [[Sketch comedy|skit]]s about a ski instructor named Klaus, who speaks with a German accent as he introduces his fellow ski instructors, who are named Hans, Fritz, Wilhelm, and Sandor. At the end of the skit, Hackett would say \"If you ain't got a Herbie (pronounced \"''hoy-bee''{{-\"}}), I ain't going.\"\n\nHerbie's trademark \"53\" racing number was chosen by producer [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], who was a fan of [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball player [[Don Drysdale]] (Drysdale's jersey number, later retired by the team, was 53).\n\nWalsh also gave Herbie his trademark red, white and blue [[racing stripe]]s presumably for the more [[patriotic]] color and came up with the film's gags such as Herbie squirting oil and opening the doors by himself.<ref>DVD commentary, ''The Love Bug'', 2003</ref>\n\nBenson Fong, who played Mr. Wu, said that when he and the others were dragged along the dirt by Herbie, it was like being pulled by 40 horses. The 1961\u20131965 Volkswagen Beetles actually were rated by the [[SAE International|SAE]] at {{convert|40|hp}} in factory configuration (though only {{convert|34|hp}} by the European [[DIN]] system which measured engine output as installed in the car with cooling fan and exhaust system attached).\n\nHerbie has his own cast billing in the closing credits, the only time this was done in the entire series of films.\n\nToday, only a handful of the original Herbie cars are known to exist. Car #10 was recovered from a warehouse in Pennsylvania, and has been preserved\u2014still sporting its original paint from the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Love Bug Reunion|url=http://barnfinds.com/love-bug-reunion/|website=Barnfinds.com}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nThe bonuses on the DVD provide two deleted scenes named \"Used Car Lot\" and \"Playground\".\n\nA scene shot, but not included in the final cut of the film, featured Jim calling at a [[Car dealership|used car lot]] prior to his visiting Thorndyke's auto showroom. This missing sequence has long since been lost, and all that remains is the [[Screenplay|script]] and a single [[black-and-white]] photograph of Jim talking with the salesman at the lot.\n\nAn unfilmed scene at the end of the story that was scripted and [[storyboard]]ed was to have shown Herbie playing with children at a nearby [[playground]] prior to taking the newly married Jim and Carole off on their honeymoon.\n\n===Stock footage===\nThe opening scene of the [[demolition derby]] cars is [[stock footage|footage]] from the film ''[[Fireball 500]].'' Parts of this scene can also be found in a 1966-model year dealer promotional film by Chevrolet, titled ''Impact '66''.\n\n===Shooting locations===\nSome of the racetrack scenes were shot at the [[Riverside International Raceway]] in [[Riverside, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Sam|title=Shelby, American|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=May 2014|volume=65|issue=8|page=65}}</ref> Others were filmed at [[Laguna Seca Raceway]] in [[Monterey, California]], [[Willow Springs Raceway]] in [[Willow Springs, Kern County, California|Willow Springs, California]] and [[Paramount Ranch Racetrack|Paramount Ranch]] in [[Agoura Hills, California]]. Additional scenes depicting the El Dorado race were filmed near the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] in [[Big Bear City, California]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Love Bug: The Missing Eldorado Locations + 1|url=https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/lovebugfans/viewtopic.php?p=63882&sid=f24a998c6093be74d1815e178590a9db#p63882}}</ref>\n\n===Cast and crew===\n[[Andy Granatelli]], who was popular at the time as a presence at the [[Indianapolis 500]] as well as the spokesman for [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]], appears as himself as the racing association president. Announcer [[Gary Owens]] (of ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' fame) and reporter [[Chick Hearn]] also appear as themselves. The driving scenes were choreographed by veteran stunt man Carey Loftin.\n\nDrivers in the film billed in the opening credits include [[Dale Van Sickel]], Reg Parton, Regina Parton, [[Tom Bamford]], [[Bob Drake (racing driver)|Bob Drake]], Marion J. Playan, Hall Brock, [[Bill Hickman]], Rex Ramsay, Hal Grist, Lynn Grate, Larry Schmitz, Richard Warlock, Dana Derfus, Everett Creach, Gerald Jann, Bill Couch, Ted Duncan, Robert Hoys, Gene Roscoe, Jack Mahoney, Charles Willis, Richard Brill, Roy Butterfield, Rudy Doucette, J.J.

It was based on the 1961 book ''Car, Boy, Girl'' by Gordon Buford.\n\nThe movie follows the adventures of Herbie, Herbie's driver, Jim Douglas ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), and Jim's [[Romantic interest|love interest]], Carole Bennett ([[Michele Lee]]). It also features [[Buddy Hackett]] as Jim's enlightened, kind-hearted friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, a character who creates \"art\" from used car parts. English actor [[David Tomlinson]] portrays the villainous Peter Thorndyke, (familiar from his role as Mr. George Banks in ''[[Mary Poppins (1964 film)|Mary Poppins]]'') the owner of an [[automobile|auto]] [[showroom]] and an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] national champion who sells Herbie to Jim and eventually becomes his racing rival.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1968, Jim Douglas is a miserable [[racing driver]], reduced to competing in [[demolition derby]] races against drivers half his age. Jim lives in an old [[fire house]] overlooking [[San Francisco Bay]] with his friend and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz, a jolly Brooklynite who constantly extols the virtues of [[spiritual enlightenment]], having spent time amongst [[Buddhist monks]] in [[Tibet]], and builds \"art\" from car parts. After yet another race ends in a crash (and Tennessee turns his [[Edsel]] into a sculpture), Jim finds himself without a car and heads into town in search of some cheap wheels. He is enticed into an upmarket European car showroom after setting eyes on an attractive sales assistant and mechanic, Carole Bennett. Jim witnesses the dealership's British owner, Peter Thorndyke, being unnecessarily abusive towards a white [[Volkswagen Beetle]] that rolls into the showroom, and defends the car's honor, much to Thorndyke's displeasure. The following morning, Jim is shocked to find that the car is parked outside his house and that Thorndyke is pressing charges for [[motor vehicle theft|grand theft]]. A heated argument between Jim and Thorndyke is settled when Carole persuades Thorndyke to drop the charges if Jim purchases the car on a system of monthly payments.\n\nJim soon finds that the car is prone to going completely out of his control and believes Thorndyke has conned him. Tennessee, however, believes certain inanimate objects to have hearts and minds of their own and tries to befriend the car, naming it [[Herbie]]. Jim's feelings about his new acquisition soon improve when it appears that Herbie is intent on bringing him and Carole together. He also discovers Herbie to have an incredible turn of speed for a car of his size and decides to take him [[motor racing|racing]]. After watching Jim and Herbie win their first race together, Thorndyke, himself a major force on the local racing scene, offers to cancel the remaining payments Jim owes on Herbie if Jim can win a race that they will both be competing in at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] later that month. Jim accepts, and despite Thorndyke's underhanded tactics, he and Herbie take the victory. Over the next few months, they go on to become the toast of the Californian racing circuit, while Thorndyke suffers increasingly humiliating defeats. Thorndyke finally loses his composure and persuades Carole to take Jim out on a date while he sneaks round to Jim's house. After Tennessee gets drunk on his own [[Irish coffee]] recipe, Thorndyke proceeds to tip the remainder of the alcoholic coffee and whipped cream into Herbie's gas tank. At the following day's race, an apparently hungover Herbie shudders to a halt and backfires while Thorndyke blasts to victory. However, as the crowd admires Thorndyke's victory, Herbie blows some whipped cream out of his exhaust pipe, covering Thorndyke.\n\nThat evening, Carole comes to Jim's house to help Tennessee repair Herbie. Carole then hears the whole truth about Herbie having a mind of his own and having a great speed for winning races instead of Jim. Jim returns home in a brand new [[Lamborghini 400GT]], and has agreed to sell Herbie to Thorndyke to pay the remaining installments that he owes on it. Jim states his need for a \"big and strong car\" to drive in the upcoming El Dorado [[road racing|road race]], but finds no sympathy from Tennessee or Carole. Carole also angrily confronts Jim to make him realize that he did not care about Herbie and that he was not winning any of the races he participated in after hearing what Tennessee said to her, and she believed him. Jim also doesn't get sympathy from Herbie who proceeds to damage the Lamborghini, and this angers Jim, causing him to damage Herbie with a shovel. Tennessee tries to stop Jim and says that Herbie was jealous and Jim agrees because he gets the credit for winning races. By the moment he says this, it really does makes him realize that Herbie has a mind of his own. By the time Thorndyke arrives to collect Herbie, Jim refuses the money from him and then sees that Herbie has run away. Jim sets off into the night hoping to find Herbie and make amends before the car is seized by Thorndyke's goons. After narrowly escaping being torn apart in Thorndyke's workshop, and a destructive spree through [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], during the Chinese New Year's parade, Herbie is about to [[Suicide|launch himself]] off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] when Jim reaches him. In his attempt to stop Herbie from driving off the bridge, Jim nearly falls into the water. Herbie pulls Jim back to safety after seeing that it is Jim and that he does care about him, but is then impounded by the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. There, Tang Wu, ([[Benson Fong]]) a Chinese businessman whose store was damaged during Herbie's rampage, demands [[Damages|compensation]] that Jim can no longer afford. Using the Chinese language he had learned while in Tibet, Tennessee tries to reason with Wu, and learns that he is a huge racing fan who knows all about Jim and Herbie's exploits. Wu is willing to drop the charges in exchange for becoming Herbie's new owner. Jim agrees to this, as long as Wu allows him to race the car in the El Dorado. If Jim wins, Wu will be able to keep the prize money, but will then be required to sell Herbie back for one [[US dollar|dollar]]. Wu replies to this proposal in clear English: \"Now you speak my language.\"\n[[File:Herbie the Matchmaker.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dean Jones in ''The Love Bug'']]\n\nThe El Dorado runs through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains from [[Yosemite Valley]] to [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and back. Before the start of the race, Thorndyke persuades Wu to make a wager with him on its outcome. Thorndyke (with his assistant Havershaw acting as [[co-driver]]) initiates every trick known to man to ensure that he and his Thorndyke Special are leading at end of the first leg of the race. As a result of Thorndyke's shenanigans, Jim (with Carole and Tennessee as co-drivers) limps home last with Herbie missing two wheels and having to use a wagon wheel to get to the finish line. Despite Tennessee's best efforts, it looks as if Herbie will be unable to start the return leg of the race the following morning. Thorndyke then arrives and claims that this makes him the new owner of the car. Wu regretfully tells Jim of the wager and that in accordance with its terms this is true. Thorndyke, thinking he is Herbie's new owner, gloats to Jim about what he is going to do to Herbie and kicks Herbie's front fender, and punches Jim, but Herbie then unexpectedly lurches into life and chases Thorndyke from the scene, showing that he is more than willing to race on. Thanks to some ingenious shortcuts, Jim is able to make up for lost time in the second leg and is neck and neck with Thorndyke as they approach the finish line. In the ensuing dogfight, Herbie's hastily [[welding|welded]]-together body splits in two. The back half (carrying Tennessee and the engine) crosses the line just ahead of Thorndyke, while the front (carrying Jim and Carole) rolls over the line just behind, meaning Herbie takes both first ''and'' third place.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the wager, Wu takes over Thorndyke's car dealership (hiring Tennessee as his assistant), while Thorndyke and Havershaw are relegated to lowly mechanics. Meanwhile, a fully repaired Herbie chauffeurs the newlywed Jim and Carole away on their honeymoon.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Jim Douglas, a racing driver\n*[[Michele Lee]] as Carole Bennet, Jim's love interest\n*[[David Tomlinson]] as Peter Thorndyke, the owner of the car shop \n*[[Buddy Hackett]] as Tennessee Steinmetz, Jim's friend and roommate and partner in racing\n*[[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] as Havershaw, Thorndyke's right-hand man\n*[[Benson Fong]] as Tang Wu, Jim's friend and team supporter\n*[[Joe E.

Although Jones tried to pitch him a serious, straightforward film project concerning the story of the first [[sports car]] ever brought to the United States, Walt suggested a different car story for him, which was ''Car, Boy, Girl'', a story written in 1961 by Gordon Buford.\n\n''Car, Boy, Girl;'' ''The Magic Volksy;'' ''The Runaway Wagen;'' ''Beetlebomb;'' ''Wonderbeetle;'' ''Bugboom'' and ''Thunderbug'' were among the original development titles considered for the film before the title was finalized as ''The Love Bug.''\n\nHerbie competes in the [[Monterey Grand Prix]], which, except for 1963, was not a sports car race. The actual sports car race held at Monterey was the [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]]. The 1968 Monterey Grand Prix was in fact a [[Can Am Series]] race, and did not feature production cars.\n\nPeter Thorndyke's yellow \"Special\" is actually a 1965 [[Apollo (1962 automobile)|Apollo GT]], a rare sports car built in the United States by International Motorcars in [[Oakland, California]]. It used an Italian-designed body along with a small-block [[Buick V8 engine|Buick]] V8 engine. This car exists today, is in the hands of a private collector, and has been restored as it was seen in the film with its yellow paint and number 14 logo.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Thorndyke Special|url=http://barnfinds.com/thorndyke-special/|website=Barnfinds.com}}</ref>\n\n===\"Herbie\"===\n[[File:Herbie film car from The Love Bug.jpg|left|thumb|One of the original cars used during the filming of ''The Love Bug'']]\nBefore film began production, the titular car was not specified as a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and Disney set up a casting call for a dozen cars to audition. In the lineup, there were a few [[Toyota]]s, a [[TVR]], a handful of [[Volvo]]s, an [[MG Cars|MG]] and a pearl white Volkswagen Beetle. The Volkswagen Beetle was chosen as it was the only one that elicited the crew to reach out and pet it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Volkswagen brand name, logo or shield does not feature anywhere in the film, as the automaker did not permit Disney to use the name. The only logos can be briefly seen in at least two places, however. The first instance is on the brake pedals during the first scene where Herbie takes control with Jim inside (on the freeway when Herbie runs into Thorndyke's Rolls Royce), and it is shown in all the future scenes when Jim is braking. The second instance is on the ignition key, when Jim tries to shut down the braking Herbie. The later sequels produced, however, do promote the Volkswagen name (as sales of the Beetle were down when the sequels were produced). The VW \"[[Wolfsburg]]\" castle emblem on the steering wheel hub is also seen throughout the car's interior shots. Within the script, the car was only ever referred to as \"Herbie\", \"the small car\" or \"the Bug\"\u2014the latter, although a common nickname for the Beetle, was not trademarked by Volkswagen at the time of filming.\n\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Align = Right\n|Image = LAret53.PNG\n|Name = Donald Drysdale\n|Number = 53\n|Team = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|Year = 1984\n}}\n\nThe car was later given the name \"Herbie\" from one of [[Buddy Hackett]]'s [[Sketch comedy|skit]]s about a ski instructor named Klaus, who speaks with a German accent as he introduces his fellow ski instructors, who are named Hans, Fritz, Wilhelm, and Sandor. At the end of the skit, Hackett would say \"If you ain't got a Herbie (pronounced \"''hoy-bee''{{-\"}}), I ain't going.\"\n\nHerbie's trademark \"53\" racing number was chosen by producer [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], who was a fan of [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball player [[Don Drysdale]] (Drysdale's jersey number, later retired by the team, was 53).\n\nWalsh also gave Herbie his trademark red, white and blue [[racing stripe]]s presumably for the more [[patriotic]] color and came up with the film's gags such as Herbie squirting oil and opening the doors by himself.<ref>DVD commentary, ''The Love Bug'', 2003</ref>\n\nBenson Fong, who played Mr. Wu, said that when he and the others were dragged along the dirt by Herbie, it was like being pulled by 40 horses. The 1961\u20131965 Volkswagen Beetles actually were rated by the [[SAE International|SAE]] at {{convert|40|hp}} in factory configuration (though only {{convert|34|hp}} by the European [[DIN]] system which measured engine output as installed in the car with cooling fan and exhaust system attached).\n\nHerbie has his own cast billing in the closing credits, the only time this was done in the entire series of films.\n\nToday, only a handful of the original Herbie cars are known to exist. Car #10 was recovered from a warehouse in Pennsylvania, and has been preserved\u2014still sporting its original paint from the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Love Bug Reunion|url=http://barnfinds.com/love-bug-reunion/|website=Barnfinds.com}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nThe bonuses on the DVD provide two deleted scenes named \"Used Car Lot\" and \"Playground\".\n\nA scene shot, but not included in the final cut of the film, featured Jim calling at a [[Car dealership|used car lot]] prior to his visiting Thorndyke's auto showroom. This missing sequence has long since been lost, and all that remains is the [[Screenplay|script]] and a single [[black-and-white]] photograph of Jim talking with the salesman at the lot.\n\nAn unfilmed scene at the end of the story that was scripted and [[storyboard]]ed was to have shown Herbie playing with children at a nearby [[playground]] prior to taking the newly married Jim and Carole off on their honeymoon.\n\n===Stock footage===\nThe opening scene of the [[demolition derby]] cars is [[stock footage|footage]] from the film ''[[Fireball 500]].'' Parts of this scene can also be found in a 1966-model year dealer promotional film by Chevrolet, titled ''Impact '66''.\n\n===Shooting locations===\nSome of the racetrack scenes were shot at the [[Riverside International Raceway]] in [[Riverside, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Sam|title=Shelby, American|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=May 2014|volume=65|issue=8|page=65}}</ref> Others were filmed at [[Laguna Seca Raceway]] in [[Monterey, California]], [[Willow Springs Raceway]] in [[Willow Springs, Kern County, California|Willow Springs, California]] and [[Paramount Ranch Racetrack|Paramount Ranch]] in [[Agoura Hills, California]].
