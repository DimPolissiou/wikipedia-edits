The original schoolroom was used as one of the dining rooms before closure, and it is surrounded by the 'Foundation' block, which was mainly built during the mid part of the 19th century. As one moves North East along the valley, the buildings generally get progressively newer, ending with the Science Block and the Management Centre. Most of the buildings are either built with or faced by the distinctive red sandstone which is characteristic of the buildings at the school. School House is located on the main site, but the other boarding houses are all located across the railway tracks to the South \u2013 Grindal in a large former hotel, while the other three houses occupy the whole of Londsdale Terrace, a row of houses owned by the school. The school also owns a building just across the road from the main school, which was occupied by the Music Department. The [[St Bees Priory|Priory Church]] was used by the school for major services throughout the year as the chapel was too small.\n\nThe buildings around the main quadrangle in the Foundation block are a grade II [[listed building]],<ref>{{cite web|title=British Listed Buildings \u2013 St Bees School Buildings|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-76160-st-bees-school-buildings-around-quadrangl|accessdate=2 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928050124/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-76160-st-bees-school-buildings-around-quadrangl|archive-date=28 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> granting them additional protections under English law.

Although the school had a difficult start due to the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] initially refusing to sign the [[letters patent]] establishing the school, it eventually began to grow, partially due to its ownership of the mineral rights to surrounding land. However, despite selling the mining rights for much less than they were worth and taking part in a resulting legal tussle which lasted for the latter half of the 18th century, the school expanded rapidly throughout the 19th century, building much of the campus as seen today. The school did, however, have to be rescued by former members of the school in 1938 due to a financial crisis caused by a sudden drop in pupil numbers.<ref name=futstbees>{{cite news|title=Future of St.Bees School|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4zU1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=LKYLAAAAIBAJ&pg=4828,1044550&dq=st+bees+school&hl=en|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=7 July 1938}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015 it was announced by the School Governors that due to falling pupil numbers and the high cost of their school fees, the school would temporarily close and be refurbished in Summer 2015.<ref name=\"whitehavennews.co.uk\">[http://www.whitehavennews.co.uk/news/span-style-color-red-breaking-news-span-st-bees-school-to-close-down-1.1198931 Whitehaven news web site 13 March 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722180736/http://www.whitehavennews.co.uk/news/span-style-color-red-breaking-news-span-st-bees-school-to-close-down-1.1198931 |date=22 July 2015 }}</ref> However, in March 2017 it was announced that the school would re-open in September 2018 in a partnership with Full Circle Education Group, a South East Asian education group.<ref>Press release from St Bees School trustees.

The original Elizabethan school is the range on the left of the quad.]]\nThe school was founded by the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Edmund Grindal]]. He had been born in the village of [[St Bees]], at still-standing Cross Hill House.<ref>\"Archbishop Grindal's Birthplace: Cross Hill, St. Bees Cumbria\", By John and Mary Todd. Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society 1999, Vol XCIX.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Veterans look to the future|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/veterans-look-to-the-future-1.352513?referrerPath=home/2.1962|publisher=[[News and Star]]|date=13 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nHaving fallen out of favour with [[Queen Elizabeth I]], and though ill and blind, Grindal refused to resign his position until the Queen signed the letters patent which would create the \"Free Grammar School\" at St Bees. The school was founded in 1583, the year of his death. Thanks to his having made an agreement with [[the Queen's College, Oxford]], and his purchase of local tithes, the school prospered both financially and academically.\n\n===Early years===\nAlthough specifically incorporated for the education of boys from [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], as early as 1604 people from outside [[Cumbria]] were being educated at St. Bees in the original schoolroom (now one of the school dining rooms) near the Priory Church.  The school slowly expanded, despite one Headmaster who worked his pupils like labourers.  The school had enjoyed some financial security for many years, lessened in 1742 when the school sold [[Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet|Sir James Lowther]] an eight hundred and sixty-seven-year mineral lease for much less than market value.\n\n===Modern growth===\nIn the nineteenth century the school started to look like it is now.  Thanks to a resolution of the mineral rights issue being obtained through the Court of Chancery in 1842, the school was able to physically expand, with what is now the \"Quadrangle\" being built, Grindal House (formerly a hotel) purchased and the Headmaster's Residence being constructed.  At the turn of the twentieth century the School Chapel was built, along with what is now the Art Department and the School Library, and the swimming baths.  By the outbreak of the [[First World War]] the school had reached a peak of three hundred pupils, a figure which would not be seen again for some years.\n[[File:St Bees Scool VC memorial.jpg|thumb|right|The VC memorial in the school chapel.]]\nDuring the Great War three old boys of the school were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for military gallantry in Britain and many of the [[British Commonwealth]] countries (see [[History of St. Bees School#V.C. Winners|St. Bees V.C. winners]] for more details.  Old boy [[Alfred Critchley]] became one of the youngest [[Brigadier-General]]s in the [[British Empire]] at the age of twenty-seven for his heroic conduct (he was older than [[Roland Boys Bradford]], V.C. but younger than [[Bernard Freyberg]], V.C.).  One hundred and eighty old boys gave their lives during the war, and a special memorial was built overlooking the sports fields where so many had previously played.<ref>Aldous, M.A., J.W. (1921).

The situation became so critical that the Governors of the School attempted to have the school nationalised.

Students will gain much from outdoor learning opportunities and outdoor activities e.g. walking, kayaking, bouldering, climbing, fell running and camping are organised regularly.

The original schoolroom was used as one of the dining rooms before closure, and it is surrounded by the 'Foundation' block, which was mainly built during the mid part of the 19th century. As one moves North East along the valley, the buildings generally get progressively newer, ending with the Science Block and the Management Centre. Most of the buildings are either built with or faced by the distinctive red sandstone which is characteristic of the buildings at the school. School House is located on the main site, but the other boarding houses are all located across the railway tracks to the South \u2013 Grindal in a large former hotel, while the other three houses occupy the whole of Londsdale Terrace, a row of houses owned by the school. The school also owns a building just across the road from the main school, which was occupied by the Music Department. The [[St Bees Priory|Priory Church]] was used by the school for major services throughout the year as the chapel was too small.\n\nThe buildings around the main quadrangle in the Foundation block are a grade II [[listed building]],<ref>{{cite web|title=British Listed Buildings \u2013 St Bees School Buildings|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-76160-st-bees-school-buildings-around-quadrangl|accessdate=2 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928050124/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-76160-st-bees-school-buildings-around-quadrangl|archive-date=28 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> granting them additional protections under English law.

Although the school had a difficult start due to the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] initially refusing to sign the [[letters patent]] establishing the school, it eventually began to grow, partially due to its ownership of the mineral rights to surrounding land. However, despite selling the mining rights for much less than they were worth and taking part in a resulting legal tussle which lasted for the latter half of the 18th century, the school expanded rapidly throughout the 19th century, building much of the campus as seen today. The school did, however, have to be rescued by former members of the school in 1938 due to a financial crisis caused by a sudden drop in pupil numbers.<ref name=futstbees>{{cite news|title=Future of St.Bees School|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4zU1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=LKYLAAAAIBAJ&pg=4828,1044550&dq=st+bees+school&hl=en|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=7 July 1938}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015 it was announced by the School Governors that due to falling pupil numbers and the high cost of their school fees, the school would temporarily close and be refurbished in Summer 2015.<ref name=\"whitehavennews.co.uk\">[http://www.whitehavennews.co.uk/news/span-style-color-red-breaking-news-span-st-bees-school-to-close-down-1.1198931 Whitehaven news web site 13 March 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722180736/http://www.whitehavennews.co.uk/news/span-style-color-red-breaking-news-span-st-bees-school-to-close-down-1.1198931 |date=22 July 2015 }}</ref> However, in March 2017 it was announced that the school would re-open in September 2018 in a partnership with Full Circle Education Group, a South East Asian education group.<ref>Press release from St Bees School trustees.

The original Elizabethan school is the range on the left of the quad.]]\nThe school was founded by the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Edmund Grindal]]. He had been born in the village of [[St Bees]], at still-standing Cross Hill House.<ref>\"Archbishop Grindal's Birthplace: Cross Hill, St. Bees Cumbria\", By John and Mary Todd. Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society 1999, Vol XCIX.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Veterans look to the future|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/veterans-look-to-the-future-1.352513?referrerPath=home/2.1962|publisher=[[News and Star]]|date=13 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nHaving fallen out of favour with [[Queen Elizabeth I]], and though ill and blind, Grindal refused to resign his position until the Queen signed the letters patent which would create the \"Free Grammar School\" at St Bees. The school was founded in 1583, the year of his death. Thanks to his having made an agreement with [[the Queen's College, Oxford]], and his purchase of local tithes, the school prospered both financially and academically.\n\n===Early years===\nAlthough specifically incorporated for the education of boys from [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], as early as 1604 people from outside [[Cumbria]] were being educated at St. Bees in the original schoolroom (now one of the school dining rooms) near the Priory Church.  The school slowly expanded, despite one Headmaster who worked his pupils like labourers.  The school had enjoyed some financial security for many years, lessened in 1742 when the school sold [[Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet|Sir James Lowther]] an eight hundred and sixty-seven-year mineral lease for much less than market value.\n\n===Modern growth===\nIn the nineteenth century the school started to look like it is now.  Thanks to a resolution of the mineral rights issue being obtained through the Court of Chancery in 1842, the school was able to physically expand, with what is now the \"Quadrangle\" being built, Grindal House (formerly a hotel) purchased and the Headmaster's Residence being constructed.  At the turn of the twentieth century the School Chapel was built, along with what is now the Art Department and the School Library, and the swimming baths.  By the outbreak of the [[First World War]] the school had reached a peak of three hundred pupils, a figure which would not be seen again for some years.\n[[File:St Bees Scool VC memorial.jpg|thumb|right|The VC memorial in the school chapel.]]\nDuring the Great War three old boys of the school were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for military gallantry in Britain and many of the [[British Commonwealth]] countries (see [[History of St. Bees School#V.C. Winners|St. Bees V.C. winners]] for more details.  Old boy [[Alfred Critchley]] became one of the youngest [[Brigadier-General]]s in the [[British Empire]] at the age of twenty-seven for his heroic conduct (he was older than [[Roland Boys Bradford]], V.C. but younger than [[Bernard Freyberg]], V.C.).  One hundred and eighty old boys gave their lives during the war, and a special memorial was built overlooking the sports fields where so many had previously played.<ref>Aldous, M.A., J.W. (1921).

Edinburgh: University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war the number of students remained high, but in common with many other schools the numbers decreased and then went into free-fall during the 1930s.  The situation became so critical that the Governors of the School attempted to have the school nationalised.
