The four years he was at OU, the team won the [[NCAA]] Team Championship twice and took second behind OSU the other two years.  As an individual, Baughman won the NCAA Championship once and finished 2nd twice.  He also won the [[Big Eight Conference|Big 8]] Championship twice, was 2nd once and received both the Most Falls Trophy and Outstanding Wrestler Award his senior season (1963).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBaughman was on three Olympic teams (1964, 1968 & 1972) and eight World Championship (WC) teams.

He then spent five years as an instructor and coach at the [[United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School]], five years as Chief of Air Force Programs (Athletic Director of the entire Air Force) at HQ USAF, then nine years as an instructor and head wrestling coach at the [[United States Air Force Academy]].  After retiring from USAF active duty, he served as Director of Operations and Assistant General Manager for the 1986 World [[Cycling]] Championships, wrote the book ''Wrestling On and Off the Mat'' ({{ISBN|978-0961844608}}) and did speaking engagements and Clinics.  Baughman returned to the head wrestling coach position as a civilian. He served as an Athletes Representative on many wrestling committees.\n\nKyle Klingman, associate director at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum, documented the impact of Baughman's career by stating:\n{{quote|Despite all of his accomplishments in wrestling, it's the praise of his peers that speaks loudest for Baughman. John Peterson, a gold medalist at the 1976 Olympics, calls Baughman a man of great integrity. Peterson speaks with reverence about the time Baughman stood up to the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] when the 'committee' questioned how well John and his brother Ben would do at the Olympics in 1972. (Ben and John eventually won a gold and silver medal respectively). Five-time world medalist Larry Kristoff calls him one of the classiest guys he's ever met and wrestling icon [[Dan Gable]] calls Baughman 'one tough dude'.}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBaughman is one of 33 native Oklahomans who have been inducted as Distinguished Members of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMike Chapman, Executive Director of the Dan Gable International Wrestling Institute and Museum, wrote a book called ''Wrestling Tough'' ({{ISBN|978-0736056373}}). He described Baughman saying he:\n{{quote|was known as a wrestler who would go all out in every match. He was always in superb condition, and his mental approach to the sport was second to none. A gentleman and Air Force officer off the mat, he ran marathons without extra training just to test himself and his mental toughness. He was a fierce combatant on the mat. He asked for no quarter in any match, and he offered none.  'I always wrestle to hurt my opponent but never to injure him,' he explained. 'There is a definite difference in hurt and injure. If my opponent is distracted by pain, he is not thinking clearly about what else I am doing to him or what he is going to do to me. I will not jeopardize a joint if a person can\u2019t turn to relieve the pressure but if they can turn to neutralize the pressure or pain then it becomes their choice.'|(Chapman, 139)}}\n\nAfter completing his competitive wrestling career, Baughman became involved in ultra-endurance events. He has completed the [[Pikes Peak Marathon]] five times, the Iron Man [[Triathlon]] in [[Hawaii]], the Leadville 100 Mile Trail run twice, The \"Bad Water 146\" mile run, the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim and Back Again, the Hardscrabble Pass 100 mile Bicycle.  Lastly, Baughman is included in another Mike Chapman book, ''The Toughest Men in Sports'' ({{ISBN|978-0967608013}}) and was the model for the man at the base of the Air Force Monument in downtown Oklahoma City.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baughman, R.

Baughman returned to the head wrestling coach position as a civilian. He served as an Athletes Representative on many wrestling committees.\n\nKyle Klingman, associate director at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum, documented the impact of Baughman's career by stating:\n{{quote|Despite all of his accomplishments in wrestling, it's the praise of his peers that speaks loudest for Baughman. John Peterson, a gold medalist at the 1976 Olympics, calls Baughman a man of great integrity. Peterson speaks with reverence about the time Baughman stood up to the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] when the 'committee' questioned how well John and his brother Ben would do at the Olympics in 1972. (Ben and John eventually won a gold and silver medal respectively). Five-time world medalist Larry Kristoff calls him one of the classiest guys he's ever met and wrestling icon [[Dan Gable]] calls Baughman 'one tough dude'.}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBaughman is one of 33 native Oklahomans who have been inducted as Distinguished Members of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMike Chapman, Executive Director of the Dan Gable International Wrestling Institute and Museum, wrote a book called ''Wrestling Tough'' ({{ISBN|978-0736056373}}). He described Baughman saying he:\n{{quote|was known as a wrestler who would go all out in every match. He was always in superb condition, and his mental approach to the sport was second to none. A gentleman and Air Force officer off the mat, he ran marathons without extra training just to test himself and his mental toughness. He was a fierce combatant on the mat. He asked for no quarter in any match, and he offered none.  'I always wrestle to hurt my opponent but never to injure him,' he explained. 'There is a definite difference in hurt and injure. If my opponent is distracted by pain, he is not thinking clearly about what else I am doing to him or what he is going to do to me. I will not jeopardize a joint if a person can\u2019t turn to relieve the pressure but if they can turn to neutralize the pressure or pain then it becomes their choice.'|(Chapman, 139)}}\n\nAfter completing his competitive wrestling career, Baughman became involved in ultra-endurance events. He has completed the [[Pikes Peak Marathon]] five times, the Iron Man [[Triathlon]] in [[Hawaii]], the Leadville 100 Mile Trail run twice, The \"Bad Water 146\" mile run, the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim and Back Again, the Hardscrabble Pass 100 mile Bicycle.  Lastly, Baughman is included in another Mike Chapman book, ''The Toughest Men in Sports'' ({{ISBN|978-0967608013}}) and was the model for the man at the base of the Air Force Monument in downtown Oklahoma City.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baughman, R.

Dolphin]]). The Canada Post building was built in 1938,  to assist in the recent population growth of Toronto and its surrounding area.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> The building was handed over to Department of National Defence for war storage purposes upon completion in 1941, but returned to Canada Post in 1946. Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence. After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. In the early 1990s, the building needed major renovations. To cut costs, Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s on Eastern Avenue.  Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993. The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern wall of the original postal structure built in 1941, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n===Arena 'Wars'===\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the Toronto Blue Jays had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.

Dolphin]]). The Canada Post building was built in 1938,  to assist in the recent population growth of Toronto and its surrounding area.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> The building was handed over to Department of National Defence for war storage purposes upon completion in 1941, but returned to Canada Post in 1946. Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence. After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. In the early 1990s, the building needed major renovations. To cut costs, Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s on Eastern Avenue.  Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n===Arena 'Wars'===\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the Toronto Blue Jays had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.
