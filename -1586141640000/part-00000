It was rare to find wind or stringed instrument players close to dancers in the same scene. However, it was noted that whenever musicians are depicted, dancers were not generally far away.\n\n== Types of dancing ==\nLexov\u00e1 set out classifications for the various dances of the period: the purely movemental dance, the gymnastic dance, the imitative dance, the pair dance, the group dance, the [[war dance]], the dramatic dance, the lyrical dance, the grotesque dance, the funeral dance and the [[Sacred dance|religious dance]].<ref name=\"Lexova\"/>\n\nDance scholar and performer Elizabeth \"Artemis\" Mourat also categorized dances into six types: religious dances, non-religious dances, banquet dances, harem dances, combat dances and street dances.<ref name=\"Music & Dance\"/>\n\n=== Solo, pair and group dances ===\n[[File:Tomb of the Dancers (detail).JPG|thumb|Tomb of the Dancers, wall painting, 17th Dynasty, Thebes, [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]]]\n\nAncient Egyptian dancers danced either as [[Solo dance|soloists]], in [[Couple dance|pairs]] or in [[Group dance|groups]], depending on the occasion and type of the dance performed.

An image from this time depicted female pair dancers with canes. [[5th dynasty]] female dancers are shown to hold hands while performing in unison. The dances used symmetrical and dramatic movements and conveyed emotions such as longing or depression.<ref name=\"Kassing 46\"/>\n\n==== Group dances ====\nThere were two types of Egyptian group dances. One was performed in individual movements that confirmed a theme or idea or was carried out spontaneously as in prehistoric times. Dancers competed with one another, often in groups, substituting movement that were later established in funeral dances rites.(Lexov\u00e1 1935) A second type featured pairs or ranks of dancers who executed repetitive movements in a circle.

It involved leaping or skipping and was accompanied by a sung or spoken prayer to the sounds of percussion, including the clapping of hands and sticks.<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nAnother specialized troupe of sacred dancers, ''mww'' or muu dancers, existed across the Kingdoms.

The dances they performed were farewell performances associated with the departure of the sun. The dwarfs were used as they were thought to represent the sun due to their stunted growth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} There are indications that dancing dwarfs replaced ''mww'' dancers at the tomb entrance by the twentieth dynasty.<ref name=\"Bleiberg\"/><ref name=\"Lexova 62\">Lexov\u00e1 2000, p. 62.</ref> Lexov\u00e1 notes an image of the dancers of the dwarf dances wearing similar crowns.<ref name=\"Lexova 62\"/>\n\nAfter the New Kingdom changes of tomb decoration took place funerary dances were no longer depicted on tomb walls but were found in temples instead. The dancing scenes portrayed in temples reflected both royal and divine ceremonies. All dancing scenes had one common feature that being the solemn procession of the sacred barks carrying a god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Festive dances ===\nAmong the festivals during which dancing took place the following are enumerated:{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n* [[Sed festival]] dances took place during jubilee ceremonies which celebrated the renewal pledge to the king. Such dances varied in accordance to the religious significance and the reflection of the local mythology of the God to whom they were directed.\n* [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley|Valley festival]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] celebrates the God [[Amun]]'s trip from [[Karnak]] temple to visit the tombs on the West Bank passing by the sanctuary of Hathor. As the procession moved from one place to another, families rejoiced and danced.\n* [[Opet Festival]]: another event associated with God Amun's visit to his wife Goddess [[Mut]] from Karnak Temple to [[Luxor]] temple. This procession was marked by groups of women doing acrobatic dances together with dark dancers, probably [[Nubia]]ns who jumped and merged with the drums.\n* Feast of Min: god of fertility and regeneration: The dancers in this feast were members of his cult. Drawings representing this feast showed priests and monkeys dancing. These drawings could have had a symbolic meaning rather than an actual representation of reality.\n* Nile Flood Feast: (The New Year celebration): Dancing played a vital role in this festivity as it helped transform the dangerous [[Sekhmet]] into the mild Hathor, thereby protecting the ancient land from Sekhmet's evil and deadly demons. These dances included all possible forms of movement including acrobats and exotic foreign dances.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Kinney, Troy; Kinney, Margaret West (1914).

It was rare to find wind or stringed instrument players close to dancers in the same scene. However, it was noted that whenever musicians are depicted, dancers were not generally far away.\n\n== Types of dancing ==\nLexov\u00e1 set out classifications for the various dances of the period: the purely movemental dance, the gymnastic dance, the imitative dance, the pair dance, the group dance, the [[war dance]], the dramatic dance, the lyrical dance, the grotesque dance, the funeral dance and the [[Sacred dance|religious dance]].<ref name=\"Lexova\"/>\n\nDance scholar and performer Elizabeth \"Artemis\" Mourat also categorized dances into six types: religious dances, non-religious dances, banquet dances, harem dances, combat dances and street dances.<ref name=\"Music & Dance\"/>\n\n=== Solo, pair and group dances ===\n[[File:Tomb of the Dancers (detail).JPG|thumb|Tomb of the Dancers, wall painting, 17th Dynasty, Thebes, [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]]]\n\nAncient Egyptian dancers danced either as [[Solo dance|soloists]], in [[Couple dance|pairs]] or in [[Group dance|groups]], depending on the occasion and type of the dance performed.

An image from this time depicted female pair dancers with canes. [[5th dynasty]] female dancers are shown to hold hands while performing in unison.  The dances used symmetrical and dramatic movements and conveyed emotions such as longing or depression.<ref name=\"Kassing 46\"/>\n\n==== Group dances ====\nThere were two types of Egyptian group dances. One was performed in individual movements that confirmed a theme or idea or was carried out spontaneously as in prehistoric times. Dancers competed with one another, often in groups, substituting movement that were later established in funeral dances rites.(Lexov\u00e1 1935) A second type featured pairs or ranks of dancers who executed repetitive movements in a circle.

It involved leaping or skipping and was accompanied by a sung or spoken prayer to the sounds of percussion, including the clapping of hands and sticks.<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nAnother specialized troupe of sacred dancers, ''mww'' or muu dancers, existed across the Kingdoms.

The dances they performed were farewell performances associated with the departure of the sun. The dwarfs were used as they were thought to represent the sun due to their stunted growth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} There are indications that dancing dwarfs replaced ''mww'' dancers at the tomb entrance by the twentieth dynasty.<ref name=\"Bleiberg\"/><ref name=\"Lexova 62\">Lexov\u00e1 2000, p. 62.</ref> Lexov\u00e1 notes an image of the dancers of the dwarf dances wearing similar crowns.<ref name=\"Lexova 62\"/>\n\nAfter the New Kingdom changes of tomb decoration took place funerary dances were no longer depicted on tomb walls but were found in temples instead. The dancing scenes portrayed in temples reflected both royal and divine ceremonies. All dancing scenes had one common feature that being the solemn procession of the sacred barks carrying a god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Festive dances ===\nAmong the festivals during which dancing took place the following are enumerated:{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n* [[Sed festival]] dances took place during jubilee ceremonies which celebrated the renewal pledge to the king. Such dances varied in accordance to the religious significance and the reflection of the local mythology of the God to whom they were directed.\n* [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley|Valley festival]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] celebrates the God [[Amun]]'s trip from [[Karnak]] temple to visit the tombs on the West Bank passing by the sanctuary of Hathor. As the procession moved from one place to another, families rejoiced and danced.\n* [[Opet Festival]]: another event associated with God Amun's visit to his wife Goddess [[Mut]] from Karnak Temple to [[Luxor]] temple. This procession was marked by groups of women doing acrobatic dances together with dark dancers, probably [[Nubia]]ns who jumped and merged with the drums.\n* Feast of Min: god of fertility and regeneration: The dancers in this feast were members of his cult. Drawings representing this feast showed priests and monkeys dancing. These drawings could have had a symbolic meaning rather than an actual representation of reality.\n* Nile Flood Feast: (The New Year celebration): Dancing played a vital role in this festivity as it helped transform the dangerous [[Sekhmet]] into the mild Hathor, thereby protecting the ancient land from Sekhmet's evil and deadly demons. These dances included all possible forms of movement including acrobats and exotic foreign dances.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Kinney, Troy; Kinney, Margaret West (1914).

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916, and fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a leading member of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows; fifteen show Irish saints, the remainder show Christ, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] and [[John the Baptist|St. John]]. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who died in August 1913{{sfn|Rogers|1997|p=209}} Her will left a total donation to the city of \u00a340,000 gave \u00a310,000, left [[Trust law|in trust]] to O'Connell, the sole executor of her will.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the small chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by 9th century [[Irish round tower|round towers]].{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe western entrance is approached by double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The chapel's doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows.

Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J.

Brigid is depicted alongside a [[bovine|calf]], Patrick with a [[shamrock]] in his right hand, and Columcille alongside two flying [[doves]].

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing had to be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=210-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212-213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], as Jesus is traditionally thought to have risen from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the resurrection.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}{{sfn|Lawrence|1962|pp=289-296}} The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death.

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916, and fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a leading member of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows; fifteen show Irish saints, the remainder show Christ, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] and [[John the Baptist|St. John]]. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who died in August 1913{{sfn|Rogers|1997|p=209}} Her will left a total donation to the city of \u00a340,000 gave \u00a310,000, left [[Trust law|in trust]] to O'Connell, the sole executor of her will.

Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Around them, two angles carry the sun, moon, and other symbols of creation. The lower rectangular panel, representing the doorway, shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on brightly coloured altar decorated with three ringed crosses. Two angels acting as servers kneel before him. The adoration panel is set against a background of branches and leaves attached in [[silver-gilt]].{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\nThe lower panel also shows the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, surrounded by what Teehan describes as \"the deep blue void of Heaven\".{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}} Here he is accompanied by flights of angels, bearing instruments of the passion.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} The enamel embellishments were added by the Irish craftsman and stained glass specialist Oswald Reeves,{{sfn|Larmour|1992|p=186}} and have been described as the best of his work.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\n===Pipe organ===\nThe pipe organ is located on the west wall in a timber frame.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} It was built by [[Wicklow]] native Kenneth Jones and installed in 1996.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}}\n\n==Stained glass windows==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = left\n | direction    = horizontal\n | header_align = \n | footer_align = \n | image1       = Harry Clarke (photo).jpg\n | width1       = 160\n | caption1     = Harry Clarke\n | image2       = Sarah Purser by John Butler Yeats.png\n | width2       = 138\n | caption2     = Sarah Purser\n}}\n\nThe chapel contains 19 stained glass windows. The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nThe panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to [[Paganism|pagan]] legend rather than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio (known as the \"The Tower of Glass\"),{{sfn|Rogers|1997|p=209}} where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing had to be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=210-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212-213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer. It is decorated with symbols the [[zodiac]],{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}} and images based on the mythological \"River of Life\",{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|Field|2006}} as well as depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes.<ref name=\"lel\" /> The designs celebrate the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the earth, and illustrate passages from the [[Old Testament]], including the \"[[Benedicite]]\" (also known as \"A Song of Creation\") from the [[Book of Daniel]], which was [[Laudate psalms|sung]] during the [[Lauds|office of lauds]] on Sundays and [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], as Jesus is traditionally thought to have risen from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the resurrection.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}{{sfn|Lawrence|1962|pp=289-296}} The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chapel of the Sacred Heart (Dingle)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.

More than 4,000 workers, of whom two thirds were [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese]], had laid more than {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} of track at altitudes above {{convert|7000|ft|abbr=on}}. In May 1869, the railheads of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific [[Rail transport|railroad]]s finally met at Promontory Summit, [[Utah Territory]].<ref name=\"WDL\" /> A specially-chosen Chinese and Irish crew had taken only 12 hours to lay the final {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} of track in time for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Chinese\">{{cite web|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Chinese.html|title=Chinese-American Contribution to Transcontinental Railroad|publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum|access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Golden Spike==\n{{Main|Golden spike}}\nPromontory Summit, Utah Territory had been agreed upon as the point where the two railheads would officially meet, following meetings in Washington, D.C. in April 1869,<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title=Ceremony at \"Wedding of the Rails,\" May 10, 1869 at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory |website=[[World Digital Library]] | date=1869-05-10 | access-date=2013-07-20 }}</ref> where it was also agreed that a ceremony would be held to drive in the [[golden spike|Last Spike]] to commemorate the occasion. However, the original date of May 8 had to be postponed for two days because of bad weather and a labor dispute on the Union Pacific side. Over 400 laid-off unpaid graders and tie cutters chained U.P.R.R. Vice-President Thomas Durant's dignitary railcar to a siding in Piedmont, Wyoming until he wired for money to pay them. After almost a two-day delay, when Durant's train arrived at the Devil's Gate Bridge in Wyoming, floodwaters turned a mild creek into a raging torrent, which threatened to collapse the railroad bridge. The engineer would not take his locomotive, whose number is lost to history, across the rickety structure, but he gave each of the passenger cars a hefty heave and they coasted across, but Durant no longer had a way to get to Promontory. A hasty telegraph to Ogden, Utah Territory sent Union Pacific's engine \"119\" to the rescue. After a hearty party in Ogden the night of May 9, the dignitaries arrived at Promontory Summit on the morning of May 10, where the Golden Spike Ceremony was finally planned and took place, with the last iron spike driven at 12:47 PM.\n \nThe trains carrying the railroads' officials were drawn by Union Pacific's ''[[Union Pacific No. 119|No. 119]]'' and Central Pacific's ''No. 60'' (officially named the ''[[Jupiter (locomotive)|Jupiter]]'') locomotives, neither of which had been originally chosen for the ceremony.  The Central Pacific had originally chosen their no. 29 ''Antelope'' to attend the ceremony, while the Union Pacific had also chosen another, unidentified engine for their train, but both engines encountered mishaps en route to the ceremony.  On May 10,<ref name=\"WDL\" /> the Jupiter and 119 were drawn up face-to-face on Promontory Summit, separated only by the width of a single tie. It is unknown how many people attended the event; estimates run from as low as 500 to as many as 3,000 government and railroad officials and track workers. Historians opine that the lack of Chinese workers seen in the official portrait was due to racism, since [[anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States]] prevailed over many decades including the late 1860s.  Their absence may have been the result of the timing of the famous photograph:  \n<blockquote>The more famous [[Andrew J. Russell|A.J. Russell]] photograph could not include the Chinese workers photographed earlier participating in the joining of the rails ceremony, because at the moment the famous photo was being taken it was after the conclusion of the ceremony and the Chinese workers were away from the two locomotives to dine at J.H. Strobridge's boarding car, being honored and cheered by the CPRR ([[Central Pacific Railroad]]) management.<ref name=\"Chinese\" /></blockquote>\nThree of the eight Chinese workers who brought up the last rail were guests of honor at the Promontory Summit's golden anniversary celebrations in Ogden, Utah in May 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Chinese_Laborers.html#1919|title=Chinese Laborers and the Construction of the Central Pacific|publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum|access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Last Spike 1869.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Last Spike'' by [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill]],  (1881)]]\nThe event at Promontory Summit was billed as the \"wedding of the rails\" and was officiated by the Reverend John Todd.<ref name=\"WDL\" /> Four precious metal spikes were ceremoniously driven (gently tapped with a special spike maul sporting a solid silver head into pre-drilled holes in the Laurelwood tie); one was the golden spike issued by Californian David Hewes, one was a second solid gold spike issued by the San Francisco Newsletter Newspaper, one was a solid silver spike issued by the State of Nevada, and one was an iron spike plated with silver on the shaft and gold on the top issued by Arizona Territory and presented by Arizona Territorial Governor Anson P.K.

Nobody tried to fully drive 17.6 Carat Solid Gold Spikes or any of the precious metal spikes into a wooden tie. Four holes had been drilled into the Laurelwood tie to \"hold\" the spikes while Stanford and UPRR's Thomas Durant gently tapped them before the Spikes and the Laurelwood Tie were removed to make way for a regular pine wood tie and four regular iron spikes, the last one was wired to the Transcontinental Telegraph Line. Stanford and Durant were supposed to strike the last iron spike with a regular iron spike hammer, also wired to the Telegraph Line, to send a signal from coast-to-coast as the job was done. Stanford missed the Spike, hitting the wooden tie instead; however, the telegraph operator hit his key as though Stanford had hit the spike. Durant missed the spike and the tie entirely; but likewise, the operator hit his key so the Nation would not know the difference. Then the operator sent the message D-O-N-E! With the railroad's completion, a trip across the Nation went from up to six months on foot, on an animal, or in an animal-pulled wagon to as little as eight days from New York, New York to San Francisco, California.\n\nPromontory Summit, Utah Territory marks the site where the First Transcontinental Railroad was officially completed, although a direct coast-to-coast rail journey on this route was not achieved until 1873.

More than 4,000 workers, of whom two thirds were [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese]], had laid more than {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} of track at altitudes above {{convert|7000|ft|abbr=on}}. In May 1869, the railheads of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific [[Rail transport|railroad]]s finally met at Promontory Summit, [[Utah Territory]].<ref name=\"WDL\" /> A specially-chosen Chinese and Irish crew had taken only 12 hours to lay the final {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} of track in time for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Chinese\">{{cite web|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Chinese.html|title=Chinese-American Contribution to Transcontinental Railroad|publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum|access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Golden Spike==\n{{Main|Golden spike}}\nPromontory Summit, Utah Territory had been agreed upon as the point where the two railheads would officially meet, following meetings in Washington, D.C. in April 1869,<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title=Ceremony at \"Wedding of the Rails,\" May 10, 1869 at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory |website=[[World Digital Library]] | date=1869-05-10 | access-date=2013-07-20 }}</ref> where it was also agreed that a ceremony would be held to drive in the [[golden spike|Last Spike]] to commemorate the occasion. However, the original date of May 8 had to be postponed for two days because of bad weather and a labor dispute on the Union Pacific side. Over 400 laid-off unpaid graders and tie cutters chained U.P.R.R. Vice-President Thomas Durant's dignitary railcar to a siding in Piedmont, Wyoming until he wired for money to pay them. After almost a two-day delay, when Durant's train arrived at the Devil's Gate Bridge in Wyoming, floodwaters turned a mild creek into a raging torrent, which threatened to collapse the railroad bridge. The engineer would not take his locomotive, whose number is lost to history, across the rickety structure, but he gave each of the passenger cars a hefty heave and they coasted across, but Durant no longer had a way to get to Promontory. A hasty telegraph to Ogden, Utah Territory sent Union Pacific's engine \"119\" to the rescue. After a hearty party in Ogden the night of May 9, the dignitaries arrived at Promontory Summit on the morning of May 10, where the Golden Spike Ceremony was finally planned and took place, with the last iron spike driven at 12:47 PM.\n \nThe trains carrying the railroads' officials were drawn by Union Pacific's ''[[Union Pacific No. 119|No. 119]]'' and Central Pacific's ''No. 60'' (officially named the ''[[Jupiter (locomotive)|Jupiter]]'') locomotives, neither of which had been originally chosen for the ceremony.  The Central Pacific had originally chosen their no. 29 ''Antelope'' to attend the ceremony, while the Union Pacific had also chosen another, unidentified engine for their train, but both engines encountered mishaps en route to the ceremony.  On May 10,<ref name=\"WDL\" /> the Jupiter and 119 were drawn up face-to-face on Promontory Summit, separated only by the width of a single tie. It is unknown how many people attended the event; estimates run from as low as 500 to as many as 3,000 government and railroad officials and track workers. Historians opine that the lack of Chinese workers seen in the official portrait was due to racism, since [[anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States]] prevailed over many decades including the late 1860s.  Their absence may have been the result of the timing of the famous photograph:  \n<blockquote>The more famous [[Andrew J. Russell|A.J. Russell]] photograph could not include the Chinese workers photographed earlier participating in the joining of the rails ceremony, because at the moment the famous photo was being taken it was after the conclusion of the ceremony and the Chinese workers were away from the two locomotives to dine at J.H. Strobridge's boarding car, being honored and cheered by the CPRR ([[Central Pacific Railroad]]) management.<ref name=\"Chinese\" /></blockquote>\nThree of the eight Chinese workers who brought up the last rail were guests of honor at the Promontory Summit's golden anniversary celebrations in Ogden, Utah in May 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Chinese_Laborers.html#1919|title=Chinese Laborers and the Construction of the Central Pacific|publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum|access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Last Spike 1869.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Last Spike'' by [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill]],  (1881)]]\nThe event at Promontory Summit was billed as the \"wedding of the rails\" and was officiated by the Reverend John Todd.<ref name=\"WDL\" /> Four precious metal spikes were ceremoniously driven (gently tapped with a special spike maul sporting a solid silver head into pre-drilled holes in the Laurelwood tie); one was the golden spike issued by Californian David Hewes, one was a second solid gold spike issued by the San Francisco Newsletter Newspaper, one was a solid silver spike issued by the State of Nevada, and one was an iron spike plated with silver on the shaft and gold on the top issued by Arizona Territory and presented by Arizona Territorial Governor Anson P.K.

Nobody tried to fully drive 17.6 Carat Solid Gold Spikes or any of the precious metal spikes into a wooden tie. Four holes had been drilled into the Laurelwood tie to \"hold\" the spikes while Standford and UPRR's Thomas Durant gently tapped them before the Spikes and the Laurelwood Tie were removed to make way for a regular pine wood tie and four regular iron spikes, the last one was wired to the Transcontinental Telegraph Line. Stanford and Durant were supposed to strike the last iron spike with a regular iron spike hammer, also wired to the Telegraph Line, to send a signal from coast-to-coast as the job was done. Stanford missed the Spike, hitting the wooden tie instead; however, the telegraph operator hit his key as though Stanford had hit the spike. Durant missed the spike and the tie entirely; but likewise, the operator hit his key so the Nation would not know the difference. Then the operator sent the message D-O-N-E!

It consists of nuns ([[Sannyasa|Sannyasinis]] and Brahmacharinis) belonging to a monastic order for women. It was formed as per the instructions given by [[Swami Vivekananda]], a patriot-saint of India.<ref>''Swami Vivekananda's Dream, Sri Sarada Math'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2005), p.7</ref> Fifty years after the passing away of Swami Vivekananda, in 1954, the Sri Sarada Math was established at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata with a group of eight nuns.\n\nThe headquarters of Sri Sarada Math is situated on the bank of Ganga in Dakshineshwar, Kolkata. Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52.

The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity.

He has toured without stop for 47 years, and is one of the most experienced and world traveled musicians in all of Texas music. Livingston's CD, ''Gypsy Alibi'', released by New Wilderness Records in 2011, won the \"Album of the Year\" at the Texas Music Awards. In January 2016, Livingston was inducted into the ''Texas Music Legends Hall of Fame'' and on October 3, 2018, Livingston will be inducted into the ''West Texas Music Walk of Fame''. Howlin' Dog Records released Livingston's latest CD, ''Up The Flatland Stairs'', January 10, 2018. \n\n==Early life==\nLivingston was born in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], but was raised in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. By the mid-1960s, he was active on the Lubbock music scene that was blossoming at the time along with several other Texas music artists such as [[Jimmy Dale Gilmore]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Butch Hancock]], [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]], [[Jesse Taylor]] and David Halley. Livingston sharpened his skills as a guitarist and singer while attending [[Lubbock High]] and [[Texas Tech University]]. In 1968, he opened a folk club in Lubbock called The Attic, and shortly afterwards left Lubbock to pursue his own career in music.<ref name=\"virtualubbock1\">{{cite web|author=Oglesby, Chris|url=http://www.virtualubbock.com/intBobLivingston.html|title=Chris Oglesby interviews with Bob Livingston|publisher=VirtualLubbock.com|date=2000-12-04|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>\n\n==American music career==\nOne of Livingston's first shows upon leaving Lubbock was to play for room, board and tips in [[Red River (New Mexico)|Red River]], [[New Mexico]]. There, he met a folk group called Three Faces West, whose members included Texas artist [[Ray Wylie Hubbard]], Rick Fowler and Wayne Kidd. While playing in [[Aspen]], [[Colorado]] in 1970, Livingston was discovered by talent scout and artist agent, Randy Fred, and was signed to [[Capitol Records]]. After meeting fellow Texas musician [[Michael Martin Murphey|Michael Murphey]] in California, Livingston moved to [[Wrightwood]], California and collaborated in a songwriting venture with Murphey, forming a music publishing company called Mountain Music Farm with other songwriters [[Roger Miller]] and [[Guy Clark]]. Livingston's Capitol Records contract was cancelled due to a company personnel change, and he subsequently opted to join Michael Murphey's band and play bass, touring and recording together on Murphey's classic albums [[Geronimo's Cadillac (Michael Martin Murphey album)|Geronimo's Cadillac]] and [[Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir]].<ref name=\"virtualubbock1\"/>\n\nBy 1971, Livingston had relocated to [[Austin]], Texas and was playing in a backing band that switched between Michael Murphey and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].<ref name=\"virtualubbock1\"/> \nEventually, Murphey and Walker's interchangeable band condensed into their own group, called [[Lost Gonzo Band|The Lost Gonzo Band]]. With Murphey and Walker, The Lost Gonzo Band helped bring about the [[progressive country]] genre, and along with the [[redneck rock]] and [[outlaw country]] movements, defined a distinct \"Austin Sound\". Livingston and the Lost Gonzo Band lent their talents to Jerry Jeff Walker for his seminal album [[Viva Terlingua]], among many other records in Walker's career.<ref name=\"txstate1\">{{cite web|author=Stimeling, Travis D.|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=jtmh|title=Viva Terlingua: Jerry Jeff Walker, Live Recordings, and the Authenticity of Progressive Country Music|publisher=Journal of Texas Music History, Vol. 8, No. 1|year=2008|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> Within time, the group achieved success in their own right and pursued a career for several years, signing contracts for three albums with Capitol Records and [[MCA Records|MCA]].

Beginning in 1987, Livingston began a series of music tours sponsored by the [[U.S. State Department]]. Acting as an ambassador of American music, he has been sent repeatedly to over 25 different countries throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr122607.html |title=Embassy of the United States Hanoi, Vietnam - 2007 Press Releases |publisher=Vietnam.usembassy.gov |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527110517/http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr122607.html |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> with an aim to promote goodwill and cross-cultural understanding through musical exchange. Livingston has toured [[Yemen]], [[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Angola]], among others. These tours began as a solo act, but eventually included such musicians as long-time associate and guitarist John Inmon, fiddler [[Richard Bowden]], and Livingston's son, guitarist and composer, Tucker Livingston. Livingston and his son gave performances and workshops on the art of guitar playing, songwriting craft, and a history of Texas music and [[folklore]]. The Livingstons regularly invited local musicians onstage to collaborate with their indigenous instruments. What followed were concerts that demonstrated to public, school and state audiences alike a sense of unity and brotherhood through music. Editing and pre-production of a documentary film of these travels are currently in the works. Though Livingston plays original music on these tours, he also teaches audiences around the world how to [[yodel]], sing [[Hank Williams]] songs, and perform [[Buddy Holly|Buddy Holly's]] \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" yielding a kaleidoscope of imagery that they have seldom encountered. Livingston has played and collaborated with groups as diverse as Nepal's, Sur Sudha, The Royal [[Omani]] Orchestra, with [[Ood]] players in the Middle East, [[Geisha]] singers in Vietnam, [[sitar]] and [[tabla]] players in India and [[Angola]]n drum and choir ensembles.<ref>{{cite web|author=Langer, Andy|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/print.html?oid=oid:158112|title=Big in Yemen|publisher=Austin Chronicle|date=2003-05-02|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng/news/default.aspx?cat_id=513&news_id=5173 |title=HCM City People's Committee |publisher=Eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726175953/http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng/news/default.aspx?cat_id=513&news_id=5173 |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Texas Music International (TMI) and Cowboys & Indians==\nIn 2000, Livingston created his own company, Texas Music International, an organization dedicated to bringing different musics of the world together for human and cultural [[harmony]]. His first venture was to create a multi-cultural group of musicians from Texas and India called Cowboys & Indians.

He has toured without stop for 47 years, and is one of the most experienced and world traveled musicians in all of Texas music.

By the mid-1960s, he was active on the Lubbock music scene that was blossoming at the time along with several other Texas music artists such as [[Jimmy Dale Gilmore]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Butch Hancock]], [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]], [[Jesse Taylor]] and David Halley. Livingston sharpened his skills as a guitarist and singer while attending [[Lubbock High]] and [[Texas Tech University]]. In 1968, he opened a folk club in Lubbock called The Attic, and shortly afterwards left Lubbock to pursue his own career in music.<ref name=\"virtualubbock1\">{{cite web|author=Oglesby, Chris|url=http://www.virtualubbock.com/intBobLivingston.html|title=Chris Oglesby interviews with Bob Livingston|publisher=VirtualLubbock.com|date=2000-12-04|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>\n\n==American music career==\nOne of Livingston's first shows upon leaving Lubbock was to play for room, board and tips in [[Red River (New Mexico)|Red River]], [[New Mexico]]. There, he met a folk group called Three Faces West, whose members included Texas artist [[Ray Wylie Hubbard]], Rick Fowler and Wayne Kidd. While playing in [[Aspen]], [[Colorado]] in 1970, Livingston was discovered by talent scout and artist agent, Randy Fred, and was signed to [[Capitol Records]]. After meeting fellow Texas musician [[Michael Martin Murphey|Michael Murphey]] in California, Livingston moved to [[Wrightwood]], California and collaborated in a songwriting venture with Murphey, forming a music publishing company called Mountain Music Farm with other songwriters [[Roger Miller]] and [[Guy Clark]]. Livingston's Capitol Records contract was cancelled due to a company personnel change, and he subsequently opted to join Michael Murphey's band and play bass, touring and recording together on Murphey's classic albums [[Geronimo's Cadillac (Michael Martin Murphey album)|Geronimo's Cadillac]] and [[Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir]].<ref name=\"virtualubbock1\"/>\n\nBy 1971, Livingston had relocated to [[Austin]], Texas and was playing in a backing band that switched between Michael Murphey and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].<ref name=\"virtualubbock1\"/> \nEventually, Murphey and Walker's interchangeable band condensed into their own group, called [[Lost Gonzo Band|The Lost Gonzo Band]]. With Murphey and Walker, The Lost Gonzo Band helped bring about the [[progressive country]] genre, and along with the [[redneck rock]] and [[outlaw country]] movements, defined a distinct \"Austin Sound\". Livingston and the Lost Gonzo Band lent their talents to Jerry Jeff Walker for his seminal album [[Viva Terlingua]], among many other records in Walker's career.<ref name=\"txstate1\">{{cite web|author=Stimeling, Travis D.|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=jtmh|title=Viva Terlingua: Jerry Jeff Walker, Live Recordings, and the Authenticity of Progressive Country Music|publisher=Journal of Texas Music History, Vol. 8, No. 1|year=2008|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> Within time, the group achieved success in their own right and pursued a career for several years, signing contracts for three albums with Capitol Records and [[MCA Records|MCA]].

Livingston has toured [[Yemen]], [[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Angola]], among others. These tours began as a solo act, but eventually included such musicians as long-time associate and guitarist John Inmon, fiddler [[Richard Bowden]], and Livingston's son, guitarist and composer, Tucker Livingston. Livingston and his son gave performances and workshops on the art of guitar playing, songwriting craft, and a history of Texas music and [[folklore]]. The Livingstons regularly invited local musicians onstage to collaborate with their indigenous instruments. What followed were concerts that demonstrated to public, school and state audiences alike a sense of unity and brotherhood through music. Editing and pre-production of a documentary film of these travels are currently in the works. Though Livingston plays original music on these tours, he also teaches audiences around the world how to [[yodel]], sing [[Hank Williams]] songs, and perform [[Buddy Holly|Buddy Holly's]] \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" yielding a kaleidoscope of imagery that they have seldom encountered. Livingston has played and collaborated with groups as diverse as Nepal's, Sur Sudha, The Royal [[Omani]] Orchestra, with [[Ood]] players in the Middle East, [[Geisha]] singers in Vietnam, [[sitar]] and [[tabla]] players in India and [[Angola]]n drum and choir ensembles.<ref>{{cite web|author=Langer, Andy|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/print.html?oid=oid:158112|title=Big in Yemen|publisher=Austin Chronicle|date=2003-05-02|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng/news/default.aspx?cat_id=513&news_id=5173 |title=HCM City People's Committee |publisher=Eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726175953/http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng/news/default.aspx?cat_id=513&news_id=5173 |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Texas Music International (TMI) and Cowboys & Indians==\nIn 2000, Livingston created his own company, Texas Music International, an organization dedicated to bringing different musics of the world together for human and cultural [[harmony]].
