In 1817 he became a Benedictine, and from that time continued his studies at the schools of that order, where he was known by his Latin name {{lang|la|Stephanus Anianus}}. He lectured at [[Benedictine]] schools up to 1839, then for 40 years at the Budapest University of Sciences department of physics-mechanics. Few guessed at that time that his activities would play an important part in bringing up a new generation of physicists. He became the dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1848, and by 1863 he was rector of the University. From 1858 he was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and from 1873 was an honorary member. After his retirement, he continued working and spent his last years in complete seclusion at the priory in [[Gy\u0151r]], where he died.\n\n==Scientific work==\n[[File:Jedlik motor.jpg|thumb|right|Jedlik's \"lightning-magnetic self-rotor\", 1827 (the world's first [[electric motor]])]]\n[[File:Cs\u00f6ves_vill\u00e1mfesz\u00edt\u0151.png|thumb|Jedlik's tubular voltage generator, which is probably the earliest [[impulse generator]]]]\nIn 1827, Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic rotating devices which he called ''lightning-magnetic self-rotors'', and in 1828 he demonstrated the first device which contained the three main components of practical [[direct current]] [[DC electric motor|motors]]: the [[stator]], [[Armature (electrical engineering)|rotor]], and [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book\n|title=Electricity and magnetism, translated from the French of Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Guillemin\n|place=London\n|publisher=MacMillan\n|year=1891\n|editor-last=Thompson\n|editor-first=Silvanus P.}}</ref><ref name=\"Nature\">{{cite journal\n|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n|title=Anianus Jedlik\n|first=Augustus |last=Heller\n|publisher=Norman Lockyer\n|date=April 1896\n|volume=53\n|issue=1379\n|page=516\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWojdmTmch0C&pg=PA516\n|accessdate=August 23, 2010\n|bibcode = 1896Natur..53..516H |doi = 10.1038/053516a0 }}</ref><ref name=\"mpoweruk.com\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mpoweruk.com/timeline.htm\n|title=Technology and Applications Timeline\n|accessdate=August 23, 2010\n|date=May 28, 2010\n|publisher=Electropaedia\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.fh-zwickau.de/mbk/kfz_ee/praesentationen/Elma-Gndl-Generator%20-%20Druckversion.pdf\n |accessdate  = August 23, 2010\n |date        = March 22, 2009\n |title       = Elektrische Maschinen in Kraftfahrzeugen\n |trans-title = Electrical machinery in motor vehicles\n |last        = Thein\n |first       = M.\n |publisher   = Falkutat der Kraftfahrzeugen\n |location    = Zwickau\n |language    = German\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130914192636/http://www.fh-zwickau.de/mbk/kfz_ee/praesentationen/Elma-Gndl-Generator%20-%20Druckversion.pdf\n |archivedate = September 14, 2013\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |url         = http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_I/Philosophie/Wissenschaftsgeschichte/Termine/E-Maschinen-Lexikon/Chronologie.htm\n |title       = Elektrisiermaschinen im 18. und 19.

In 1845, Jedlik was the first university professor in the Kingdom of Hungary who began teaching his students in Hungarian instead of [[Latin]]. His cousin [[Gergely Czuczor]], a Hungarian linguist, asked him to create a Hungarian technical vocabulary in physics, the first of its kind, by which he became one of its founders.\n\nIn the 1850s he conducted optical and wave-mechanical experiments, and at the beginning of the 1860s, he constructed an excellent optical grate.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nHe was ahead of his contemporaries in his scientific work, but he did not speak about his most important invention, his prototype [[dynamo]], until 1856; it was not until 1861 that he mentioned it in writing in a list of inventory of the university. Although that document might serve as evidence of Jedlik's being the first dynamo, the invention of the dynamo is linked to [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Siemens]]'s name because Jedlik's invention did not rise to notice at that time.\n\nIn 1863 he discovered the possibility of voltage multiplication and in 1868 demonstrated it with a \"tubular voltage generator\", which was successfully displayed at the [[Vienna World Exposition]] in 1873.<ref>{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html\n |title       = Innovators and Innovations\n |last        = Sipka\n |first       = L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n |date        = Summer 2001\n |accessdate  = August 23, 2010\n |issue       = 162\n |volume      = XLII\n |journal     = [[Hungarian Quarterly]]\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095831/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html\n |archivedate = June 15, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> It was an early form of the [[impulse generator]]s now applied in nuclear research.<ref>{{cite book |title      = The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture\n |chapter    = 42.

Most stops are {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon.

However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory. Although \u00a3100m from TfL was initially secured in the draft 2016/17 budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.TfL_commits___100m_to_extending_tram_network_from_Wimbledon_to_Sutton/|title=TfL commits \u00a3100m to extending tram network from Wimbledon to Sutton|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> this was subsequently reallocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/100million-tram-link-between-croydon-and-sutton-in-doubt-as-mayor-of-london-shelves-funding/story-29969181-detail/story.html|title=Why Croydon's tram network may now not be extended to Sutton|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> The current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]] remains committed to the project however, and has called on the council to raise the shortfall in funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14504564.Sadiq_Khan__Tram_extension_is_a_priority____but_don_t_hold_your_breath_/|title=Sadiq Khan: Tram extension is a priority - 'but don't hold your breath'|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/15043498._Show_more_ambition___Sutton_to_review_tram_extension_funding_as_Mayor_calls_on_council_to_pledge_more_money/|title='Show more ambition': Sutton to review tram extension funding as Mayor calls on council to pledge more money|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> It has been announced \u00a370m from the Mayor's Growth Fund had been allocated to the extension with a potential further \u00a330m being available in the next Tfl Business plan, subject to an acceptable business case and funding package being reached by 2020.<ref>http://content.tfl.gov.uk/pic-20171212-item08-growth-fund.pdf</ref><ref>https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s61496/Sutton%20Tram%20Update%20Report.pdf</ref> An additional \u00a350m has also been offered by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.tfl-commits-100m-to-extending-tram-network-from-wimbledon-to-sutton/</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2018, a TfL consultation opened on proposals for rapid transit between Sutton and Merton.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\">https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/trams/sutton-link/</ref> The consultation proposed three potential routes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#!! Northern terminus!! Route\n|-\n|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory\n|}\n\nIt has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost \u00a3425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at \u00a3275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that \"The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively\"<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713203635/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf |date=13 July 2009 }}</ref> and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Extension!!

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.

It continues along the former railway route to near Sandilands where Tramlink curves sharply towards Sandilands tram stop. Another route from Sandilands tram stop curves sharply on to the W&SCR before passing through Park Hill (or Sandilands) tunnels and to the site of [[Coombe Road railway station]] after which it curves away across [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]].\n\nTramlink follows the former [[West Croydon to Wimbledon Line]], which was first opened in 1855 and closed on 31 May 1997 to allow for conversion into Tramlink.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=2002 |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=148 |page=51 |issn=0033-8923}}</ref> Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, Tramlink follows the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], giving Tramlink a claim to one of the world's oldest railway alignments \u2013 {{gbmapscaled|TQ273680|300|Tramway Path}} beside Mitcham tram stop.

As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nIn January 2011, Tramtrack Croydon opened a tender for the supply of ten new or second-hand trams from the end of summer 2011, for use between Therapia Lane and Elmers End.<ref name=rgltsbfat>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |title=London Tramlink seeks bids for additional trams |date=31 January 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102131738/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html |archivedate=2 November 2012  }}</ref><ref>Rail Magazine page 16, 'News in Brief \u2013 New Trams for Croydon' Issue 663, 9 \u2013 22 February 2011</ref><ref name=rgi20110818/> On 18 August 2011, TfL announced that [[Stadler Rail]] had won a $19.75 million contract to supply six [[Variotram|Variobahn]] trams similar to those used by [[Bergen Light Rail|Bybanen]] in [[Bergen]], Norway.<ref name=rgi20110818>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |title=Stadler wins London Tramlink tram order |date=18 August 2011 |magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917051215/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-london-tramlink-tram-order.html |archivedate=17 September 2011  }}</ref> They entered service in 2012.<ref name=RailwayGazette21Aug13>[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html London Tramlink orders more Stadlet trams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103134936/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/london-tramlink-orders-more-stadler-trams.html |date=3 January 2017 }} ''Railway Gazette'' 21 August 2013</ref> In August 2013, TfL ordered an additional four Variotrams for delivery in 2015, for use on the Wimbledon to Croydon link, an order which was later increased to six.

Most stops are {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon.

However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory. Although \u00a3100m from TfL was initially secured in the draft 2016/17 budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.TfL_commits___100m_to_extending_tram_network_from_Wimbledon_to_Sutton/|title=TfL commits \u00a3100m to extending tram network from Wimbledon to Sutton|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> this was subsequently reallocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/100million-tram-link-between-croydon-and-sutton-in-doubt-as-mayor-of-london-shelves-funding/story-29969181-detail/story.html|title=Why Croydon's tram network may now not be extended to Sutton|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> The current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]] remains committed to the project however, and has called on the council to raise the shortfall in funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14504564.Sadiq_Khan__Tram_extension_is_a_priority____but_don_t_hold_your_breath_/|title=Sadiq Khan: Tram extension is a priority - 'but don't hold your breath'|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/15043498._Show_more_ambition___Sutton_to_review_tram_extension_funding_as_Mayor_calls_on_council_to_pledge_more_money/|title='Show more ambition': Sutton to review tram extension funding as Mayor calls on council to pledge more money|website=Sutton Guardian}}</ref> It has been announced \u00a370m from the Mayor's Growth Fund had been allocated to the extension with a potential further \u00a330m being available in the next Tfl Business plan, subject to an acceptable business case and funding package being reached by 2020.<ref>http://content.tfl.gov.uk/pic-20171212-item08-growth-fund.pdf</ref><ref>https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s61496/Sutton%20Tram%20Update%20Report.pdf</ref> An additional \u00a350m has also been offered by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.tfl-commits-100m-to-extending-tram-network-from-wimbledon-to-sutton/</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2018, a TfL consultation opened on proposals for rapid transit between Sutton and Merton.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\">https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/trams/sutton-link/</ref> The consultation proposed three potential routes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#!! Northern terminus!! Route\n|-\n|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory\n|}\n\nIt has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost \u00a3425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at \u00a3275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that \"The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively\"<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713203635/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf |date=13 July 2009 }}</ref> and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Extension!!

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.
