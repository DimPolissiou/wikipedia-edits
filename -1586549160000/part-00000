In the northernmost corner of the county (''i.e.'', the originally Norwegian parishes of [[S\u00e4rna]] and [[Idre]]), a characteristic dialect reminiscent of eastern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is spoken. Otherwise, the different Dalecarlians can be regarded as Swedish and join the Swedish dialect group in [[G\u00e4strikland]], [[Uppland]], and northern and eastern [[V\u00e4stmanland]]. They also show some similarities with the dialects of the other counties bordering Dalarna. One usually distinguishes between the [[Dalecarlian mountain dialects]], which are spoken in south-eastern Dalarna, and {{ill|Dalecarlian proper|sv|De egentliga dalm\u00e5len}}.<ref>Bengt Pamp, Svenska dialekter, Lund 1978, sid. 111</ref>\n\n== Geographical distribution of Dalecarlian proper ==\nDalecarlian dialects are generally classified geographically:\n*'''[[Ovansiljan]], north of the [[Siljan (lake)|Siljan lake]]:''' [[socken]]s [[Ore socken|Ore]], [[Orsa socken|Orsa]], [[V\u00e5mhus socken|V\u00e5mhus]], [[\u00c4lvdalens socken|\u00c4lvdalen]] ([[Elfdalian dialect]]), [[Mora socken|Mora]], [[Venjans socken|Venjan]], [[Soller\u00f6ns socken|Soller\u00f6n]].\n*'''[[Nedansiljan]], south of the [[Siljan (lake)|Siljan lake]]:''' sockens [[Boda socken, Dalarna|Boda]], [[R\u00e4ttviks socken|R\u00e4ttvik]], [[Bjurs\u00e5s socken|Bjurs\u00e5s]], [[\u00c5ls socken|\u00c5l]], [[Siljansn\u00e4s socken|Siljansn\u00e4s]], [[Leksands socken|Leksand]], [[Gagnefs socken|Gagnef]].\n*'''Upper [[V\u00e4sterdalarna]]:''' sockens [[Lima socken|Lima]], [[Transtrands socken|Transtrand]]. \n*'''Lower V\u00e4sterdalarna:''' sockens [[Malungs socken|Malung]], [[\u00c4ppelbo socken|\u00c4ppelbo]], [[J\u00e4rna socken|J\u00e4rna]], [[N\u00e5s socken|N\u00e5s]], [[Floda socken, Dalarna|Floda]], the [[parish]]es of [[Mockfj\u00e4rds f\u00f6rsamling|Mockfj\u00e4rd]] in Gagnefs socken.\n*''Floda'' and ''Mockfj\u00e4rd'' can be considered as a separate group.\n\nVery independent are Dalecarlian proper (especially in \u00c4lvdalen, Mora and Orsa, to some extent also in Ore, R\u00e4ttvik and Leksand), as well as western Dalecarlian. [[Elfdalian]] is the one of the Dalecarlian dialects that best kept their older features. This dialect attracted research early on, as it deviated very significantly from other Swedish dialects. In many ways, it is very archaic. In other ways, it has distinguished itself from the ancient language and developed special features that are rare in other languages. A characteristic for the \"Dalecarlian dialect\" is a pronounced split in a number of narrowly limited and easily distinguishable local dialects, which often only cover a single village or even part of a village.\n\nFor strangers, Dalecarlian is virtually incomprehensible without special studies. However, this does not apply to the same extent about the R\u00e4ttvik and Leksand dialects. They are more easily understood and can be considered to form a transition from the more archaic dialects. Such transition goals are also the goals of \u00c5l, Bjurs\u00e5s and Gagnef. The Gagnef dialect approaches the western Dalecarlian dialects, which to some extent can also be regarded as transitional dialects, but which in many respects take on a more independent position, especially in the upper parishes. They may show similarities with neighbouring [[Norwegian dialects]].\n\nFrom Gagnef, the leap is quite large to the [[Stora Tuna socken|Stora Tuna]] dialect, which belongs to the [[Dalarna mountain dialects]], a relatively uniform and fairly normal Swedish dialect complex that covers the entire southern Dalarna ([[Stora Kopparbergs socken|Stora Kopparberg]], [[Hedemora socken|Hedemora]] and [[V\u00e4sterbergslagen]]). The most deviant within this complex are the [[Sv\u00e4rdsj\u00f6 socken|Sv\u00e4rdsj\u00f6]] and western mountain dialects, which are approaching [[H\u00e4lsingem\u00e5l]] and the western Dalecarlian language (over [[Grang\u00e4rde socken|Grang\u00e4rde]] and [[Floda socken, Dalarna|Floda]]). Mountain dialects are also spoken in the northern part of [[V\u00e4stmanland]]. The mountain dialects connect quite closely with neighbouring [[Uppsala dialects]], perhaps most with Eastern V\u00e4stmanland's dialects.\n\nIn everyday speech, many with ''Dalecarlian'' often also refer to regionally coloured \"national languages\" from Dalarna, that is, a lexical and morphologically \"nationally\" Swedish with a Dalarna characteristic [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In [[linguistics]], one distinguishes between regionally coloured [[national language]]s and genuine dialects, and ''Dalecarlian'' is used exclusively for dialects in the latter sense.\n\n== Dalecarlian phonology ==\nAs with most dialects in northern and central Sweden, the Dalecarlian dialects have a supradental heavy-''r'' and a cachuminal (with the tip of the tongue towards the trough) have thick-''l''. However, superdental numbers are more limited than usual, for example, ''rs'' often becomes ''ss'' (for example, Dalecarlian ''koss'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''kors'', [[English language|English]] ''cross''), ''rn'' in southern Dalarna becomes ''r'' (for example, Dalecarlian ''bar'', Swedish ''barn'', English ''child'', Dalecarlian ''bj\u00f6r'', Swedish ''bj\u00f6rn'', English ''bear'', up to and including R\u00e4ttvik, Leksand and V\u00e4sterdalarna). In Dalecarlian proper is often ''nn'', and ''rt'', ''rd'' preserved without assimilation (from Gagnef northwards). ''l'' is not usually cachuminal after ''i'' and ''e'', except in Dalecarlian proper, which in the case of ''l'' has gone its own way and can even partially use cachuminal ''l'' at the beginning of words, for example ''l''\u00e5ta. Dalecarlian has, in the usual way, lost -''n'' and, as a rule, -''t'' in unstressed endings, for example, Dalecarlian ''sola'' or ''sole'', Swedish ''solen'', English ''sun'', Dalecarlian ''g\u00e2tu'', Swedish ''gatan'', English ''street'', Dalecarlian ''biti'', Swedish ''bitit'', English ''bitten''. Like other Upper Swedish dialects, they often have ''i'' in endings for the national languages ''e'', for example Dalecarlian ''funnin'', Swedish ''funnen'', English ''found'', Dalecarlian ''muli'', Swedish ''mulet'', English ''cloudy'', Dalecarlian ''h\u00e4rvil'', Swedish ''h\u00e4rvel'', English ''h\u00e4rvel'' (winding yarn on), has g-sounds, not j, in ''rg'' and ''lg'', for example Dalecarlian and Swedish ''varg'', English ''wolf'', long vowel in front of ''m'' in many words, where the national language has short, for example Dalecarlian ''tima'', Swedish ''timme'', English ''hour'', Dalecarlian ''t\u00f6m'', Swedish ''tom'', English ''empty''. ''j'' has not disappeared without trace after ''k'', ''g'' in words such as Dalecarlian ''\u00e4ntja'', Swedish ''\u00e4nka'', English ''widow'', Dalecarlian ''bryddja'', Swedish ''brygga'', English ''bridge''. As in the northern Swedes and in the northern dialects, ''g'', ''k'' have also been softened to ''tj'', (d) ''j'', for example Dalecarlian ''s\u00e4ttjin'' or ''s\u00e4ttjen'', Swedish ''s\u00e4cken'', English ''bag'', Dalecarlian ''botja'' or ''botje'' Swedish ''boken'', English ''book'', Dalecarlian ''nyttjil'', Swedish ''nyckel'', English ''key''. These traits characterise all Dalecarlian dialects.\n\nCharacteristic of the vocal system in especially Upper Dalarna, with the exception of Dalecarlian proper, is the use of open and end ''a'', which is used in a completely different way than in the national language: the open can occur as far and the closed as short, for example ''hara'' hare with open ''a'' in first, end in second syllable, ''katt'', ''bakka'', ''vagn'' with end, ''skabb'', ''kalv'' with open ''a''; open ''\u00e5'' sound (o) is often replaced by a sound between ''\u00e5'' and ''\u00f6''; The ''u'' sound has a sound similar to the Norwegian ''u''; ''\u00e4'' and ''e'' are well separated; the low-pitched vocals often have a sound of ''\u00e4''. Among the most interesting features of the dialects in \u00c4lvdalen, Mora and Orsa is that they still largely retain the nasal vocal sounds that were previously found in all Nordic dialects. Furthermore, it is noticed that the long ''i'', ''y'', ''u'' diphthongs, usually to ''ai'', ''\u00e5y'', ''au'', for example Dalecarlian ''ais'', Swedish ''is'' English ''ice'', Dalecarlian ''kn\u00e5yta'', Swedish ''knyta'', English ''tie'', Dalecarlian ''aute'', Swedish ''ute'', English ''out''. ''v'' has the [[Old Norse]] pronunciation ''w'' (like ''w'' in English)<ref>Elias Wess\u00e9n, Svensk spr\u00e5khistoria (\u00e5ttonde upplagan), del 1, Lund 1969, sid. 37-38</ref>, ''l'' is usually omitted in front of ''g'', ''k'', ''p'', ''v'', for example, Dalecarlian ''k\u00e5v'', Swedish ''kalf'', English ''calf'', Dalecarlian ''fok'' and such Swedish ''folk'', English ''folk, people''. ''h'' is omitted, for example, Dalecarlian ''and'', Swedish and English ''hand'' (in the \u00c4lvdals-, Orsa- and Mora dialects, as well as in R\u00e4ttvik and parts of Leksand). In the same way, many words have been added as h:n such as ''h\u00e4ven'', ''h\u00e4lsklig'', ''h\u00e4gde''. These features have the common Dalecarlian in common with the older Uppland dialects.\n\nA pair of ancient Nordic diphthongs remain in the western Dalecarlian dialects in Lima and Transtrand. The diphthong ''au'', which in the Swedish state has pronounced ''\u00f6'', has in these areas a slightly changed form, ''\u00f4u'', for example ''d\u00f4u'' (Swedish ''d\u00f6d'', English ''death''). The ancient Swedish diphthongs ''ei'' and ''\u00f6y'' (which in Swedish became ''e'' and ''\u00f6'' respectively) have been pronounced ''\u00e4i'', for example ''sk\u00e4i'' (Swedish ''sked'', English ''Spoon'') and ''here'' (Swedish ''h\u00f6'', English ''hay''), respectively.<ref> Nationalencyklopedin, band 4, sid. 352 </ref>\n\n== Dalecarlian morphology  ==\nIn the '' form theory '' in the valley target in southern Dalarna (mainly in the rock stroke), weak five are noticed. on - '' u '': '' vikku '' week, '' fly '' fly, '' ladu '' e1. '' sound '' barn (on the other hand '' wrap '', if the stem has a '' long '' sound), weak mask. on - '' a '': '' hara '', '' staka '', '' tray ''. Certain shapes are mask. '' boat '' boat, '' tidy '' (south Dalarna to Gagnef) electricity. '' clear '' back, five. '' sunbathing '', '' botja '' (southern Dalarna through parts of Leksand and V\u00e4sterdalarna), '' sole '', '' botje '' (\"valley goal\"), mask. '' haran '' el. '' harn '' the haren, five. '' wick '' week, neutr. '' houses '' house, '' tatji '' (southern Dalarna to Gagnef) or '' tatje '' roof; obese. plur. and strong five. - '' are '', for example '' horses '' horses (less often '' horses ''), '' socks '' parishes, '' priests '' (el. '' priests '') priests, weak five . - '' from '' (most southern Dalarna), for example '' flickering '' girls, neutr. '' tak '' tak, '' ditjen '' dikes (d: o). Best. plur. '' the horse (\u00e4) '', '' the priest (\u00e4) '' (southern Dalarna up against Tuna and Falun) el. '' the horse '' (north of Falun), '' the sock (\u00e4) '' el. '' socknan '', '' flicker (\u00e4) '' (south D.), '' flicker '' el. '' flick con '' (northbound).\n\nIn Upper Dalarna, the declension has developed a peculiar development, in particular through the coincidence of different types of declension. In parts of Gagnef, for example, almost all nouns have the same inflection in plur: \"\" chorus \"\" men, \"\" chick \"\" girls, \"\" baror \"\" children, \"\" apple laurel \"\" apples; Requests. f. '' the guy, the flick, the baran, the apple ''. Instead, at least the \"valley goal\" (including parts of Leksand and Djura) and the western valley goals have preserved the old case-inflection, in particular the dative forms, for example \"\" in bu (d) about \"\" and d. In the sheds. (Also, otherwise, these many age-old features in terms of word-bending - as in the sound system - show, but these are not described here.)\n\nIn the adjective inflection in southern Dalarna, plural is used without endings, for example '' all hands '' all hands, '' many walks '' many times, adj. on - '' in '': '' rolin '' calm, on '' u (g) '': '' toku (g) '' tokig. Me, you, are usually called \"\" mug, dough, say \"\", \"\" springtime, andr\u00e5m \"\" (southern Dalarna) are five. of ours, another. Verbs often lose - '' a '' in infinitive, for example '' running race, tar horses ''. Caste and similar verbs have in the present '' chestnut '' as well as '' encounter '' encounter. The imperfect is usually called '' throw ''. It is called '' where, where '' electricity. '' vuri '' been, '' havi '' el. '' h\u00e4vi '' had, '' been, wurti '' became, became.\n\nIn Upper Dalarna the verb inflection is peculiarly developed, in the actual valley goal it is in some respects very old-fashioned. Regarding the vocabulary, a large number of peculiar and otherwise rare words are noticed, especially in the upper parishes.\n\nIn southern Dalarna it is more normal. The moon is everywhere called '' the moon '' and spring is called '' the box '' (cf. Gotlandian '' the charge ''!), Words that include. a. Used by Dalarna's skull, Erik Axel Karlfeldt. '' Itji '' el. '' tji '' can be used instead of '' not ''. Adverbs on - '' e '' usually end in - '' a '': '' inna, nera, \u00f4ppa '' as in V\u00e4stmanland and G\u00e4strikland. '' Mil '' is neutrum and '' trolley '' feminimum. The name tag is characteristic: the old farm names are used as family names and put before the baptismal name, for example Back P\u00e4r Erssa.\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Adolf Noreen \"Dalm\u00e5let.

In the northernmost corner of the county, i.e. the originally Norwegian parishes of [[S\u00e4rna]] and [[Idre]], a characteristic dialect reminiscent of eastern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is spoken. Otherwise, the different Dalecarlians can be regarded as Swedish and join the Swedish dialect group in [[G\u00e4strikland]], [[Uppland]], and northern and eastern [[V\u00e4stmanland]]. They also show some similarities with the dialects of the other counties bordering Dalarna. One usually distinguishes between the [[Dalecarlian mountain dialects]], which are spoken in south-eastern Dalarna, and {{ill|Dalecarlian proper|sv|De egentliga dalm\u00e5len}}.<ref>Bengt Pamp, Svenska dialekter, Lund 1978, sid. 111</ref>\n\n== Geographical distribution of Dalecarlian proper ==\nDalecarlian dialects are generally classified geographically:\n*'''[[Ovansiljan]], north of the [[Siljan (lake)|Siljan lake]]:''' [[socken]]s [[Ore socken|Ore]], [[Orsa socken|Orsa]], [[V\u00e5mhus socken|V\u00e5mhus]], [[\u00c4lvdalens socken|\u00c4lvdalen]] ([[Elfdalian dialect]]), [[Mora socken|Mora]], [[Venjans socken|Venjan]], [[Soller\u00f6ns socken|Soller\u00f6n]].\n*'''[[Nedansiljan]], south of the [[Siljan (lake)|Siljan lake]]:''' sockens [[Boda socken, Dalarna|Boda]], [[R\u00e4ttviks socken|R\u00e4ttvik]], [[Bjurs\u00e5s socken|Bjurs\u00e5s]], [[\u00c5ls socken|\u00c5l]], [[Siljansn\u00e4s socken|Siljansn\u00e4s]], [[Leksands socken|Leksand]], [[Gagnefs socken|Gagnef]].\n*'''Upper [[V\u00e4sterdalarna]]:''' sockens [[Lima socken|Lima]], [[Transtrands socken|Transtrand]]. \n*'''Lower V\u00e4sterdalarna:''' sockens [[Malungs socken|Malung]], [[\u00c4ppelbo socken|\u00c4ppelbo]], [[J\u00e4rna socken|J\u00e4rna]], [[N\u00e5s socken|N\u00e5s]], [[Floda socken, Dalarna|Floda]], the [[parish]]es of [[Mockfj\u00e4rds f\u00f6rsamling|Mockfj\u00e4rd]] in Gagnefs socken.\n*''Floda'' and ''Mockfj\u00e4rd'' can be considered as a separate group.\n\nVery independent are Dalecarlian proper (especially in \u00c4lvdalen, Mora and Orsa, to some extent also in Ore, R\u00e4ttvik and Leksand), as well as western Dalecarlian. [[Elfdalian]] is the one of the Dalecarlian dialects that best kept their older features. This dialect attracted research early on, as it deviated very significantly from other Swedish dialects. In many ways, it is very archaic. In other ways, it has distinguished itself from the ancient language and developed special features that are rare in other languages. A characteristic for the \"Dalecarlian dialect\" is a pronounced split in a number of narrowly limited and easily distinguishable local dialects, which often only cover a single village or even part of a village.\n\nFor strangers, Dalecarlian is virtually incomprehensible without special studies. However, this does not apply to the same extent about the R\u00e4ttvik and Leksand dialects. They are more easily understood and can be considered to form a transition from the more archaic dialects. Such transition goals are also the goals of \u00c5l, Bjurs\u00e5s and Gagnef. The Gagnef dialect approaches the western Dalecarlian dialects, which to some extent can also be regarded as transitional dialects, but which in many respects take on a more independent position, especially in the upper parishes. They may show similarities with neighbouring [[Norwegian dialects]].\n\nFrom Gagnef, the leap is quite large to the [[Stora Tuna socken|Stora Tuna]] dialect, which belongs to the [[Dalarna mountain dialects]], a relatively uniform and fairly normal Swedish dialect complex that covers the entire southern Dalarna ([[Stora Kopparbergs socken|Stora Kopparberg]], [[Hedemora socken|Hedemora]] and [[V\u00e4sterbergslagen]]). The most deviant within this complex are the [[Sv\u00e4rdsj\u00f6 socken|Sv\u00e4rdsj\u00f6]] and western mountain dialects, which are approaching [[H\u00e4lsingem\u00e5l]] and the western Dalecarlian language (over [[Grang\u00e4rde socken|Grang\u00e4rde]] and [[Floda socken, Dalarna|Floda]]). Mountain dialects are also spoken in the northern part of [[V\u00e4stmanland]]. The mountain dialects connect quite closely with neighbouring [[Uppsala dialects]], perhaps most with Eastern V\u00e4stmanland's dialects.\n\nIn everyday speech, many with ''Dalecarlian'' often also refer to regionally coloured \"national languages\" from Dalarna, that is, a lexical and morphologically \"nationally\" Swedish with a Dalarna characteristic [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In [[linguistics]], one distinguishes between regionally coloured [[national language]]s and genuine dialects, and ''Dalecarlian'' is used exclusively for dialects in the latter sense.\n\n== Dalecarlian phonology ==\nAs with most dialects in northern and central Sweden, the Dalecarlian dialects have a supradental heavy-''r'' and a cachuminal (with the tip of the tongue towards the trough) have thick-''l''. However, superdental numbers are more limited than usual, for example, ''rs'' often becomes ''ss'' (for example, Dalecarlian ''koss'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''kors'', [[English language|English]] ''cross''), ''rn'' in southern Dalarna becomes ''r'' (for example, Dalecarlian ''bar'', Swedish ''barn'', English ''child'', Dalecarlian ''bj\u00f6r'', Swedish ''bj\u00f6rn'', English ''bear'', up to and including R\u00e4ttvik, Leksand and V\u00e4sterdalarna). In Dalecarlian proper is often ''nn'', and ''rt'', ''rd'' preserved without assimilation (from Gagnef northwards). ''l'' is not usually cachuminal after ''i'' and ''e'', except in Dalecarlian proper, which in the case of ''l'' has gone its own way and can even partially use cachuminal ''l'' at the beginning of words, for example ''l''\u00e5ta. Dalecarlian has, in the usual way, lost -''n'' and, as a rule, -''t'' in unstressed endings, for example, Dalecarlian ''sola'' or ''sole'', Swedish ''solen'', English ''sun'', Dalecarlian ''g\u00e2tu'', Swedish ''gatan'', English ''street'', Dalecarlian ''biti'', Swedish ''bitit'', English ''bitten''. Like other Upper Swedish dialects, they often have ''i'' in endings for the national languages ''e'', for example Dalecarlian ''funnin'', Swedish ''funnen'', English ''found'', Dalecarlian ''muli'', Swedish ''mulet'', English ''cloudy'', Dalecarlian ''h\u00e4rvil'', Swedish ''h\u00e4rvel'', English ''h\u00e4rvel'' (winding yarn on), has g-sounds, not j, in ''rg'' and ''lg'', for example Dalecarlian and Swedish ''varg'', English ''wolf'', long vowel in front of ''m'' in many words, where the national language has short, for example Dalecarlian ''tima'', Swedish ''timme'', English ''hour'', Dalecarlian ''t\u00f6m'', Swedish ''tom'', English ''empty''. ''j'' has not disappeared without trace after ''k'', ''g'' in words such as Dalecarlian ''\u00e4ntja'', Swedish ''\u00e4nka'', English ''widow'', Dalecarlian ''bryddja'', Swedish ''brygga'', English ''bridge''. As in the northern Swedes and in the northern dialects, ''g'', ''k'' have also been softened to ''tj'', (d) ''j'', for example Dalecarlian ''s\u00e4ttjin'' or ''s\u00e4ttjen'', Swedish ''s\u00e4cken'', English ''bag'', Dalecarlian ''botja'' or ''botje'' Swedish ''boken'', English ''book'', Dalecarlian ''nyttjil'', Swedish ''nyckel'', English ''key''. These traits characterise all Dalecarlian dialects.\n\nCharacteristic of the vocal system in especially Upper Dalarna, with the exception of Dalecarlian proper, is the use of open and end ''a'', which is used in a completely different way than in the national language: the open can occur as far and the closed as short, for example ''hara'' hare with open ''a'' in first, end in second syllable, ''katt'', ''bakka'', ''vagn'' with end, ''skabb'', ''kalv'' with open ''a''; open ''\u00e5'' sound (o) is often replaced by a sound between ''\u00e5'' and ''\u00f6''; The ''u'' sound has a sound similar to the Norwegian ''u''; ''\u00e4'' and ''e'' are well separated; the low-pitched vocals often have a sound of ''\u00e4''. Among the most interesting features of the dialects in \u00c4lvdalen, Mora and Orsa is that they still largely retain the nasal vocal sounds that were previously found in all Nordic dialects. Furthermore, it is noticed that the long ''i'', ''y'', ''u'' diphthongs, usually to ''ai'', ''\u00e5y'', ''au'', for example Dalecarlian ''ais'', Swedish ''is'' English ''ice'', Dalecarlian ''kn\u00e5yta'', Swedish ''knyta'', English ''tie'', Dalecarlian ''aute'', Swedish ''ute'', English ''out''. ''v'' has the [[Old Norse]] pronunciation ''w'' (like ''w'' in English)<ref>Elias Wess\u00e9n, Svensk spr\u00e5khistoria (\u00e5ttonde upplagan), del 1, Lund 1969, sid. 37-38</ref>, ''l'' is usually omitted in front of ''g'', ''k'', ''p'', ''v'', for example, Dalecarlian ''k\u00e5v'', Swedish ''kalf'', English ''calf'', Dalecarlian ''fok'' and such Swedish ''folk'', English ''folk, people''. ''h'' is omitted, for example, Dalecarlian ''and'', Swedish and English ''hand'' (in the \u00c4lvdals-, Orsa- and Mora dialects, as well as in R\u00e4ttvik and parts of Leksand). In the same way, many words have been added as h:n such as ''h\u00e4ven'', ''h\u00e4lsklig'', ''h\u00e4gde''. These features have the common Dalecarlian in common with the older Uppland dialects.\n\nA pair of ancient Nordic diphthongs remain in the western Dalecarlian dialects in Lima and Transtrand. The diphthong ''au'', which in the Swedish state has pronounced ''\u00f6'', has in these areas a slightly changed form, ''\u00f4u'', for example ''d\u00f4u'' (Swedish ''d\u00f6d'', English ''death''). The ancient Swedish diphthongs ''ei'' and ''\u00f6y'' (which in Swedish became ''e'' and ''\u00f6'' respectively) have been pronounced ''\u00e4i'', for example ''sk\u00e4i'' (Swedish ''sked'', English ''Spoon'') and ''here'' (Swedish ''h\u00f6'', English ''hay''), respectively.<ref> Nationalencyklopedin, band 4, sid. 352 </ref>\n\n== Dalecarlian morphology  ==\nIn the '' form theory '' in the valley target in southern Dalarna (mainly in the rock stroke), weak five are noticed. on - '' u '': '' vikku '' week, '' fly '' fly, '' ladu '' e1. '' sound '' barn (on the other hand '' wrap '', if the stem has a '' long '' sound), weak mask. on - '' a '': '' hara '', '' staka '', '' tray ''. Certain shapes are mask. '' boat '' boat, '' tidy '' (south Dalarna to Gagnef) electricity. '' clear '' back, five. '' sunbathing '', '' botja '' (southern Dalarna through parts of Leksand and V\u00e4sterdalarna), '' sole '', '' botje '' (\"valley goal\"), mask. '' haran '' el. '' harn '' the haren, five. '' wick '' week, neutr. '' houses '' house, '' tatji '' (southern Dalarna to Gagnef) or '' tatje '' roof; obese. plur. and strong five. - '' are '', for example '' horses '' horses (less often '' horses ''), '' socks '' parishes, '' priests '' (el. '' priests '') priests, weak five . - '' from '' (most southern Dalarna), for example '' flickering '' girls, neutr. '' tak '' tak, '' ditjen '' dikes (d: o). Best. plur. '' the horse (\u00e4) '', '' the priest (\u00e4) '' (southern Dalarna up against Tuna and Falun) el. '' the horse '' (north of Falun), '' the sock (\u00e4) '' el. '' socknan '', '' flicker (\u00e4) '' (south D.), '' flicker '' el. '' flick con '' (northbound).\n\nIn Upper Dalarna, the declension has developed a peculiar development, in particular through the coincidence of different types of declension. In parts of Gagnef, for example, almost all nouns have the same inflection in plur: \"\" chorus \"\" men, \"\" chick \"\" girls, \"\" baror \"\" children, \"\" apple laurel \"\" apples; Requests. f. '' the guy, the flick, the baran, the apple ''. Instead, at least the \"valley goal\" (including parts of Leksand and Djura) and the western valley goals have preserved the old case-inflection, in particular the dative forms, for example \"\" in bu (d) about \"\" and d. In the sheds. (Also, otherwise, these many age-old features in terms of word-bending - as in the sound system - show, but these are not described here.)\n\nIn the adjective inflection in southern Dalarna, plural is used without endings, for example '' all hands '' all hands, '' many walks '' many times, adj. on - '' in '': '' rolin '' calm, on '' u (g) '': '' toku (g) '' tokig. Me, you, are usually called \"\" mug, dough, say \"\", \"\" springtime, andr\u00e5m \"\" (southern Dalarna) are five. of ours, another. Verbs often lose - '' a '' in infinitive, for example '' running race, tar horses ''. Caste and similar verbs have in the present '' chestnut '' as well as '' encounter '' encounter. The imperfect is usually called '' throw ''. It is called '' where, where '' electricity. '' vuri '' been, '' havi '' el. '' h\u00e4vi '' had, '' been, wurti '' became, became.\n\nIn Upper Dalarna the verb inflection is peculiarly developed, in the actual valley goal it is in some respects very old-fashioned. Regarding the vocabulary, a large number of peculiar and otherwise rare words are noticed, especially in the upper parishes.\n\nIn southern Dalarna it is more normal. The moon is everywhere called '' the moon '' and spring is called '' the box '' (cf. Gotlandian '' the charge ''!), Words that include. a. Used by Dalarna's skull, Erik Axel Karlfeldt. '' Itji '' el. '' tji '' can be used instead of '' not ''. Adverbs on - '' e '' usually end in - '' a '': '' inna, nera, \u00f4ppa '' as in V\u00e4stmanland and G\u00e4strikland. '' Mil '' is neutrum and '' trolley '' feminimum. The name tag is characteristic: the old farm names are used as family names and put before the baptismal name, for example Back P\u00e4r Erssa.\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Adolf Noreen \"Dalm\u00e5let.

{"title_page": "Scientology beliefs and practices", "text_new": "{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Scientology beliefs and practices}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2015}}\nThe [[Church of Scientology]] maintains a wide variety of beliefs and practices. The core belief says that a human is an [[immortality|immortal]], [[Spirit|spiritual being]] ([[thetan]]) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable [[Past lives#Scientology|past lives]], some of which, preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth, were lived in [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial cultures]]. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] will eventually come across and recount a [[Incident (Scientology)|common series of events]].\n\nAccording to the Church, founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s discovery of the thetan places Scientology at the heart of the human quest for meaning, and proves that \"its origins are as ancient as religious thought itself.\" However, Scientology considers that its understanding of the thetan distinguishes it from other religious traditions, especially Judaism and Christianity, in three important ways. First, while many religions fuse the concept of the body and the soul, the thetan (spirit) is separate and independent. Second, unlike the three great world monotheisms, Scientologists believe in past lives and that the thetan has lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes. Third, contrary to Christian concepts of [[original sin]], Scientology holds to the intrinsic goodness of a being and believes that the spiritual essence has lost touch with its nature. \"The spirit, then, is not a thing,\" Hubbard writes. \"It is the creator of things.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history }}</ref>\n\n[[Scientology]] describes itself as the study and handling of the [[spirit]] in relationship to itself, others, and all of life.

The practice is one wherein a counselor called an \"auditor\" addresses a series of questions to a [[preclear]], observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance that the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session.\n\nThe term \"Clear\" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are \"optimal individuals\" and \"they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.\" Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, \"be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills.\"<ref name=\"ZP\">{{harvnb|Zellner|1998|p=}}</ref>\n\n\"Auditing\" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called \"preclear folders\". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress.\n\nAuditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's [[galvanic skin response]] in a manner similar to a [[polygraph]] (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6S9MPQYvPFwC&pg=PT78 |page=78 |title=Religions of the Stars: What Hollywood Believes and How It Affects You |last=Abanes |first=Richard |publisher=Baker Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4412-0445-5}}</ref> The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which \"aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595091823/Scientology-Church-now-claims-more-than-8-million-members.html?pg=all|title=Scientology: Church now claims more than 8 million members|author=Elaine Jarvik|date=September 18, 2004|work=DeseretNews.com}}</ref> Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in.{{Original research inline|date=December 2008}} Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family.

The school, the club, the team, the town, the nation are examples of groups.\n# The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind and as all mankind.\n# The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge to survive as these.\n# The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe and has as its components ''Matter'', ''Energy'', ''Space'' and ''Time'', from which we derive the word MEST.\n# The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit.

The core belief says that a human is an [[immortality|immortal]], [[Spirit|spiritual being]] ([[thetan]]) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable [[Past lives#Scientology|past lives]], some of which, preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth, were lived in [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial cultures]]. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] will eventually come across and recount a [[Incident (Scientology)|common series of events]].\n\nAccording to the Church, founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s discovery of the thetan places Scientology at the heart of the human quest for meaning, and proves that \"its origins are as ancient as religious thought itself.\" However, Scientology considers that its understanding of the thetan distinguishes it from other religious traditions, especially Judaism and Christianity, in three important ways. First, while many religions fuse the concept of the body and the soul, the thetan (spirit) is separate and independent. Second, unlike the three great world monotheisms, Scientologists believe in past lives and that the thetan has lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes. Third, contrary to Christian concepts of [[original sin]], Scientology holds to the intrinsic goodness of a being and believes that the spiritual essence has lost touch with its nature. \"The spirit, then, is not a thing,\" Hubbard writes. \"It is the creator of things.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history }}</ref>\n\n[[Scientology]] describes itself as the study and handling of the [[spirit]] in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability which can be regained if [[Clear (Scientology)|cleared]] of unwanted behaviour patterns and discomforts.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Road To Total Freedom|series=Panorama|publisher=BBC|airdate=April 27, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Farley|first = Robert|title = Scientology nearly ready to unveil Super Power|publisher = St. Petersburg Times|date=May 6, 2006|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/06/Tampabay/Scientology_nearly_re.shtml/|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> Scientology is described as \"a religion to help people use scientific approaches to self-actualize their full potential.\"<ref name=Gutjahr>{{cite journal |jstor=30227336 | title = Reference: The State of the Discipline: Sacred Texts in the United States | journal = Book History | first = Paul C. | last = Gutjahr | volume = 4 | pages = 335\u2013370 | doi=10.1353/bh.2001.0008 | year=2001}}</ref> Believers reach their full potential \"when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being. \"<ref name=Gutjahr/> There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches and most libraries.<ref name=Gutjahr/>\n\nThe Church of Scientology believes that \"Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe,\" as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James R. | title = Scientology | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2009  | location = Cary, NC | isbn = 978-0-19-533149-3}}</ref>\n\nRoy Wallis of Columbia University describes Scientology as \"a movement that straddles the boundaries between psychology and religion, [offering] a graded hierarchy of 'auditing' and training\" with the intention of releasing the individual's full potential.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reference: The Road to Total Freedom, a Sociological Analysis of Scientology | journal = Review of Religious Research | date = Autumn 1978 | first = Kenneth E. | last = Burnham | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 119 | doi=10.2307/3509964| jstor = 3509964 }}</ref>\n\nScientology does not require that their members must exclusively believe in Scientology, distinguishing it from biblical religions.

The practice is one wherein a counselor called an \"auditor\" addresses a series of questions to a [[preclear]], observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance that the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session.\n\nThe term \"Clear\" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are \"optimal individuals\" and \"they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.\" Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, \"be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills.\"<ref name=\"ZP\">{{harvnb|Zellner|1998|p=}}</ref>\n\n\"Auditing\" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called \"preclear folders\". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress.\n\nAuditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's [[galvanic skin response]] in a manner similar to a [[polygraph]] (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6S9MPQYvPFwC&pg=PT78 |page=78 |title=Religions of the Stars: What Hollywood Believes and How It Affects You |last=Abanes |first=Richard |publisher=Baker Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4412-0445-5}}</ref> The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which \"aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595091823/Scientology-Church-now-claims-more-than-8-million-members.html?pg=all|title=Scientology: Church now claims more than 8 million members|author=Elaine Jarvik|date=September 18, 2004|work=DeseretNews.com}}</ref> Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in.{{Original research inline|date=December 2008}} Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family.

A Scientologist must gain ''Knowledge'' of, take ''Responsibility'' for, and effectively exert ''Control'' over elements of his or her environment.\n\nThe ARC triangle is the lower triangle. It is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for.<ref name=\"Neusner\"/> It combines three components: \"Affinity\" is the degree of affection, love or liking, i.e. an emotional state.<ref name=\"Neusner\" /> \"Reality\" reflects [[consensual reality]], that is agreements on what is real.<ref name=\"Neusner\" /> \"Communication\", believed to be the most important element of the triangle, is the exchange of ideas.<ref name=\"Neusner\" /> Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the ARC triangle \"increases the level\" of the other two but the most important aspect of this triangle is \"communication\" mainly because communication drives the other two aspects: \"affinity\" and \"reality\".<ref name=\"GallagherAshcraft2006\">{{cite book|author1=Eugene V.

The second dynamic (a) is the sexual act itself and second dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children.\n# The third dynamic is the urge toward survival through a group of individuals or as a group. Any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be a part of the third dynamic. The school, the club, the team, the town, the nation are examples of groups.\n# The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind and as all mankind.\n# The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge to survive as these.\n# The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe and has as its components ''Matter'', ''Energy'', ''Space'' and ''Time'', from which we derive the word MEST.\n# The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit. Anything spiritual, with or without identity, would come under the seventh dynamic.

Ron Hubbard's book ''The History of Man'', published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body, a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a \"Thetan\" or consciousness \"that has the capacity to separate from body and mind.\" According to Hubbard, \"In man's long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment.\" Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an \"Operating Thetan.\" \"Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul's capacity to leave and operate apart from the body.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Melton | first = J.

The film stars [[Tahar Rahim]] in the title role as an imprisoned petty criminal of Algerian origins who rises in the inmate hierarchy, becoming an [[assassin]] and [[drug trafficker]] as he initiates himself into the Corsican and then Muslim subcultures.\n\n== Plot ==\nMalik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French youth of [[Algeria]]n descent, is sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers. Alone and illiterate upon his arrival, he falls under the sway of [[Corsican mafia|Corsican mobsters]], led by C\u00e9sar Luciani, who enforces a brutal rule.\n\nThe prison is divided between two main factions: the Corsicans and the Muslims. Malik keeps to himself. When Luciani forces him to be the unwilling assassin of Reyeb, a Muslim witness in a trial, Malik gains the protection of the Corsicans despite his Arab origin. \n\nMalik serves as a low-level servant to the Corsicans, who treat him with disdain. All the while, he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb. \n\nWhen most of the Corsicans are transferred or released, Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility. Having secretly learned [[Corsican language|Corsican]], Malik acts as Luciani's eyes and ears in the prison. When Malik earns the privilege of day-long furloughs outside the prison, Luciani relies on him to conduct Luciani's criminal business outside.\n\nRyad, a Muslim friend, teaches Malik to read and write, and the two become close. Ryad teaches Malik about his own heritage, introducing him to two other Muslims, Tarik and Hassan, and increasing his power within the prison. \n\nMalik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer, Jordi. When Ryad gains an early release due to testicular cancer, the three partners organize a drug-running enterprise to sell [[hashish]]. But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif, Malik tracks down Latif's relative inside the prison. He kidnaps the relative's family and forces Latif's gang to release Ryad.\n\nWhen Luciani discovers that Malik is using his day-releases for his own personal enterprise, he punishes him. Malik is sent to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille, another Muslim, who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris, an [[Italian mafia]] group. Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint. When Malik spots a deer warning sign, he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road. He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting wild animals, and they suddenly strike a deer. Lattrache is impressed by Malik, calling him a [[prophet]] and agreeing to conduct criminal business with him instead of Luciani, even though Malik admitted that he killed Reyeb.\n\nLuciani believes there is a \"mole\" in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi, the [[Crime boss|don]] of the [[Unione Corse|Corsican mafia]], for secretly dealing with the Lingherris. But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi: they kill his bodyguards, kidnap him, and inform him that it was Luciani who ordered the hit before abandoning him in the city. \n\nMalik takes refuge at Ryad's house with his wife and young son. Ryad's cancer has returned; his decision to forego more chemotherapy leaves him just six months to live. He gets Malik to promise to take care of his family when he's gone.\n\nUpon Malik's return to the prison, he is placed in solitary for returning late - putting him out of reach of Luciani's retribution - while Marcaggi uses his influence to wipe out much of Luciani's faction. Once back in general population, Malik joins the Muslim faction in the yard. When a now powerless Luciani tries to approach him, two Muslims intercept and beat him.\n\nOn the day of his release, Malik is met by Ryad's wife and son outside the prison. They walk off together, followed by a vehicle convoy carrying Malik's new associates.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tahar Rahim]] as Malik El-Djebena\n* [[Niels Arestrup]] as C\u00e9sar Luciani\n* [[Adel Bencherif]] as Ryad\n* [[Reda Kateb]] as Jordi Le Gitan\n* [[Hichem Yacoubi]] as Reyeb\n* [[Jean-Philippe Ricci]] as Vettori\n* Gilles Cohen as Prof\n* [[Antoine Basler]] as Pilicci\n* [[Le\u00efla Bekhti]] as Djamila, Ryad's wife\n* Pierre Leccia as Sampierro\n* Foued Nassah as Antaro\n* Jean-Emmanuel Pagni as Santi\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Graziani as Chef de d\u00e9tention\n* [[Slimane Dazi]] as Lattrache\n* Alaa Oumouzoune as Rebelled prisoner\n* Salem Kali as Le prisonnier mutin\n* Pascal Henault as Ceccaldi (un corse)\n* Sonia Hell as Une matonne\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAudiard stated that in making the film he intended to \"creat[e] icons, images for people who don't have images in movies, like the Arabs in France,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemotions.com/modules/Interviews/interview/72081 |title=Entretien avec Jacques Audiard, r\u00e9alisateur d'Un proph\u00e8te |website=Cinemotions |language=fr |accessdate=8 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608224440/http://www.cinemotions.com/modules/Interviews/interview/72081 |archivedate=8 June 2010 }}</ref> though he also had stated that the film \"has nothing to do with his vision of society,\" and is a work of fiction.<ref name=huff/>\n\nAudiard had been thinking about making a film set in prison after he had attended a screening of one of his films in one such institution and found himself shocked by the conditions there.

The film stars [[Tahar Rahim]] in the title role as an imprisoned petty criminal of Algerian origins who rises in the inmate hierarchy, becoming an [[assassin]] and [[drug trafficker]] as he initiates himself into the Corsican and then Muslim subcultures.\n\n== Plot ==\nMalik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French youth of [[Algeria]]n descent, is sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers. Alone and illiterate upon his arrival, he falls under the sway of [[Corsican mafia|Corsican mobsters]], led by C\u00e9sar Luciani, who enforces a brutal rule.\n\nThe prison is divided between two main factions: the Corsicans and the Muslims. Malik keeps to himself. When Luciani forces him to be the unwilling assassin of Reyeb, a Muslim witness in a trial, Malik gains the protection of the Corsicans despite his Arab origin. \n\nMalik serves as a low-level servant to the Corsicans, who treat him with disdain. All the while, he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb. \n\nWhen most of the Corsicans are transferred or released, Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility. Having secretly learned [[Corsican language|Corsican]], Malik acts as Luciani's eyes and ears in the prison. When Malik earns the privilege of day-long furloughs outside the prison, Luciani relies on him to conduct Luciani's criminal business outside.\n\nRyad, a Muslim friend, teaches Malik to read and write, and the two become close. Ryad teaches Malik about his own heritage, introducing him to two other Muslims, Tarik and Hassan, and increasing his power within the prison. \n\nMalik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer, Jordi. When Ryad gains an early release due to testicular cancer, the three partners organize a drug-running enterprise to sell [[hashish]]. But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif, Malik tracks down Latif's relative inside the prison. He kidnaps the relative's family and forces Latif's gang to release Ryad.\n\nWhen Luciani discovers that Malik is using his day-releases for his own personal enterprise, he punishes him. Malik is sent to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille, another Muslim, who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris, an [[Italian mafia]] group. Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint. When Malik spots a deer warning sign, he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road. He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting wild animals, and they suddenly strike a deer. Lattrache is impressed by Malik, calling him a [[prophet]] and agreeing to conduct criminal business with him instead of Luciani, even though Malik admitted that he killed Reyeb.\n\nLuciani believes there is a \"mole\" in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi, the [[Crime boss|don]] of the [[Unione Corse|Corsican mafia]], for secretly dealing with the Lingherris. But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi: they kill his bodyguards, kidnap him, and inform him that it was Luciani who ordered the hit before abandoning him in the city. \n\nMalik takes refuge at Ryad's house with his wife and young son. Ryad's cancer has returned; his decision to forego more chemotherapy leaves him just six months to live. He gets Malik to promise to take care of his family when he's gone.\n\nUpon Malik's return to the prison, he is placed in solitary for returning late - putting him out of reach of Luciani's retribution - while Marcaggi uses his influence to wipe out much of Luciani's faction. Once back in general population, Malik joins the Muslim faction in the yard. When a now powerless Luciani tries to approach him, two Muslims intercept and beat him.\n\nOn the day of his release, Malik is met by Ryad's wife and son outside the prison. They walk off together, followed by a vehicle convoy carrying Malik's new associates.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tahar Rahim]] as Malik El-Djebena\n* [[Niels Arestrup]] as C\u00e9sar Luciani\n* [[Adel Bencherif]] as Ryad\n* [[Reda Kateb]] as Jordi Le Gitan\n* [[Hichem Yacoubi]] as Reyeb\n* [[Jean-Philippe Ricci]] as Vettori\n* Gilles Cohen as Prof\n* [[Antoine Basler]] as Pilicci\n* [[Le\u00efla Bekhti]] as Djamila, Ryad's wife\n* Pierre Leccia as Sampierro\n* Foued Nassah as Antaro\n* Jean-Emmanuel Pagni as Santi\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Graziani as Chef de d\u00e9tention\n* [[Slimane Dazi]] as Lattrache\n* Alaa Oumouzoune as Rebelled prisoner\n* Salem Kali as Le prisonnier mutin\n* Pascal Henault as Ceccaldi (un corse)\n* Sonia Hell as Une matonne\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAudiard stated that in making the film he intended to \"creat[e] icons, images for people who don't have images in movies, like the Arabs in France,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemotions.com/modules/Interviews/interview/72081 |title=Entretien avec Jacques Audiard, r\u00e9alisateur d'Un proph\u00e8te |website=Cinemotions |language=fr |accessdate=8 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608224440/http://www.cinemotions.com/modules/Interviews/interview/72081 |archivedate=8 June 2010 }}</ref> though he also had stated that the film \"has nothing to do with his vision of society,\" and is a work of fiction.<ref name=huff/>\n\nAudiard had been thinking about making a film set in prison after he had attended a screening of one of his films in one such institution and found himself shocked by the conditions there.
