This was their initial collaboration with Patrick Riguelle.\n\nIn 1990 their album ''De vogel in de muite'' was released. The sound of this album leaned in the direction of folk rock, but remained primarily a folk record.\n\nThen in 1994, a collaboration with Patrick Riguelle was recorded on the CD ''Nooit met Krijt''.\n\nTwo years later the live album ''De groote boodschap'' was released and this ended the collaboration with Patrick. The departure kicked off a search for a worthy successor who was found in [[Eva de Roovere]]. A first CD was released with her, which was aptly called Eva.\n\nIn 2001, to celebrate their 25th anniversay, they released the two disc compilation album ''All the Best''.<ref>http://www.folkworld.de/21/e/kadril.html</ref>\n\nIn 2003, a second new album is released with Eva, entitled ''Pays''.

In October that year Eva De Roovere left the group, being replaced by [[Mariken Boussemaere]].<ref>https://www.standaard.be/cnt/ggscavgb</ref>\n\nIn 2005 Kadril released ''The Other Shore / De Andere Kust'' with songs relating to emigration to America, a theme that was very close to the Libbrecht brothers. Foreign guests [[Szilvia Bogn\u00e1r]] and [[Heather Grabham]] joined the band's new signer [[Mariken Boussemaere]].\n\nIn 2006, on the occasion of their 30th anniversary, Kadril was the main guest at the [[Nekka-Night]] in the [[Antwerp Sportpaleis]].\n\nOn September 7, 2007 they were together with [[Sois Belle]] in [[Moorslede]] at a benefit concert for [[Sabou Fanyi Guinea]].\n\nIn the spring of 2009 Kadril released the new CD ''Mariage''. Later that year, Mariken Boussemaere left the group; she played her last performance at the Gooikoorts folk festival. [[Karla Verlie]] became the new lead singer of Kadril.\n\nIn 2011 Kadril released the double CD compilation album ''Grand Cru''. In addition to a selection from their previous CDs, this also included unpublished new recordings.\n\nIn 2014 their most recent album ''Archa\u00ef'' was released.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, guitarist Lieven Huys suddenly died of heart failure at the age of fifty.

One such scripture of Hinduism is the Skanda Puran (attributed to Rishi Veda Vyasa), which foretells of an incarnation named Narayan Muni (one of the names given to Swaminarayan by his guru Ramanand Swami) to take place in the age of Kali after the Buddha incarnation and before the incarnation of Kalki. The Skanda Puran's Vaishnav Khand's Vasudev Mahatmyam adhyay 18 shlok 42 onwards details this incarnation. It foretells that this incarnation will advent upon the region of Koshal Desh, due to a curse of a muni (Rishi Dursvasa). It mentions this incarnation will establish dharma and be born to Dharma and Bhakti as a Saamvedi Brahmin bestowed with the name Narayan Muni.<ref>http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/puranas/skanda_purana/skanda_purana_02vaishnava_09vasudeva.pdf</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Akshar-Purushottam Darshan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite book\n |last=Williams \n |first=Raymond \n |year=2001\n |title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism\n |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |isbn=978-0-521-65422-7\n |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will\n |url-access=registration\n |ref=harv\n |postscript=<!--None-->\n }}\n* {{Cite book\n |last=Williams \n |first=Raymond \n |year=2004\n |title=Williams on South Asian Religions and Immigration: Collected Works\n |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.\n |isbn=978-0-7546-3856-8\n |ref=harv\n |postscript=<!--None-->\n }}\n*{{cite book |author = Dermott Killingley |chapter = Hinduism\n |chapter-url= |editor=Ridgeon, Lloyd V.

Inverted cans for street, utility or field marking can be used upside-down with an extension pole.

Areas not to be painted should be masked, although for repair work it is important to avoid spraying a full coat right up to the masking tape, which will leave a hard line; it is better to fade the new paint into the existing paint, especially if the color is difficult to match. The flow of paint should be started or stopped on the masked area rather than over the area intended to be painted, as aerosols often discharge \"blobs\" of paint under these conditions. Coats should be built up lightly enough to avoid runs, but a \"dry\" finish must be avoided by spraying too thinly or from too far away. The optimum distance between the can and workpiece is around one foot (30cm).  Most automotive paints will require a clear lacquer after the color coat, normally 24 hours later.  The color coat should be well matted down with very fine abrasive paper before applying the lacquer.\n\nThere are also a variety of tools to assist in the dispersal of paints including spray paint handles and attachments to equalize the pressure and secure hand grip. Other customized technology such as [[sprayprinter]] can be attached to aerosol cans to partially automate the process of spray painting and allow for images to be created in a manner similar to printing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/spray-printer-street-art/|title=Is the Invention of Spray Printer Going to Change Street Art ?|work=Widewalls|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Graffiti and street art uses===\n{{Main|Graffiti}}\nSpeed, portability, and permanence also make aerosol paint a common [[graffiti]] medium. In the late 1970s, street graffiti writers' signatures and murals became more elaborate and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work. Many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist.\n\nGraffiti artist paints tend to be more expensive, but have a wider selection of rich colors, are thicker and less likely to drip. They are produced in standard high-pressure cans for fast, thick coverage and lower pressure cans for more control and flexibility. Most art brand paints have two or three mixing peas in a can. A wide array of actuators or caps are available, from standard \"skinny\" caps to wider \"fat\" caps, as well as caps that control the softness or crispness of the spray. [[Calligraphy]] caps create fan spray instead of the standard round.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Vlg shop.jpg|The first [[graffiti]] shop in [[Russia]] was opened in 1992 in [[Tver|Tver City]].\nImage:Montana Gold Can.jpg|Street art style can.

[[New York City]], 2007.]]\n{{Main|Stencil|Stencil graffiti}}\nWhen aerosol paint is used, care must be taken to cover or mask areas where the paint is not wanted. A [[stencil]] can be used to protect a surface except for the specific shape that is to be painted. Stencils can be purchased as movable letters, ordered as professionally cut [[logo]]s, or hand-cut by artists.\n\nStencils can be used multiple times for recognition and consistency. Official stencils can be used to quickly and clearly label objects, vehicles or locations. Graffiti writers can use stencils to quickly mark in busy places or leave recognizable tags over a large area. [[List of Stencil Artists|Stencil artists]] often use multiple colors, or create elaborate stencils that are works of art in themselves.\n\n==Illicit use==\n\n===Graffiti===\n<!-- [[Image:Wiki spaint.jpg|thumb|210px|A number of aerosol paint cans left at a graffiti site]] -->\nUnauthorized graffiti is considered to be [[vandalism]] in most jurisdictions mainly because the work or display is done without permission of the property owner. The term 'aerosol art' is commonly used for displaying art form 'with' permission of the property owner.  The UK and many cities in the United States prohibit the sale of aerosol paint to minors as part of graffiti abatement programs.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article814092.ece \"Spray-can sale ban to stop the graffiti kids\"], 19 January 2003</ref> While major industrial and consumer aerosol paint companies like Krylon and Rust-Oleum actively participate in anti-graffiti programs, art-brand companies are often supportive of writers and [[graffiti culture]], though most do not endorse illegal writing.\n\n===Inhalant===\nLike many household [[chemical]]s and [[Aerosol spray|aerosols]], aerosol paint vapor and propellant can be misused as an [[inhalant]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ck0JAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA449|title=Drugs and Society|last=Hanson|first=Glen R.|last2=Hanson|first2=University of Utah Salt Lake City Utah Glen R.|last3=Venturelli|first3=Peter J.|last4=Fleckenstein|first4=Annette E.|date=2014-03-03|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449689872|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Graffiti]]\n* [[Monstercolors]]\n* [[Rust-Oleum]]\n* [[Krylon]]\n* [[Vanishing spray]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205130724/http://www.yorks.karoo.net/aerosol/ The Plain Man's Guide to Aerosols]\n* [http://www.aerosolproducts.org/ CAPCO is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing accurate information about aerosol products]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101114093904/http://www.aboutaerosols.com/ The Aerosol Products Division of the Consumer Specialty Products Association also gives facts and relevant information about aerosol products]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aerosol Paint}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Aerosol sprays]]\n[[Category:Containers]]\n[[Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage]]\n[[Category:Painting materials]]\n\n[[es:Pulverizador]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Aerosol drawing type.svg|thumb|'''[[aerosol spray|Aerosol]] paint''' can.

Other customized technology such as [[sprayprinter]] can be attached to aerosol cans to partially automate the process of spray painting and allow for images to be created in a manner similar to printing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/spray-printer-street-art/|title=Is the Invention of Spray Printer Going to Change Street Art ?|work=Widewalls|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Graffiti and street art uses===\n{{Main|Graffiti}}\nSpeed, portability, and permanence also make aerosol paint a common [[graffiti]] medium. In the late 1970s, street graffiti writers' signatures and murals became more elaborate and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work. Many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist.\n\nGraffiti artist paints tend to be more expensive, but have a wider selection of rich colors, are thicker and less likely to drip. They are produced in standard high-pressure cans for fast, thick coverage and lower pressure cans for more control and flexibility. Most art brand paints have two or three mixing peas in a can. A wide array of actuators or caps are available, from standard \"skinny\" caps to wider \"fat\" caps, as well as caps that control the softness or crispness of the spray. [[Calligraphy]] caps create fan spray instead of the standard round.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Vlg shop.jpg|The first [[graffiti]] shop in [[Russia]] was opened in 1992 in [[Tver|Tver City]].\nImage:Montana Gold Can.jpg|Street art style can.

[[New York City]], 2007.]]\n{{Main|Stencil|Stencil graffiti}}\nWhen aerosol paint is used, care must be taken to cover or mask areas where the paint is not wanted. A [[stencil]] can be used to protect a surface except for the specific shape that is to be painted. Stencils can be purchased as movable letters, ordered as professionally cut [[logo]]s, or hand-cut by artists.\n\nStencils can be used multiple times for recognition and consistency. Official stencils can be used to quickly and clearly label objects, vehicles or locations. Graffiti writers can use stencils to quickly mark in busy places or leave recognizable tags over a large area. [[List of Stencil Artists|Stencil artists]] often use multiple colors, or create elaborate stencils that are works of art in themselves.\n\n==Illicit use==\n\n===Graffiti===\n<!-- [[Image:Wiki spaint.jpg|thumb|210px|A number of aerosol paint cans left at a graffiti site]] -->\nUnauthorized graffiti is considered to be [[vandalism]] in most jurisdictions mainly because the work or display is done without permission of the property owner. The term 'aerosol art' is commonly used for displaying art form 'with' permission of the property owner.  The UK and many cities in the United States prohibit the sale of aerosol paint to minors as part of graffiti abatement programs.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article814092.ece \"Spray-can sale ban to stop the graffiti kids\"], 19 January 2003</ref> While major industrial and consumer aerosol paint companies like Krylon and Rust-Oleum actively participate in anti-graffiti programs, art-brand companies are often supportive of writers and [[graffiti culture]], though most do not endorse illegal writing.\n\n===Inhalant===\nLike many household [[chemical]]s and [[Aerosol spray|aerosols]], aerosol paint vapor and propellant can be misused as an [[inhalant]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ck0JAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA449&dq=Like+many+household+chemicals+and+aerosols,+aerosol+paint+vapor+and+propellant+can+be+misused+as+an+inhalant.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizz5_V3IPYAhUr7IMKHVM7CbUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Like%20many%20household%20chemicals%20and%20aerosols,%20aerosol%20paint%20vapor%20and%20propellant%20can%20be%20misused%20as%20an%20inhalant.&f=false|title=Drugs and Society|last=Hanson|first=Glen R.|last2=Hanson|first2=University of Utah Salt Lake City Utah Glen R.|last3=Venturelli|first3=Peter J.|last4=Fleckenstein|first4=Annette E.|date=2014-03-03|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449689872|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Graffiti]]\n* [[Monstercolors]]\n* [[Rust-Oleum]]\n* [[Krylon]]\n* [[Vanishing spray]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205130724/http://www.yorks.karoo.net/aerosol/ The Plain Man's Guide to Aerosols]\n* [http://www.aerosolproducts.org/ CAPCO is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing accurate information about aerosol products]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101114093904/http://www.aboutaerosols.com/ The Aerosol Products Division of the Consumer Specialty Products Association also gives facts and relevant information about aerosol products]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aerosol Paint}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Aerosol sprays]]\n[[Category:Containers]]\n[[Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage]]\n[[Category:Painting materials]]\n\n[[es:Pulverizador]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "Script-assisted fixes: perCS1andMOS:ITALICS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol_paint"}
