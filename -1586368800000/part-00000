The club was founded in 1909. Its colours are black and white.\n\nIn its history, Sturm Graz has won the Austrian football championship three times, in 1998, 1999 and 2011, and participated several times in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]]. Their biggest rivals are Graz neighbours [[Grazer AK]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Sturm Graz Performance Graph.png|300px|thumb|Historical chart of Sturm Graz league performance]]\n\n=== Foundation ===\nSK Sturm Graz was founded in 1909 as a workers team, as opposed to its neighbours [[Grazer AK]], founded in 1902. Between 1921 and 1949, the team enjoyed considerable success in winning the regional Styrian championship 11 times.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe [[Anschluss]] in 1938 made Austria part of the [[Nazi Germany|German Third Reich]] and Austrian clubs became part of German football competition. Sturm played in the opening round of the 1940 Tschammerpokal, predecessor to the modern-day [[DFB-Pokal]]. They then qualified to play in the [[Gauliga Ostmark]], one of Germany's top-flight regional leagues, in 1941. The team withdrew part way through the 1941\u201342 season and was relegated after an 11th-place result in the following campaign.<ref>Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop\u00e4die des deutschen Ligafu\u00dfballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. {{ISBN|9783897841475}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Sturm entered the Austrian national league as the first non-[[Vienna]]-based team.\n\n=== 1981: First success ===\nThe first great success came under manager [[Otto Bari\u0107]], when the club finished runners-up in the league in the 1980\u201381 season. In 1983\u201384, the club battled through to the quarter-finals of the [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], beaten only by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] through a penalty in extra-time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Liverpool's barrage gets semi-final spot|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=diwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lqUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2011%2C946439|date=22 March 1984|accessdate=4 September 2013|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|agency=United Press International}}</ref>\n\n=== 1992: Start of a new era ===\nIn December 1992, [[Hannes Kartnig]] was installed as president, naming his close friend [[Heinz Schilcher]] as new manager. At the time, Sturm was languishing under enormous debts. Sturm qualified for the newly formed [[Zehnerliga]], and Kartnig and Schilcher decided the best course of action would be to abstain from big-name signings, opting instead for a new start using young players from the club's youth setup. In 1993, [[Milan \u0110uri\u010di\u0107 (footballer, born 1945)|Milan \u0110uri\u010di\u0107]] became manager.\n\n=== 1994 to 2002: Osim and European football ===\nIn 1994, the Bosnian [[Ivica Osim]] took control of the up-to-now unsuccessful Sturm; this proved to be a crucial turning-point in the club's history. Osim succeeded in producing an effective and powerful team using the young and inexperienced players at his disposal, strengthened with a few experienced leading players. The team's first success was as runners-up in the league in 1995. One year later, they won their first title, beating [[FC Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling|Admira Wacker]] in the cup final, but wobbling in the league to finish runners-up yet again.\n\nIn 1998, Sturm won its first Austrian Bundesliga title, pulling away from the field early on and winning the title with seven games in hand. Sturm set two records during this season; they remained unbeaten in their first 12 matches, and then for another 19 matches later in the season. At the end of the season, they amassed 81 points, an Austrian record total, winning the title with 19 points ahead of [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]. This season also saw the development of the \"magic triangle\" of [[Mario Haas]], [[Hannes Reinmayr]] and [[Ivica Vasti\u0107]].\n\nThe year 1999 saw Sturm Graz retain the title, securing the treble as they did so (league, cup and super cup), in addition to appearing in the qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League]]. Here, however, a scoreless draw with [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] proved to be the team's only success. The 1999\u20132000 season saw Sturm in the Champions League for a second time, finishing third in its group. [[FC Tirol]] wrested the domestic title from Sturm's grasp, but the runners-up spot achieved was sufficient for a third trip into the following season's Champions League.\n\nSensationally, Sturm Graz won its Champions League Group D (against [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]]), reaching the second round for the first time. The league campaign was less successful&nbsp;\u2013 a fourth-place finish, the worst under Osim.\n\nAfter the Champions League exploits, several key players out of the 12 who later left were not suitably replaced. Worse still, this hasty squad redevelopment devoured almost all the profit made from the European campaign. Only a small fraction of the money was invested in youth development to establish an academy.  Despite this, the newly assembled team again finished in second place in the league, but failed at the qualification hurdle for the Champions League. This, together with increasing criticism from the club president, precipitated the departure of Osim after eight years at the helm.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== 2002 to 2009: Consolidation ===\n[[File:Mannschaft des SK Sturm Graz beim Cupfinale 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sturm Graz, 2010 cup winners]]\n[[Franco Foda]] and [[Gilbert Gress]] (seven defeats in nine games) both enjoyed short and fruitless stints as coach, before former sweeper [[Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 (footballer)|Michael Petrovi\u0107]] took control in autumn 2003. He presided over a gradual introduction of young talent, securing the team's place in the top flight in both 2004 and 2005, finishing in seventh position.\n\nSince 2005, Sturm has been facing financial problems and, on 1 September 2006, a petition of bankruptcy was filed by the tax authorities. Because of the financial situation, Sturm was forced to use young players who were soon sold to reconsole the club. Also in 2006, coach Michael Petrovi\u0107 left the club and was replaced by Franco Foda.\n\n=== 2009 to present day: New successes ===\n[[File:Sturm Graz.png|thumb|right|Former logo]]\nAfter a fourth-place finish in 2009, the Blackies qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Europe League]] in 2009\u201310. Their opponents were Galatasaray, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]]. In 2010, the Blackies won the [[\u00d6FB-Cup]] in [[Klagenfurt]] in front of 25,000 of its own fans against [[SC Wiener Neustadt|Wiener Neustadt]]. That was the highest number of fans ever travelling to a match in a different [[States of Austria|state]].\n\nIn 2010\u201311, Sturm won the Austrian championship. A highlight of the season was a qualifying match against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]].\n\nIn 2011\u201312, Sturm played in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] qualification rounds and managed to defeat Hungarian club [[Videoton FC|Videoton]] and [[FC Zestafoni|Zestafoni]] of Georgia. In the play-off, however, Sturm Graz lost against [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]], thus ensuring qualification to the group stages of the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|Europe League]], where they were grouped with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. At the end of the season, Sturm finished fifth in the Bundesliga and head coach Franco Foda was fired after six years. With his replacement [[Peter Hyballa]], Sturm played strong during the autumn months, but a poor spring resulted in Hyballa's dismissal before the end of the season. Luckily, Sturm managed to fourth in the final league table, albeit with the lowest number of points ever sufficed for fourth place. This ensured Europa League qualification for the subsequent year. [[Darko Milani\u010d]], who won several titles with [[NK Maribor|Maribor]] in Slovenia, took the reins of the club for the 2013\u201314 campaign.\n\n== Stadium ==\n[[File:Merkur Arena.jpg|thumb|200px|[[UPC-Arena]]]]\n\nThe traditional home of the team for many years was the ''[[Gruabn]]'', which held over 12,000 people&nbsp;\u2013 almost exclusively standing&nbsp;\u2013 and which was characterised by its narrow playing field and the proximity of the fans to the players. From 1997 to 2005, Gruabn was used just as a training ground and for youth and amateur matches. In 2005, the ground was sold to the city of Graz to relieve the club's financial difficulties. The year 1997 saw the club's move to the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium]], shared between Sturm and its local rivals, [[Grazer AK]]. From February 2006, the stadium was called [[UPC-Arena]]. In July 2016, Merkur Insurance won the Sponsoring rights for the stadium. The stadium is now called the Merkur Arena.\n\n== Fans and the Graz Derby ==\nA study published in 2008 by the German market research institute ''Sport + Markt'' showed that Sturm have around 360,000 fans across Austria, which is only second to the number of [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]] supporters.<ref>http://www.oe24.at/sport/fussball/rapid_wien/700000_Oesterreicher_sind_Rapid-Fans_361960.ece</ref> In Europe, there are estimated to be 410,000 fans, which ranks them as the 117th-most supported club.<ref>[http://www.kleinezeitung.at/sport/fussball/1776577/index.do Bericht zur Studie auf ''kleinezeitung.at''], abgerufen am 25. M\u00e4rz 2009.</ref>\n\nThere are several organised [[Ultras|fan groups]]&nbsp;\u2013 the biggest and most well-known are Jewels Sturm and the Brigata Graz, which were both founded in 1994, and Grazer Sturmflut, founded two years later in 1996.\n\nSturm fans have a very strong friendship with fans of German [[2. Bundesliga]] club [[Karlsruher SC|Karlsruhe]]. They have also contacts with fans of [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] and fans from [[Pisa Calcio|Pisa]] and [[Carrarese Calcio|Carrara]] in the Italian league. More recently, they have also had contacts with a group of [[NK Maribor|Maribor]] ultras.\n\nSturm have a big rivalry with cross-town rivals [[Grazer AK]], with whom they compete the Graz Derby. In 1974, there was big opposition from both sets of fans against a proposed merger to become \"FC Graz.\" Since 1920, excluding the friendly matches (especially before the first official Styrian Cup in 1920), 197 matches have been played between the two, of which there were 185 encounters in the [[Football in Austria|league]] (130 at the professional level and 55 at amateur level in the Styrian League); an additional five encounters in the [[Austrian Cup]]; one match in the [[Austrian Supercup]]; two meetings in the [[Tschammerpokal]] and four games in the Styrian Cup. The very first Derby took place in 1911, the last was dated 17 May 2007. So far, Sturm have won more derby matches than Grazer AK.\n\nOther rivalries are with the two Vienna clubs ([[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] and [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]) due to the history of competition for trophies between the three clubs, and as with most [[ultras]] the fans have a strong dislike of [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]], unhappy with the acquisition of [[SV Austria Salzburg|Austria Salzburg]] by Austrian [[energy drink]] company [[Red Bull]].\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''[[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]]'''\n:* '''Champions (3)''': [[1997\u201398 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1997\u201398]], [[1998\u201399 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1998\u201399]], [[2010\u201311 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2010\u201311]]\n:* Runners-up (6): [[1980\u201381 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1980\u201381]], [[1994\u201395 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1994\u201395]], [[1995\u201396 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1995\u201396]], [[1999\u20132000 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1999\u20132000]], [[2001\u201302 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2001\u201302]], [[2017\u201318 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2017\u201318]]\n\n* '''[[Austrian Cup|\u00d6FB-Cup]]'''\n:* '''Winners (5)''': 1995\u201396, 1996\u201397, [[1998\u201399 Austrian Cup|1998\u201399]], [[2009\u201310 Austrian Cup|2009\u201310]], [[2017\u201318 Austrian Cup|2017\u201318]]\n:* Runners-up (4): 1947\u201348, 1974\u201375, 1997\u201398, [[2001\u201302 Austrian Cup|2001\u201302]]\n\n* '''[[Austrian Supercup]]'''\n:* '''Winners (3)''': 1996, 1998, 1999\n:* Runners-up (2): 1997, 2002\n\n* '''Austrian Amateur Champions''' (1): 1934\n\n*'''[[UEFA Champions League]]''' (3 participations): [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League|1998\u201399]], [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League|2000\u201301 (2nd Group stage)]]\n\n*'''[[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]''' (11 participations): [[1970\u201371 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1970\u201371]], [[1974\u201375 UEFA Cup|1974\u201375]], [[1978\u201379 UEFA Cup|1978\u201379]], [[1981\u201382 UEFA Cup|1981\u201382]], [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup|1983\u201384]] (Quarter-final), [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup|1988\u201389]], [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1991\u201392]], [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup|1995\u201396]], [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|1999\u20132000]], [[2002\u201303 UEFA Cup|2002\u201303]]\n\n*'''[[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]''' (1): [[2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup|2008]] (Joint Winner)<ref name=\"Intertoto2008\">[http://www.eurotopfoot.com/uic.php3 Coupe Intertoto 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205222/http://www.eurotopfoot.com/uic.php3 |date=6 June 2014 }}.

The club was founded in 1909. Its colours are black and white.\n\nIn its history, Sturm Graz has won the Austrian football championship three times, in 1998, 1999 and 2011, and participated several times in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]]. Their biggest rivals are Graz neighbours [[Grazer AK]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Sturm Graz Performance Graph.png|300px|thumb|Historical chart of Sturm Graz league performance]]\n\n=== Foundation ===\nSK Sturm Graz was founded in 1909 as a workers team, as opposed to its neighbours [[Grazer AK]], founded in 1902. Between 1921 and 1949, the team enjoyed considerable success in winning the regional Styrian championship 11 times.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe [[Anschluss]] in 1938 made Austria part of the [[Nazi Germany|German Third Reich]] and Austrian clubs became part of German football competition. Sturm played in the opening round of the 1940 Tschammerpokal, predecessor to the modern-day [[DFB-Pokal]]. They then qualified to play in the [[Gauliga Ostmark]], one of Germany's top-flight regional leagues, in 1941. The team withdrew part way through the 1941\u201342 season and was relegated after an 11th-place result in the following campaign.<ref>Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop\u00e4die des deutschen Ligafu\u00dfballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. {{ISBN|9783897841475}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Sturm entered the Austrian national league as the first non-[[Vienna]]-based team.\n\n=== 1981: First success ===\nThe first great success came under manager [[Otto Bari\u0107]], when the club finished runners-up in the league in the 1980\u201381 season. In 1983\u201384, the club battled through to the quarter-finals of the [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], beaten only by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] through a penalty in extra-time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Liverpool's barrage gets semi-final spot|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=diwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lqUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2011%2C946439|date=22 March 1984|accessdate=4 September 2013|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|agency=United Press International}}</ref>\n\n=== 1992: Start of a new era ===\nIn December 1992, [[Hannes Kartnig]] was installed as president, naming his close friend [[Heinz Schilcher]] as new manager. At the time, Sturm was languishing under enormous debts. Sturm qualified for the newly formed [[Zehnerliga]], and Kartnig and Schilcher decided the best course of action would be to abstain from big-name signings, opting instead for a new start using young players from the club's youth setup. In 1993, [[Milan \u0110uri\u010di\u0107 (footballer, born 1945)|Milan \u0110uri\u010di\u0107]] became manager.\n\n=== 1994 to 2002: Osim and European football ===\nIn 1994, the Bosnian [[Ivica Osim]] took control of the up-to-now unsuccessful Sturm; this proved to be a crucial turning-point in the club's history. Osim succeeded in producing an effective and powerful team using the young and inexperienced players at his disposal, strengthened with a few experienced leading players. The team's first success was as runners-up in the league in 1995. One year later, they won their first title, beating [[FC Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling|Admira Wacker]] in the cup final, but wobbling in the league to finish runners-up yet again.\n\nIn 1998, Sturm won its first Austrian Bundesliga title, pulling away from the field early on and winning the title with seven games in hand. Sturm set two records during this season; they remained unbeaten in their first 12 matches, and then for another 19 matches later in the season. At the end of the season, they amassed 81 points, an Austrian record total, winning the title with 19 points ahead of [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]. This season also saw the development of the \"magic triangle\" of [[Mario Haas]], [[Hannes Reinmayr]] and [[Ivica Vasti\u0107]].\n\nThe year 1999 saw Sturm Graz retain the title, securing the treble as they did so (league, cup and super cup), in addition to appearing in the qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League]]. Here, however, a scoreless draw with [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] proved to be the team's only success. The 1999\u20132000 season saw Sturm in the Champions League for a second time, finishing third in its group. [[FC Tirol]] wrested the domestic title from Sturm's grasp, but the runners-up spot achieved was sufficient for a third trip into the following season's Champions League.\n\nSensationally, Sturm Graz won its Champions League Group D (against [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]]), reaching the second round for the first time. The league campaign was less successful&nbsp;\u2013 a fourth-place finish, the worst under Osim.\n\nAfter the Champions League exploits, several key players out of the 12 who later left were not suitably replaced. Worse still, this hasty squad redevelopment devoured almost all the profit made from the European campaign. Only a small fraction of the money was invested in youth development to establish an academy.  Despite this, the newly assembled team again finished in second place in the league, but failed at the qualification hurdle for the Champions League. This, together with increasing criticism from the club president, precipitated the departure of Osim after eight years at the helm.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== 2002 to 2009: Consolidation ===\n[[File:Mannschaft des SK Sturm Graz beim Cupfinale 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sturm Graz, 2010 cup winners]]\n[[Franco Foda]] and [[Gilbert Gress]] (seven defeats in nine games) both enjoyed short and fruitless stints as coach, before former sweeper [[Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 (footballer)|Michael Petrovi\u0107]] took control in autumn 2003. He presided over a gradual introduction of young talent, securing the team's place in the top flight in both 2004 and 2005, finishing in seventh position.\n\nSince 2005, Sturm has been facing financial problems and, on 1 September 2006, a petition of bankruptcy was filed by the tax authorities. Because of the financial situation, Sturm was forced to use young players who were soon sold to reconsole the club. Also in 2006, coach Michael Petrovi\u0107 left the club and was replaced by Franco Foda.\n\n=== 2009 to present day: New successes ===\n[[File:Sturm Graz.png|thumb|right|Former logo]]\nAfter a fourth-place finish in 2009, the Blackies qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Europe League]] in 2009\u201310. Their opponents were Galatasaray, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]]. In 2010, the Blackies won the [[\u00d6FB-Cup]] in [[Klagenfurt]] in front of 25,000 of its own fans against [[SC Wiener Neustadt|Wiener Neustadt]]. That was the highest number of fans ever travelling to a match in a different [[States of Austria|state]].\n\nIn 2010\u201311, Sturm won the Austrian championship. A highlight of the season was a qualifying match against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]].\n\nIn 2011\u201312, Sturm played in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] qualification rounds and managed to defeat Hungarian club [[Videoton FC|Videoton]] and [[FC Zestafoni|Zestafoni]] of Georgia. In the play-off, however, Sturm Graz lost against [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]], thus ensuring qualification to the group stages of the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|Europe League]], where they were grouped with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. At the end of the season, Sturm finished fifth in the Bundesliga and head coach Franco Foda was fired after six years. With his replacement [[Peter Hyballa]], Sturm played strong during the autumn months, but a poor spring resulted in Hyballa's dismissal before the end of the season. Luckily, Sturm managed to fourth in the final league table, albeit with the lowest number of points ever sufficed for fourth place. This ensured Europa League qualification for the subsequent year. [[Darko Milani\u010d]], who won several titles with [[NK Maribor|Maribor]] in Slovenia, took the reins of the club for the 2013\u201314 campaign.\n\n== Stadium ==\n[[File:Merkur Arena.jpg|thumb|200px|[[UPC-Arena]]]]\n\nThe traditional home of the team for many years was the ''[[Gruabn]]'', which held over 12,000 people&nbsp;\u2013 almost exclusively standing&nbsp;\u2013 and which was characterised by its narrow playing field and the proximity of the fans to the players. From 1997 to 2005, Gruabn was used just as a training ground and for youth and amateur matches. In 2005, the ground was sold to the city of Graz to relieve the club's financial difficulties. The year 1997 saw the club's move to the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium]], shared between Sturm and its local rivals, [[Grazer AK]]. From February 2006, the stadium was called [[UPC-Arena]]. In July 2016, Merkur Insurance won the Sponsoring rights for the stadium. The stadium is now called the Merkur Arena.\n\n== Fans and the Graz Derby ==\nA study published in 2008 by the German market research institute ''Sport + Markt'' showed that Sturm have around 360,000 fans across Austria, which is only second to the number of [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]] supporters.<ref>http://www.oe24.at/sport/fussball/rapid_wien/700000_Oesterreicher_sind_Rapid-Fans_361960.ece</ref> In Europe, there are estimated to be 410,000 fans, which ranks them as the 117th-most supported club.<ref>[http://www.kleinezeitung.at/sport/fussball/1776577/index.do Bericht zur Studie auf ''kleinezeitung.at''], abgerufen am 25. M\u00e4rz 2009.</ref>\n\nThere are several organised [[Ultras|fan groups]]&nbsp;\u2013 the biggest and most well-known are Jewels Sturm and the Brigata Graz, which were both founded in 1994, and Grazer Sturmflut, founded two years later in 1996.\n\nSturm fans have a very strong friendship with fans of German [[2. Bundesliga]] club [[Karlsruher SC|Karlsruhe]]. They have also contacts with fans of [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] and fans from [[Pisa Calcio|Pisa]] and [[Carrarese Calcio|Carrara]] in the Italian league. More recently, they have also had contacts with a group of [[NK Maribor|Maribor]] ultras.\n\nSturm have a big rivalry with cross-town rivals [[Grazer AK]], with whom they compete the Graz Derby. In 1974, there was big opposition from both sets of fans against a proposed merger to become \"FC Graz.\" Since 1920, excluding the friendly matches (especially before the first official Styrian Cup in 1920), 197 matches have been played between the two, of which there were 185 encounters in the [[Football in Austria|league]] (130 at the professional level and 55 at amateur level in the Styrian League); an additional five encounters in the [[Austrian Cup]]; one match in the [[Austrian Supercup]]; two meetings in the [[Tschammerpokal]] and four games in the Styrian Cup. The very first Derby took place in 1911, the last was dated 17 May 2007. So far, Sturm have won more derby matches than Grazer AK.\n\nOther rivalries are with the two Vienna clubs ([[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] and [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]) due to the history of competition for trophies between the three clubs, and as with most [[ultras]] the fans have a strong dislike of [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]], unhappy with the acquisition of [[SV Austria Salzburg|Austria Salzburg]] by Austrian [[energy drink]] company [[Red Bull]].\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''[[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]]'''\n:* '''Champions (3)''': [[1997\u201398 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1997\u201398]], [[1998\u201399 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1998\u201399]], [[2010\u201311 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2010\u201311]]\n:* Runners-up (6): [[1980\u201381 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1980\u201381]], [[1994\u201395 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1994\u201395]], [[1995\u201396 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1995\u201396]], [[1999\u20132000 Austrian Football Bundesliga|1999\u20132000]], [[2001\u201302 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2001\u201302]], [[2017\u201318 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2017\u201318]]\n\n* '''[[Austrian Cup|\u00d6FB-Cup]]'''\n:* '''Winners (5)''': 1995\u201396, 1996\u201397, [[1998\u201399 Austrian Cup|1998\u201399]], [[2009\u201310 Austrian Cup|2009\u201310]], [[2017\u201318 Austrian Cup|2017\u201318]]\n:* Runners-up (4): 1947\u201348, 1974\u201375, 1997\u201398, [[2001\u201302 Austrian Cup|2001\u201302]]\n\n* '''[[Austrian Supercup]]'''\n:* '''Winners (3)''': 1996, 1998, 1999\n:* Runners-up (2): 1997, 2002\n\n* '''Austrian Amateur Champions''' (1): 1934\n\n*'''[[UEFA Champions League]]''' (3 participations): [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League|1998\u201399]], [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Champions League|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League|2000\u201301 (2nd Group stage)]]\n\n*'''[[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]''' (11 participations): [[1970\u201371 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1970\u201371]], [[1974\u201375 UEFA Cup|1974\u201375]], [[1978\u201379 UEFA Cup|1978\u201379]], [[1981\u201382 UEFA Cup|1981\u201382]], [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup|1983\u201384]] (Quarter-final), [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup|1988\u201389]], [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1991\u201392]], [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup|1995\u201396]], [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|1999\u20132000]], [[2002\u201303 UEFA Cup|2002\u201303]]\n\n*'''[[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]''' (1): [[2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup|2008]] (Joint Winner)<ref name=\"Intertoto2008\">[http://www.eurotopfoot.com/uic.php3 Coupe Intertoto 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205222/http://www.eurotopfoot.com/uic.php3 |date=6 June 2014 }}.

After all of them performed, the acts were brought in front of the judges as part of one of three groups. Two of these groups made it through and one was eliminated, leaving 100 acts still in the competition. The judges threw a party for the remaining acts that for many lasted late into the night.\n\nDay two started with everyone getting woken up at 6:00am and heading to meet Reid. He informed them that they would be put into \"ensembles\" and groups, and would be working with stylists, choreographers, and vocal coaches. They were given five hours to learn the songs they were given. One third of the acts would be eliminated by the end of the second day. Several of the ensembles performances were aired. The first ensemble performed \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", the second ensemble performed \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", the third ensemble performed \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]\", the fourth ensemble performed \"[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]\", the fifth ensemble performed \"[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]\", the sixth ensemble performed \"[[Feeling Good]]\", the seventh ensemble performed \"[[I Have Nothing]]\" and the eighth ensemble performed \"[[Run (Leona Lewis song)|Run]]\".\n\nDay two continued with more ensembles performing for the judges. The ninth ensemble performed \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". Next, they showed a couple of quick shots of some ensembles, presumably consisting of all people that would not make it through to the end. The tenth ensemble that was covered in detail performed \"[[I Won't Let Go (Rascal Flatts song)|I Won't Let Go]]\". The eleventh (and final) ensemble performed \"[[Chasing Cars]]\". Next, the judges deliberated, and decided on which a third of the acts would be eliminated. Once again, three groups were brought in. Group 1 was eliminated, meaning groups 2 and 3 made it through to the next round of boot camp.\n\nDay three had all 64 acts perform for the judges. They were given a list of 35 songs at the end of the day two and were told to choose one that best represented them. At the end of this final boot camp round, 32 acts would go through to judges' houses. This final performance was done in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. After each of the performances, the judges gave no feedback.\n\nThe first boot camp episode aired on October 5, 2011 and covered the first two days of boot camp.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/> The second bootcamp episode aired on October 6 and covered the rest of day two and the remainder of bootcamp. By the end of bootcamp, 162 acts were cut to 32, 8 acts in each category. The judges later found out which category they would mentor and their acts joined them at their house.\n\n===Judges' houses===\n[[Enrique Iglesias]] helped Scherzinger to pick her finalists in [[Malibu, California]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] acted as a guest judge helping Abdul to pick her finalists in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. [[Rihanna]] helped Reid choose his finalists in [[The Hamptons|The Hamptons, New York]].

Her vote either meant that if she would eliminate Canty, Canty would be eliminated or if she voted against Crow, the result would go to deadlock and the public vote would determine the result. While Scherzinger was deliberating, she wanted the public vote to decide the outcome that week and sent the result to deadlock. Following this, Crow was voted out which led to Crow breaking down on stage and Scherzinger was booed off the stage and her future on the show was put in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dean Piper |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/12/11/nicole-scherzinger-faces-the-axe-after-us-x-factor-backlash-115875-23626040/ |title=Nicole Scherzinger faces the axe after US X Factor backlash \u2013 3am & Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> She subsequently received death threats from some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Geno |url=http://www.genogenogeno.com/2011/12/nicole-scherzinger-on-receiving-death.html |title=Geno's World: Nicole Scherzinger On Receiving Death Threats Over Rachel Crow's 'X Factor' Elimination |publisher=Genogenogeno.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Scherzinger was let go at the end of the season and later relocated to [[London]] to be a judge on the [[The X Factor (British series 9)|2012 series of the UK show]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thexfactorusa.com Official website]\n\n{{The X Factor U.S.}}\n{{The X Factor (U.S.) contestants}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (American season 1)}}\n[[Category:The X Factor (American TV series)|Season 1]]\n[[Category:2011 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United States 01]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox reality music competition\n|series        = The X Factor (U.S.){{!}}The X Factor\n|season        = 1\n|first_aired   = {{start date|2011|9|21}}\n|last_aired    = {{start date|2011|12|22}}\n|image         = [[File:Melanie Amaro 2013.jpg|200px]]\n|judges        = [[Paula Abdul]]<br/>[[Simon Cowell]]<br>[[L.A.

After all of them performed, the acts were brought in front of the judges as part of one of three groups. Two of these groups made it through and one was eliminated, leaving 100 acts still in the competition. The judges threw a party for the remaining acts that for many lasted late into the night.\n\nDay two started with everyone getting woken up at 6:00am and heading to meet Reid. He informed them that they would be put into \"ensembles\" and groups, and would be working with stylists, choreographers, and vocal coaches. They were given five hours to learn the songs they were given. One third of the acts would be eliminated by the end of the second day. Several of the ensembles performances were aired. The first ensemble performed \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", the second ensemble performed \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", the third ensemble performed \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]\", the fourth ensemble performed \"[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]\", the fifth ensemble performed \"[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]\", the sixth ensemble performed \"[[Feeling Good]]\", the seventh ensemble performed \"[[I Have Nothing]]\" and the eighth ensemble performed \"[[Run (Leona Lewis song)|Run]]\".\n\nDay two continued with more ensembles performing for the judges. The ninth ensemble performed \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". Next, they showed a couple of quick shots of some ensembles, presumably consisting of all people that would not make it through to the end. The tenth ensemble that was covered in detail performed \"[[I Won't Let Go (Rascal Flatts song)|I Won't Let Go]]\". The eleventh (and final) ensemble performed \"[[Chasing Cars]]\". Next, the judges deliberated, and decided on which a third of the acts would be eliminated. Once again, three groups were brought in. Group 1 was eliminated, meaning groups 2 and 3 made it through to the next round of boot camp.\n\nDay three had all 64 acts perform for the judges. They were given a list of 35 songs at the end of the day two and were told to choose one that best represented them. At the end of this final boot camp round, 32 acts would go through to judges' houses. This final performance was done in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. After each of the performances, the judges gave no feedback.\n\nThe first boot camp episode aired on October 5, 2011 and covered the first two days of boot camp.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/> The second bootcamp episode aired on October 6 and covered the rest of day two and the remainder of bootcamp. By the end of bootcamp, 162 acts were cut to 32, 8 acts in each category.

The judges' houses 2 episode was originally scheduled for October 13 and so was also moved to October 16. The time-delay version shown in the UK was also delayed to avoid the results being shown outside of the U.S. first.</ref>}}\n\n===Controversy===\nIn the quarter-final result show, Scherzinger who had the deciding vote, was clearly upset with the bottom two acts ([[Rachel Crow]] and [[Marcus Canty]]) because she admired both acts and was undecided about how she would vote. Her vote either meant that if she would eliminate Canty, Canty would be eliminated or if she voted against Crow, the result would go to deadlock and the public vote would determine the result. While Scherzinger was deliberating, she wanted the public vote to decide the outcome that week and sent the result to deadlock. Following this, Crow was voted out which led to Crow breaking down on stage and Scherzinger was booed off the stage and her future on the show was put in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dean Piper |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/12/11/nicole-scherzinger-faces-the-axe-after-us-x-factor-backlash-115875-23626040/ |title=Nicole Scherzinger faces the axe after US X Factor backlash \u2013 3am & Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> She subsequently received death threats from some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Geno |url=http://www.genogenogeno.com/2011/12/nicole-scherzinger-on-receiving-death.html |title=Geno's World: Nicole Scherzinger On Receiving Death Threats Over Rachel Crow's 'X Factor' Elimination |publisher=Genogenogeno.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Scherzinger was let go at the end of the season and later relocated to [[London]] to be a judge on the [[The X Factor (British series 9)|2012 series of the UK show]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thexfactorusa.com Official website]\n\n{{The X Factor U.S.}}\n{{The X Factor (U.S.) contestants}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (American season 1)}}\n[[Category:The X Factor (American TV series)|Season 1]]\n[[Category:2011 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United States 01]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c8:4300:0:e95b:c280:360e:3644", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eJudges' houses)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(American_season_1)"}

{"title_page": "Shirazi Turk", "text_new": "{{short description|14th-century poem by Hafez}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Shirazi Turk''''' is a ''[[ghazal]] (love poem)'' by the 14th-century Persian poet [[Hafez|H\u0101fez]] of [[Shiraz]]. It has been described as \"the most familiar of Hafez's poems in the English-speaking world\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 164.</ref> It was the first poem of Hafez to appear in English,<ref>Loloi (2002).</ref> when [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] made his paraphrase \"A Persian Song\" in 1771, based on a Latin version supplied by his friend [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]].  [[Edward Granville Browne]] wrote of this poem: \"I cannot find so many English verse-renderings of any other of the odes of \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93.\"<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, p. 304.</ref> It is the third poem in the collection (''[[Diwan (poetry)|d\u012bv\u0101n]]'') of Hafez's poems, which are arranged alphabetically by their rhymes.\n\nMore recently this ode has inspired a number of scholarly articles and some controversy. Should it be taken at face value, as a poem in which the poet describes his unrequited love for a handsome youth, and turns to wine as a consolation? Or does it also conceal a hidden [[Sufism|Sufi]] meaning describing the path of Love leading to union with God? Is the Turk male or female? Was he or she a real person or an imaginary one? Another topic that has been discussed is whether the poem is coherent, or whether it fails to have a unified theme.\n\nIn the century after Hafez's death, a famous anecdote was told of how the Mongol conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) met Hafez and criticised him for writing so disrespectfully of Bokhara and Samarkand in this poem. This story first appears in a work called ''Anis al-Nas'' by Shoja' Shirazi (1426),<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 11.</ref> and it was elaborated on in a collection of biographies of poets (''Tazker\u0101t a\u0161-\u0160o'ar\u0101'') completed in 1486 by [[Dawlatshah Samarqandi]]. If this meeting took place, which is not certain, it must have been during Tamerlane's first visit to Shiraz in 1387, two years before Hafez's death.<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, pp. 188, 282.</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that the poem is likely to have been written after 1370, when Tamerlane began to develop Samarkand and make it famous as his capital.<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 12.</ref> If so, it was probably written later in Hafez's life, since in 1370 he was 53 or 55.\n\n==The poem==\nThe transliteration given here is based on that approved by the United Nations in 2012, which represents the current pronunciation of educated speakers in Iran, except that to make scansion easier, the long vowels are marked with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b).<ref>''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/10th-uncsgn-docs/econf/E_CONF.101_118_Rev.1_Transcription%20symbols%20for%20Persian_Updated.pdf New Persian Romanization System.

The glottal stop is written ('), and ''kh'' (as in \"Khayy\u0101m\") is written ''x''.\n\nProse translations of the poem can be found in Clarke (1891), pp. 40\u201343, Windfuhr (1990), Hillmann (1995), and Ingenito (2018).

The version given above is that of Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941).<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 179</ref><ref>There is now a new critical edition of Hafez by Parviz Natel-Khanlari (1980, revised 1984); cf. Khorramshahi, Baha\u02be-al-Din and Ehsan Yarshater (2002, rev. 2012), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-vi \"Printed editions of the Div\u0101n of Hafez\"], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> However, of ten manuscripts examined by Mas'ud Farzaad, in fact only two have the above text.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> \n\nNine of the ten manuscripts agree on the order of verses 1\u20135 and 9. But concerning verses 6\u20138 there is more disagreement. One manuscript has the order 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 9, omitting 4, 5 and 8. Another manuscript omits verses 6 and 7. In the other manuscripts verses 6, 7, and 8 are found in various orders: 7, 8, 6; 8, 7, 6; and 6, 8, 7. \n\nBashiri (1979) argued that verses 6 and 7 are interpolations, and Rehder (1974) suggested that one or both of verses 4 and 8 might be spurious.<ref>Pritchett (1993), p. 128.</ref>\n\nEight of the manuscripts have a different version of verse 6 (see below). \n\n==A Sufic interpretation?==\nThe practice of [[Sufism]] (Islamic mysticism) was widespread in Iran during these centuries and greatly influenced Persian poetry.<ref>Pourjavady (2000).</ref> However, how far this poem of Hafez is to be taken in a mystical sense is disputed. One of those who interpreted it mystically is Clarke (1895), who explains that the Turk symbolises God, Samarkand and Bukhara signify this world and the next, the wine is the mysteries of love, and so on.<ref>Clarke, p. 40.</ref> \n\nHowever, not all scholars see a mystical interpretation in this poem. Gertrude Bell, for example, in her ''Poems from the Divan of Hafiz'' (1897), p. 129, wrote: \n\n:\"The whole poem has received a mystical interpretation which seems to me to add but little to its value or to its intelligibility.\"\n\nE. G. Browne in volume 3 of his ''Literary History of Persia'' wrote:<ref>Browne (1920), p. 299.</ref>\n\n:\"That many of the odes are to be taken in symbolic and mystical sense, few will deny; that others mean what they say, and celebrate a beauty not celestial and a wine not allegorical can hardly be questioned.\"\n\nSimilarly in the 16th century, the Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]], adopted a literal approach to Hafez's poetry, rejecting the excessively mystical interpretations of his predecessors S\u00fcruri and \u015eem\u02bfi.<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 277\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe ruler of Shiraz in Hafez's time, Shah Shoja', also found both aspects, spiritual and worldly, in Hafez's poems. He is said to have complained that Hafez's poetry was \"at one moment mystical, at another erotic and bacchanalian; now serious and spiritual, and again flippant and worldly\".<ref>Browne (1920), p. 281.</ref> Many modern commentators agree with Browne and Bell,<ref>Lewis (2002).</ref> and the majority accept the ode at its face value. \n\n[[Iraj Bashiri]] on the other hand argues strongly for a Sufic interpretation of this poem.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> He compares this poem with another of Hafez's ghazals, ''[[S\u012bne m\u0101l\u0101m\u0101l]]'' (\"My heart is brimful of pain\"), which is more obviously Sufic in character. According to Bashiri, both poems describe the seven stages of Love an initiate must go through to achieve union with the Divine (loss of heart, regret, ecstasy, loss of patience, loss of consciousness, loss of mind, annihilation). \n\nBashiri also draws attention to certain apparent astronomical references: the Sun (which was sometimes known as ''Tork-e falak'' \"the Turk of the firmament\"), Saturn (sometimes referred to as ''Hend\u016b-ye \u010darx'' \"the Indian of the sky\"),<ref>[https://www.vajehyab.com/?q=%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%DB%8C+%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%AE Dehkhoda's Dictionary].</ref> Venus and other bright planets (''L\u016bl\u012by\u0101n''), the seven planets (''Torkan''), the Pleiades (''Sorayy\u0101''), and the firmament itself (''falak''), all of which can be given Sufic meanings. His interpretation is at odds with that of Hillmann, who dismisses Bashiri's article as unscholarly.<ref>Hillmann (1980).</ref>\n\nHowever, even Hillmann acknowledges<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref> that in this poem there is a certain ambivalence \u2013 the ambiguity or ''\u012bh\u0101m'' for which Hafez is famous. \"The allusion to Joseph and Zulaykha may seem to some to be wholly in the spiritual area of the spectrum, whereas the minstrel-and-wine image in bayt 8 and the self-praise in bayt 9 perhaps can be taken only as part of the physical world.\" The question of the intent of the poem therefore is open to interpretation, some scholars taking it wholly as a physical description of love, others like Arberry as a \"grand philosophical utterance\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref>\n\n==Notes on individual verses==\nArberry (1946) points out that most of the features of this ode are traditional stock motifs from Persian love poetry, and he quotes some lines of Saadi where the same themes recur.\n\n===Verse 1===\nWhether the Turk is male or female is not expressed grammatically in Persian. The earliest translators of this poem all translated it as though the Turk were female, beginning with William Jones, whose version begins: \"Sweet maid, if thou wouldst charm my sight...\".<ref>Arberry (1946).</ref>\n\nIn fact, however, although in the great Persian narrative epics and romances the love interest was always female, there was also a long tradition of love poetry in Persian in which, in the great majority of cases, the person whose beauty was praised was male.<ref name=EIr>EIr (2004).</ref> Among the poets who wrote love poems of this kind were [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] (11th century), [[Manuchehri]] (11th century), [[Sanai]] (12th century), [[Anvari]] (12th century), [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi|Iraqi]] (13th century), [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] (13th century) and [[Awhadi Maraghai|Awhadi]] (14th century). Often the object of the poet's admiration was described as a \"Turk\" (Turks were supposed to be especially good-looking),<ref>Browne (1920), p. 228.</ref> as in the couplet below from a ''[[qasida]]'' of Manuchehri (see [[The Turkish harpist (Manuchehri)]]):<ref>Manuchehri, [https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ qaside 39].</ref> \n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u06af\u060c \u0686\u0646\u06af}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0632\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0635\u062f \u0641\u0631\u0633\u0646\u06af\u060c \u0633\u0646\u06af}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012bni \u0101n Tork-\u012b ke \u016b \u010don barzanad bar <u>\u010dang</u> \u010dang}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|az del-\u0113 abd\u0101l begr\u012bzad be sad far<u>sang</u> sang}}\n\n:Do you see that Turk, who when he places his hand ({{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}) on the harp ({{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}),\n:from the heart of devotees, a stone flees for a hundred [[league (unit)|leagues]]?\n\nSaadi, who like Hafez was from Shiraz, used the phrase \"Shirazi Turk\" a century before Hafez:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh578/ Saadi Ghazal 578 (Ganjur edition), verse 5].</ref><ref>Ingenito, Domenico; in Pfeiffer, Judith (ed.)

It is possible that he was even an imaginary figure introduced as the topic of the poem.\n\nThe 16th-century Bosnian-Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]] wrote:<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 284\u20135.</ref> \n\n:\"Turk: the word originally means the [[Tatars|Tatar]] people. Since Tatars are known as cruel, merciless and bloody people, Persian poets metaphorically compare their beloveds to them. And this is why these poets call their beloveds 'Turks'.\" \n\nBut Sudi also reports another theory: \n:\"Some people from Shiraz say that many soldiers in [the Mongol ruler] [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]]\u2019s army made the city of Shiraz their home and lived there for successive generations. So, literally speaking, it is not incorrect to call their descendants 'Turks of Shiraz'.\"\n\nA suggestion by Hafez's editor [[Qasem Ghani]] that the Turk might have been the son of [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja']], the ruler of the time, is dismissed as \"improbable\" by Hillmann in view of the fact that \"Turk\" usually simply means \"beloved\" and that the phrase had already been used by Saadi.<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 180.</ref>\n\nThe ''x\u0101l-e Hend\u016b'' (\"mole of an Indian\" i.e. dark in colour) was regarded as a symbol of beauty on the face of the beloved. The phrase also appears in a ''ghazal'' of Saadi, quoted by Arberry, in which Saadi contrasts the darkness of the mole with the paleness of the beloved's face:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh479/ Saadi, ''ghazal'' 479], verse 9; cf.

Those who interpret this poem non-mystically do not give a satisfactory motivation for this verse. However, in Sufism, the story was widely used as an example. John Renard writes:<ref>Renard (2009), p. 260.</ref> \n:\"Sufi poets developed the character's personality well beyond the scriptural stories, understanding her as a type of the lover of God who loses her wits in the presence of the divine Beauty. Major poets, including [[Jami]] and [[Rumi]], for example, depict her most sympathetically as a \"model\" of the mystical seeker. They emphasise especially that Zulaykh\u0101 was not culpable for her attempted seduction of Joseph, for she was hopelessly under the spell of bewilderment.\"\n\n===Verse 6===\nEight of the manuscripts have a different version of verse 6, namely:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u062f\u0645 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u06cc \u0648 \u062e\u0631\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0645 \u0639\u0641\u0627\u06a9 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u0644\u062e \u0645\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u062f \u0644\u0628 \u0644\u0639\u0644 \u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u062e\u0627 \u0631\u0627}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|bad-am goft\u012b o xorsand-am; * 'af\u0101kall\u0101h karam kard\u012b!}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|kal\u0101m-\u0113 <u>talx</u> m\u012bz\u012bbad * lab-\u0113 la'l-\u0113 \u0161ekarx\u0101-r\u0101}}\n:\"You spoke harshly to me and I am pleased; God bless you, you did me a kindness!\n:bitter speech beautifies a ruby-coloured sugar-chewing lip.\"\n\nThe first of these two lines is actually a quotation from a ''[[ghazal]]'' of [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]].<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh536/ Saadi ghazal 536], verse 3; cf.

Arberry writes of the last verse: \"The 'clasp' theme here used is a very common one, but its present treatment is scarcely surpassed for beauty in the whole ''D\u012bv\u0101n''.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 707.</ref> Hillmann writes: \"A first impression of the 'Turk of Shiraz' is of a texture of [[hyperbole]], [[paradox]], a sense of the ultimate or perfection, eloquence, and seriousness, with familiar images and conceits given new vitality through new combination and given form by means of verse patterning.\"<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 167.</ref>\n\nSome critics, however, have questioned the coherence or unity of the poem, beginning with William Jones's friend and tutor in Persian, Count [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]], who wrote in 1768 \"I did not translate the poem into Latin verse, on account of the incoherence of the verses\". Jones himself in his version used the phrase \"Like orient pearls at random strung\".<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 703.</ref> The chief critic in this area is Hillman, who wrote: \"One might conclude that the \"Turk of Shiraz\" is not a wholly successful poem precisely because it seems lacking in unity, no other aspect or feature of the ghazal having been demonstrated to compensate for this lack.\"<ref> Hillmann (1975), p. 175.</ref>\n\nDefending the poem from such criticism, Arberry finds only two themes in it: \"The principal theme is \u2013 the fair charmer, beautiful, proud, unapproachable, the human, this-worldly reflection of the immortal loveliness of the Divine spirit. ... The subsidiary theme is \u2013 wine (and music) are the sole consolation of the lover, to compensate his sorrow over the incapacity of his love, and the transitory nature of mundane affairs.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 706.</ref> He scorns the idea that the poem has no unity. Rehder finds that rather than thematic unity, the poem has \"an obvious unity of thought and mood\".<ref>Rehder (1974), quoted by Pritchett (1993), p. 121.</ref>\n\n==Other poems by Hafez==\nThere are articles on the following poems by Hafez on Wikipedia.

It has been described as \"the most familiar of Hafez's poems in the English-speaking world\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 164.</ref> It was the first poem of Hafez to appear in English,<ref>Loloi (2002).</ref> when [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] made his paraphrase \"A Persian Song\" in 1771, based on a Latin version supplied by his friend [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]].  [[Edward Granville Browne]] wrote of this poem: \"I cannot find so many English verse-renderings of any other of the odes of \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93.\"<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, p. 304.</ref> It is the third poem in the collection (''[[Diwan (poetry)|d\u012bv\u0101n]]'') of Hafez's poems, which are arranged alphabetically by their rhymes.\n\nMore recently this ode has inspired a number of scholarly articles and some controversy. Should it be taken at face value, as a poem in which the poet describes his unrequited love for a handsome youth, and turns to wine as a consolation? Or does it also conceal a hidden [[Sufism|Sufi]] meaning describing the path of Love leading to union with God? Is the Turk male or female? Was he or she a real person or an imaginary one? Another topic that has been discussed is whether the poem is coherent, or whether it fails to have a unified theme.\n\nIn the century after Hafez's death, a famous anecdote was told of how the Mongol conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) met Hafez and criticised him for writing so disrespectfully of Bokhara and Samarkand in this poem. This story first appears in a work called ''Anis al-Nas'' by Shoja' Shirazi (1426),<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 11.</ref> and it was elaborated on in a collection of biographies of poets (''Tazker\u0101t a\u0161-\u0160o'ar\u0101'') completed in 1486 by [[Dawlatshah Samarqandi]]. If this meeting took place, which is not certain, it must have been during Tamerlane's first visit to Shiraz in 1387, two years before Hafez's death.<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, pp. 188, 282.</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that the poem is likely to have been written after 1370, when Tamerlane began to develop Samarkand and make it famous as his capital.<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 12.</ref> If so, it was probably written later in Hafez's life, since in 1370 he was 53 or 55.\n\n==The poem==\nThe transliteration given here is based on that approved by the United Nations in 2012, which represents the current pronunciation of educated speakers in Iran, except that to make scansion easier, the long vowels are marked with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b).<ref>''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/10th-uncsgn-docs/econf/E_CONF.101_118_Rev.1_Transcription%20symbols%20for%20Persian_Updated.pdf New Persian Romanization System.

The version given above is that of Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941).<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 179</ref><ref>There is now a new critical edition of Hafez by Parviz Natel-Khanlari (1980, revised 1984); cf. Khorramshahi, Baha\u02be-al-Din and Ehsan Yarshater (2002, rev. 2012), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-vi \"Printed editions of the Div\u0101n of Hafez\"], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> However, of ten manuscripts examined by Mas'ud Farzaad, in fact only two have the above text.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> \n\nNine of the ten manuscripts agree on the order of verses 1\u20135 and 9. But concerning verses 6\u20138 there is more disagreement. One manuscript has the order 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 9, omitting 4, 5 and 8. Another manuscript omits verses 6 and 7. In the other manuscripts verses 6, 7, and 8 are found in various orders: 7, 8, 6; 8, 7, 6; and 6, 8, 7. \n\nBashiri (1979) argued that verses 6 and 7 are interpolations, and Rehder (1974) suggested that one or both of verses 4 and 8 might be spurious.<ref>Pritchett (1993), p. 128.</ref>\n\nEight of the manuscripts have a different version of verse 6 (see below). \n\n==A Sufic interpretation?==\nThe practice of [[Sufism]] (Islamic mysticism) was widespread in Iran during these centuries and greatly influenced Persian poetry.<ref>Pourjavady (2000).</ref> However, how far this poem of Hafez is to be taken in a mystical sense is disputed. One of those who interpreted it mystically is Clarke (1895), who explains that the Turk symbolises God, Samarkand and Bukhara signify this world and the next, the wine is the mysteries of love, and so on.<ref>Clarke, p. 40.</ref> \n\nHowever, not all scholars see a mystical interpretation in this poem. Gertrude Bell, for example, in her ''Poems from the Divan of Hafiz'' (1897), p. 129, wrote: \n\n:\"The whole poem has received a mystical interpretation which seems to me to add but little to its value or to its intelligibility.\"\n\nE. G. Browne in volume 3 of his ''Literary History of Persia'' wrote:<ref>Browne (1920), p. 299.</ref>\n\n:\"That many of the odes are to be taken in symbolic and mystical sense, few will deny; that others mean what they say, and celebrate a beauty not celestial and a wine not allegorical can hardly be questioned.\"\n\nSimilarly in the 16th century, the Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]], adopted a literal approach to Hafez's poetry, rejecting the excessively mystical interpretations of his predecessors S\u00fcruri and \u015eem\u02bfi.<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 277\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe ruler of Shiraz in Hafez's time, Shah Shoja', also found both aspects, spiritual and worldly, in Hafez's poems. He is said to have complained that Hafez's poetry was \"at one moment mystical, at another erotic and bacchanalian; now serious and spiritual, and again flippant and worldly\".<ref>Browne (1920), p. 281.</ref> Many modern commentators agree with Browne and Bell,<ref>Lewis (2002).</ref> and the majority accept the ode at its face value. \n\n[[Iraj Bashiri]] on the other hand argues strongly for a Sufic interpretation of this poem.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> He compares this poem with another of Hafez's ghazals, ''[[S\u012bne m\u0101l\u0101m\u0101l]]'' (\"My heart is brimful of pain\"), which is more obviously Sufic in character. According to Bashiri, both poems describe the seven stages of Love an initiate must go through to achieve union with the Divine (loss of heart, regret, ecstasy, loss of patience, loss of consciousness, loss of mind, annihilation). \n\nBashiri also draws attention to certain apparent astronomical references: the Sun (which was sometimes known as ''Tork-e falak'' \"the Turk of the firmament\"), Saturn (sometimes referred to as ''Hend\u016b-ye \u010darx'' \"the Indian of the sky\"),<ref>[https://www.vajehyab.com/?q=%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%DB%8C+%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%AE Dehkhoda's Dictionary].</ref> Venus and other bright planets (''L\u016bl\u012by\u0101n''), the seven planets (''Torkan''), the Pleiades (''Sorayy\u0101''), and the firmament itself (''falak''), all of which can be given Sufic meanings. His interpretation is at odds with that of Hillmann, who dismisses Bashiri's article as unscholarly.<ref>Hillmann (1980).</ref>\n\nHowever, even Hillmann acknowledges<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref> that in this poem there is a certain ambivalence \u2013 the ambiguity or ''\u012bh\u0101m'' for which Hafez is famous. \"The allusion to Joseph and Zulaykha may seem to some to be wholly in the spiritual area of the spectrum, whereas the minstrel-and-wine image in bayt 8 and the self-praise in bayt 9 perhaps can be taken only as part of the physical world.\" The question of the intent of the poem therefore is open to interpretation, some scholars taking it wholly as a physical description of love, others like Arberry as a \"grand philosophical utterance\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref>\n\n==Notes on individual verses==\nArberry (1946) points out that most of the features of this ode are traditional stock motifs from Persian love poetry, and he quotes some lines of Saadi where the same themes recur.\n\n===Verse 1===\nWhether the Turk is male or female is not expressed grammatically in Persian. The earliest translators of this poem all translated it as though the Turk were female, beginning with William Jones, whose version begins: \"Sweet maid, if thou wouldst charm my sight...\".<ref>Arberry (1946).</ref>\n\nIn fact, however, although in the great Persian narrative epics and romances the love interest was always female, there was also a long tradition of love poetry in Persian in which, in the great majority of cases, the person whose beauty was praised was male.<ref name=EIr>EIr (2004).</ref> Among the poets who wrote love poems of this kind were [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] (11th century), [[Manuchehri]] (11th century), [[Sanai]] (12th century), [[Anvari]] (12th century), [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi|Iraqi]] (13th century), [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] (13th century) and [[Awhadi Maraghai|Awhadi]] (14th century).

It is possible that he was even an imaginary figure introduced as the topic of the poem.\n\nThe 16th-century Bosnian-Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]] wrote:<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 284\u20135.</ref> \n\n:\"Turk: the word originally means the [[Tatars|Tatar]] people. Since Tatars are known as cruel, merciless and bloody people, Persian poets metaphorically compare their beloveds to them. And this is why these poets call their beloveds 'Turks'.\" \n\nBut Sudi also reports another theory: \n:\"Some people from Shiraz say that many soldiers in [the Mongol ruler] [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]]\u2019s army made the city of Shiraz their home and lived there for successive generations. So, literally speaking, it is not incorrect to call their descendants 'Turks of Shiraz'.\"\n\nA suggestion by Hafez's editor [[Qasem Ghani]] that the Turk might have been the son of [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja']], the ruler of the time, is dismissed as \"improbable\" by Hillmann in view of the fact that \"Turk\" usually simply means \"beloved\" and that the phrase had already been used by Saadi.<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 180.</ref>\n\nThe ''x\u0101l-e Hend\u016b'' (\"mole of an Indian\" i.e. dark in colour) was regarded as a symbol of beauty on the face of the beloved.

Arberry writes of the last verse: \"The 'clasp' theme here used is a very common one, but its present treatment is scarcely surpassed for beauty in the whole ''D\u012bv\u0101n''.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 707.</ref> Hillmann writes: \"A first impression of the 'Turk of Shiraz' is of a texture of [[hyperbole]], [[paradox]], a sense of the ultimate or perfection, eloquence, and seriousness, with familiar images and conceits given new vitality through new combination and given form by means of verse patterning.\"<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 167.</ref>\n\nSome critics, however, have questioned the coherence or unity of the poem, beginning with William Jones's friend and tutor in Persian, Count [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]], who wrote in 1768 \"I did not translate the poem into Latin verse, on account of the incoherence of the verses\". Jones himself in his version used the phrase \"Like orient pearls at random strung\".<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 703.</ref> The chief critic in this area is Hillman, who wrote: \"One might conclude that the \"Turk of Shiraz\" is not a wholly successful poem precisely because it seems lacking in unity, no other aspect or feature of the ghazal having been demonstrated to compensate for this lack.\"<ref> Hillmann (1975), p. 175.</ref>\n\nDefending the poem from such criticism, Arberry finds only two themes in it: \"The principal theme is \u2013 the fair charmer, beautiful, proud, unapproachable, the human, this-worldly reflection of the immortal loveliness of the Divine spirit. ... The subsidiary theme is \u2013 wine (and music) are the sole consolation of the lover, to compensate his sorrow over the incapacity of his love, and the transitory nature of mundane affairs.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 706.</ref> He scorns the idea that the poem has no unity. Rehder finds that rather than thematic unity, the poem has \"an obvious unity of thought and mood\".<ref>Rehder (1974), quoted by Pritchett (1993), p. 121.</ref>\n\n==Other poems by Hafez==\nThere are articles on the following poems by Hafez on Wikipedia.

He worked on the legal case that led to the historic [[George Hugo Boldt|Boldt]] Decision of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]].

Other groups also gained momentum, with organizations such as the [[American Indian Movement]] staging events to attract media and public attention for education.\n\nThe book helped draw attention to the Native American struggle. Focused on the Native American goal of [[sovereignty]] without political and social assimilation, the book stood as a hallmark of [[Native American Self-Determination]] at the time. The [[American Anthropological Association]] sponsored a panel in response to ''Custer Died for Your Sins''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/native/review.html|title=Native Americans and Archaeologists: Review - Archaeology Magazine Archive|website=archive.archaeology.org|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> The book was reissued in 1988 with a new preface by the author, noting, \"The Indian world has changed so substantially since the first publication of this book that some things contained in it seem new again.\"\n\nDeloria wrote and edited many subsequent books and 200 articles, focusing on issues as they related to Native Americans, such as education and religion.<ref name=mnsu/> In 1995, Deloria argued in his book ''[[Red Earth, White Lies]]'' that the [[Beringia|Bering Strait Land Bridge]] never existed, and that the ancestors of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] had not [[Settlement of the Americas|migrated to the Americas]] over such a land bridge, as has been the predominant theory among [[archaeologists]] and anthropologists.
