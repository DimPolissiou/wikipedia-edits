The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the [[Anglo-Frisian languages]], are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the [[Ingvaeonic|Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages]], though this grouping remains debated.{{sfn|Bammesberger|1992|p=30}} Old English evolved into [[Middle English]], which in turn evolved into Modern English.{{sfn|Robinson|1992}} Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including [[Scots language|Scots]]{{sfn|Romaine|1982|pp=56\u201365}} and the extinct [[Fingallian]] and [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy (Yola)]] dialects of Ireland.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86\u201387}}\n\nLike [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], the development of English in the [[British Isles]] isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences. It has since evolved considerably. English is not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with any continental Germanic language, differing in [[lexis (linguistics)|vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[phonology]], although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.{{sfn|Harbert|2007}}\n\nUnlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]]. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic [[clades]]\u2014but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a [[mixed language]] or a [[Creole language|creole]]\u2014a theory called the [[Middle English creole hypothesis]]. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=264\u2013265}}{{sfn|Watts|2011|loc=Chapter 4}}\n\nEnglish is classified as a Germanic language because it shares [[language change|innovations]] with other Germanic languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].{{sfn|Durrell|2006}} These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called [[Proto-Germanic]]. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] classes, the use of [[modal verb]]s, and the sound changes affecting [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] consonants, known as [[Grimm's law|Grimm's]] and [[Verner's law]]s. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see {{section link|Phonological history of Old English|Palatalization}}).{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|van der Auwera|1994}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of English}}\n\n=== Proto-Germanic to Old English ===\n{{Main|Old English}}\n\n[[File:Beowulf Cotton MS Vitellius A XV f. 132r.jpg|thumb|The opening to the Old English epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[manuscript|handwritten]] in [[Half-uncial|half-uncial script]]:<br />{{lang|ang|H\u01bf\u00e6t \u01bf\u0113 G\u0101rde/na ing\u0113ar dagum \u00fe\u0113od cyninga / \u00ferym ge frunon...}}<br />\"Listen!

Old English developed from a set of [[Ingvaeonic languages|North Sea Germanic dialects]] originally spoken along the coasts of [[Frisia]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Jutland]], and Southern [[Sweden]] by Germanic tribes known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]]. From the 5th century CE, the Anglo-Saxons [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|settled Britain]] as [[End of Roman rule in Britain|the Roman economy and administration collapsed]]. By the 7th century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons [[Celtic language-death in England|became dominant in Britain]], replacing the languages of [[Roman Britain]] (43\u2013409 CE): [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by the [[Roman occupation of Britain|Roman occupation]].{{sfn|Collingwood|Myres|1936}}{{sfn|Graddol|Leith|Swann et al.|2007}}{{sfn|Blench|Spriggs|1999}} ''England'' and ''English'' (originally {{lang|ang|\u00c6nglaland}} and {{lang|ang|\u00c6nglisc}}) are named after the Angles.{{sfn|Bosworth|Toller|1921}}\n\nOld English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects ([[Mercian dialect|Mercian]] and [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]]) and the Saxon dialects, [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]].{{sfn|Campbell|1959|p=4}} Through the educational reforms of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of [[Wessex]], the West Saxon dialect became the [[standard language|standard written variety]].{{sfn|Toon|1992|loc=Chapter: Old English Dialects}} The [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, ''[[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]]'', is written in Northumbrian.{{sfn|Donoghue|2008}} Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the [[Scots language]] developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic script]].{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}} By the 6th century, a [[Old English Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]] was adopted, written with [[half-uncial]] [[letterform]]s. It included the runic letters ''[[wynn]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}} and ''[[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00fe}}}}, and the modified Latin letters ''[[eth]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00f0}}}}, and ''[[\u00c6|ash]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00e6}}}}.{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}}{{sfn|Denison|Hogg|2006|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nOld English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern [[German language|German]], and its closest relative is [[Old Frisian]]. [[Old English grammar|Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs]] had many more [[Inflectional morphology|inflectional endings and forms]], and word order was [[Pragmatic word order|much freer]] than in Modern English. Modern English has [[grammatical case|case forms]] in pronouns (''he'', ''him'', ''his'') and has a few verb inflections (''speak'', ''speaks'', ''speaking'', ''spoke'', ''spoken''), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] endings.{{sfn|Hogg|1992|loc=Chapter 3.

Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating gnashing.\n|source= [[John of Trevisa]], ca. 1385{{sfn|Hogg|2006|pp=360\u2013361}}\n}}\n\nFrom the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through [[language contact]] into [[Middle English]]. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200\u20131450.\n\nFirst, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with [[Old Norse]], a [[North Germanic]] language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the [[Danelaw]] area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in [[the Midlands]] around [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]], and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in direct contact with Norse speakers. An element of Norse influence that persists in all English varieties today is the group of pronouns beginning with ''th-'' (''they, them, their'') which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with {{lang|ang|h-}} ({{lang|ang|hie, him, hera}}).{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=284\u2013290}}\n\nWith the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with the [[Old Norman]] language, a [[Romance language]] closely related to Modern [[French language|French]]. The Norman language in England eventually developed into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of [[loanwords]] related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=39}} Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,{{sfn|Lass|1992}} and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.{{sfn|Fischer|van der Wurff|2006|pages=111\u201313}} In the [[Wycliffe Bible]] of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written:\n\n: {{lang|enm|Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis}}<ref>{{cite web| last = Wycliffe | first = John | url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wycliffe/wycbible-all.pdf | publisher = Wesley NNU | title = Bible}}</ref>\n\nHere the plural suffix {{lang|enm|-n}} on the verb ''have'' is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and [[Thomas Malory|Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horobin |first1=Simon |title=Chaucer's Middle English |url=https://opencanterburytales.dsl.lsu.edu/refmideng/ |website=The Open Access Companion to the Canterbury Tales |publisher=Louisiana State University |accessdate=24 November 2019 |quote=The only appearances of their and them in Chaucer\u2019s works are in the Reeve\u2019s Tale, where they form part of the Northern dialect spoken by the two Cambridge students, Aleyn and John, demonstrating that at this time they were still perceived to be Northernisms}}</ref>\n\n=== Early Modern English ===\n{{Main|Early Modern English}}\n\n[[File:Great Vowel Shift2a.svg|right|upright=1.36|thumb|Graphic representation of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level]]\n\nThe next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500\u20131700). Early Modern English was characterised by the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (1350\u20131700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a [[chain shift]], meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. [[Mid vowel|Mid]] and [[open vowel]]s were [[raising (phonology)|raised]], and [[close vowel]]s were [[vowel breaking|broken]] into [[diphthong]]s. For example, the word ''bite'' was originally pronounced as the word ''beet'' is today, and the second vowel in the word ''about'' was pronounced as the word ''boot'' is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.{{sfn|Lass|2000}}{{sfn|G\u00f6rlach|1991|pp=66\u201370}}\n\nEnglish began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Around 1430, the [[Court of Chancery]] in [[Westminster]] began using English in its [[writ|official documents]], and a new standard form of Middle English, known as [[Chancery Standard]], developed from the dialects of London and the [[East Midlands English|East Midlands]]. In 1476, [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.{{sfn|Nevalainen|Tieken-Boon van Ostade|2006|pages=274\u201379}} Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and the [[King James Version|translation of the Bible]] commissioned by [[James VI and I|King James I]]. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn \u0261n sw/}} in ''knight'', ''gnat'', and ''sword'' were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.{{sfn|Cercignani|1981}}\n\nIn the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:\n: ''The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests''{{sfn|Lass|2006|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nThis exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of ''of'' instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (''ayre'') and word replacements (''bird'' originally meaning \"nestling\" had replaced OE ''fugol'').{{sfn|Lass|2006|pp=46-47}}\n\n=== Spread of Modern English ===\n\nBy the late 18th century, the [[British Empire]] had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.{{sfn|How English evolved into a global language|2010}}{{sfn|The Routes of English}} England continued to form new colonies, and these later developed their own norms for speech and writing. English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent nations that had multiple [[indigenous language]]s opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.{{sfn|Romaine|2006|p=586}}{{sfn|Mufwene|2006|p=614}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013|pp=81\u201386}} In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a [[superpower]] following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the [[BBC]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Colin|title=''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education'', page CCCXI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC|date=August 1998|page=311|publisher=Multilingual Matters Ltd|accessdate=9 August 2015|isbn=978-1-85359-362-8}}</ref> and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.{{sfn|McCrum|MacNeil|Cran|2003|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAs Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 [[Samuel Johnson]] published his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, [[Noah Webster]] published the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English language]]'' to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1\u201356}}\n\nIn modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as ''he'' and ''him'', ''she'' and ''her'', ''who'' and ''whom''), and SVO word-order is mostly fixed.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1\u201356}} Some changes, such as the use of [[do-support]] have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word \"do\" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=2|quote=Other changes such as the spread and regularisation of do support began in the thirteenth century and were more or less complete in the nineteenth. Although do coexisted with the simple verb forms in negative statements from the early ninth century, obligatoriness was not complete until the nineteenth. The increasing use of do periphrasis coincides with the fixing of SVO word order. Not surprisingly, do is first widely used in interrogatives, where the word order is disrupted, and then later spread to negatives.}} Now, do-support with the verb ''have'' is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in ''-ing'', appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as ''had been being built'' are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. ''dreamed'' instead of ''dreamt''), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. ''more polite'' instead of ''politer''). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power.{{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=18\u201319}}{{sfn|Mair|Leech|2006}}{{sfn|Mair|2006}}\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\n{{anchor|Geographic distribution}}\n{{See also|List of territorial entities where English is an official language|Geographical distribution of English speakers|List of countries by English-speaking population|English-speaking world}}\n[[File:Map of English native speakers.png|upright=1.16|thumb|Percentage of English native speakers]]\n[[File:Percentage of English speakers by country as of 2014.png|upright=1.16|thumb|Percentage of English speakers by country\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; background:none;\"\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|\n{{legend|#225500|80\u2013100%}}\n{{legend|#44aa00|60\u201380%}}\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|\n{{legend|#66ff00|40\u201360%}}\n{{legend|#99ff55|20\u201340%}}\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|\n{{legend|#ccffaa|0\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#b9b9b9|Not available}}\n|}]]\n\n{{as of|2016}}, 400&nbsp;million people spoke English as their [[first language]], and 1.1&nbsp;billion spoke it as a secondary language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Which countries are best at English as a second language?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/which-countries-are-best-at-english-as-a-second-language-4d24c8c8-6cf6-4067-a753-4c82b4bc865b|website=World Economic Forum|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref> English is the [[List of languages by total number of speakers|largest language by number of speakers]].

The \"inner circle\"{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when [[lingua franca|people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world]].\n\n=== Three circles of English-speaking countries ===\n[[Braj Kachru]] distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a [[Three Circles of English|three circles model]].{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} In his model,\n* the \"inner circle\" countries have large communities of native speakers of English,\n* \"outer circle\" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and \n* \"expanding circle\" countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language.\n\nKachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=196}}\n\n[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.svg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's ''Three Circles of English'']]\nCountries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English.

They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}}\n\nIn the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the \"expanding circle\".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=4}} The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=5}} For example, in the [[Netherlands]] and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,{{sfn|European Commission|2012}} and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the \"outer circle\" and \"expanding circle\". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=197}}\n\nMany users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=198}} Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.{{sfn|Bao|2006}} Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=7}}\n\n=== Pluricentric English ===\n{{Pie chart\n|caption=Pie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in \"inner circle\" English-speaking countries.

In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus ''nip'' has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than ''nib'' {{IPA|[n\u026a\u02d1b\u0325]}} ([[#Vowels|see below]]).{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pages=47\u201353}} \n* lenis stops: ''bin'' {{IPA|[b\u0325\u026a\u02d1n]}}, ''about'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8ba\u028at]}}, ''nib'' {{IPA|[n\u026a\u02d1b\u0325]}}\n* fortis stops: ''pin'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}}; ''spin'' {{IPA|[sp\u026an]}}; ''happy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u00e6pi]}}; ''nip'' {{IPA|[n\u026ap\u031a]}} or {{IPA|[n\u026a\u0294p]}}\n\nIn RP, the lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}}, has two main [[allophone]]s (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain {{IPA|[l]}}, as in ''light'', and the dark or [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarised]] {{IPA|[\u026b]}}, as in ''full''.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=13}} GA has dark ''l'' in most cases.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=41}}\n* clear ''l'': RP ''light'' {{IPA|[la\u026at]}}\n* dark ''l'': RP and GA ''full'' {{IPA|[f\u028a\u026b]}}, GA ''light'' {{IPA|[\u026ba\u026at]}}\n\nAll [[sonorant]]s (liquids {{IPA|/l, r/}} and nasals {{IPA|/m, n, \u014b/}}) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|pages=56\u201359}}\n* voiceless sonorants: ''clay'' {{IPA|[kl\u0325e\u026a\u032f]}}; ''snow'' RP {{IPA|[sn\u0325\u0259\u028a\u032f]}}, GA {{IPA|[sn\u0325o\u028a\u032f]}}\n* syllabic sonorants: ''paddle'' {{IPA|[\u02c8pad.l\u0329]}}, ''button'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028ct.n\u0329]}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n{{Main|English phonology#Vowels}}\n\nThe pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent.

In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.\n\nIn both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically [[clipping (phonetics)|shortened before fortis consonants]] in the same [[syllable]], like {{IPA|/t t\u0283 f/}}, but not before lenis consonants like {{IPA|/d d\u0292 v/}} or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of ''rich'' {{IPA|[r\u026at\u0283]}}, ''neat'' {{IPA|[nit]}}, and ''safe'' {{IPA|[se\u026a\u032ff]}} are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ''ridge'' {{IPA|[r\u026a\u02d1d\u0292]}}, ''need'' {{IPA|[ni\u02d1d]}}, and ''save'' {{IPA|[se\u02d1\u026a\u032fv]}}, and the vowel of ''light'' {{IPA|[la\u026a\u032ft]}} is shorter than that of ''lie'' {{IPA|[la\u02d1\u026a\u032f]}}. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=46\u201350}}\n\nThe vowel {{IPA|/\u0259/}} only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.{{sfn|Cruttenden|2014|p=138}}{{sfn|Flemming|Johnson|2007}} Some dialects do not contrast {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}} in unstressed positions, so that ''rabbit'' and ''abbot'' rhyme and ''Lenin'' and ''Lennon'' are homophonous, a dialect feature called [[weak vowel merger]].{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=167}} GA {{IPA|/\u025cr/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} are realised as an [[r-colored vowel|''r''-coloured vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025a]}}, as in ''further'' {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u025a\u00f0\u025a]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u025cr\u00f0\u0259r/}}), which in RP is realised as {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u0259\u02d0\u00f0\u0259]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u025c\u02d0\u00f0\u0259/}}).{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=121}}\n\n=== Phonotactics ===\nAn English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in ''sprint'' {{IPA|/spr\u026ant/}}, and end with up to four, as in ''texts'' {{IPA|/teksts/}}. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word ''strengths'' {{IPA|/str\u025b\u014bk\u03b8s/}} is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in ''play''; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in ''fly'' or ''sly''; ''s'' and a voiceless stop, as in ''stay''; and ''s'', a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in ''string''.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=60}} Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: {{IPA|/h/}} can only occur in syllable-initial position, and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} only in syllable-final position.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|pages=537\u2013538}}\n\n=== Stress, rhythm and intonation ===\n{{See also|Stress and vowel reduction in English|Intonation in English}}\n\n[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] plays an important role in English. Certain [[syllable]]s are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently [[vowel reduction|reduced]] while vowels in stressed syllables are not.{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|1999|page=42}} Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as ''can'', have [[weak and strong forms in English|weak and strong forms]] depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.\n\nStress in English is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word ''contract'' is stressed on the first syllable ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u0252|n|t|r|\u00e6|k|t}} {{respell|KON|trakt}}) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable ({{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|n|\u02c8|t|r|\u00e6|k|t}} {{respell|k\u0259n|TRAKT|'}}) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb.{{sfn|Oxford Learner's Dictionary|2015|loc=Entry \"contract\"}}{{sfn|Merriam Webster|2015|loc=Entry \"contract\"}}{{sfn|Macquarie Dictionary|2015|loc=Entry \"contract\"}} Here stress is connected to [[vowel reduction]]: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to {{IPA|/\u0259/}}. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. ''a burnout'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u025c\u02d0r|n|a\u028a|t}}) versus ''to burn out'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u025c\u02d0r|n|_|\u02c8|a\u028a|t}}), and ''a hotdog'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0252|t|d|\u0252|g}}) versus ''a hot dog'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0252|t|_|\u02c8|d|\u0252|g}}).{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=66}}\n\nIn terms of [[rhythm]], English is generally described as a [[stress-timed]] language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sentence stress |url=https://esol.britishcouncil.org/content/teachers/staff-room/teaching-articles/sentence-stress |website=ESOL Nexus |publisher=British Council |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened.

The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[Hiberno English|Ireland]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] and [[South African English|South Africa]] have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table \"Varieties of Standard English and their features\".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nEnglish has undergone many [[Phonological history of English|historical sound changes]], some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] and [[Canadian Shift]] have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |date=2000  |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Lass |title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume II |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=90,118,610 |isbn=0521264758}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |date=2000  |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Lass |title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=80,656 |isbn=0521264766}}</ref>\n\nSome dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a [[voicelessness|voiceless]] {{IPAblink|\u028d}} sound in ''whine'' that contrasts with the voiced {{IPA|[w]}} in ''wine'', but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced {{IPA|[w]}}, a dialect feature called [[wine\u2013whine merger|''wine''\u2013''whine'' merger]]. The unvoiced velar fricative sound {{IPA|/x/}} is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes ''loch'' {{IPA|/l\u0254x/}} from ''lock'' {{IPA|/l\u0254k/}}. Accents like [[Cockney]] with \"''h''-dropping\" lack the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}}, and dialects with [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]] and [[th-fronting|''th''-fronting]] like [[African American Vernacular English|African American Vernacular]] and [[Estuary English]] do not have the dental fricatives {{IPA|/\u03b8, \u00f0/}}, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops {{IPA|/t, d/}} or labiodental fricatives {{IPA|/f, v/}}.{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Giegerich|1992|page=36}} Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as [[Yod-dropping|''yod''-dropping]], [[yod-coalescence|''yod''-coalescence]], and reduction of consonant clusters.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=Accents of English |date=1982 |isbn=0521285402}}</ref>\n\n[[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] vary in their pronunciation of historical {{IPA|/r/}} after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the [[syllable coda]]). GA is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic dialect]], meaning that it pronounces {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses {{IPA|/r/}} in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide {{IPA|/r/}} like RP or keep it like GA.{{sfn|Lass|2000|p=114}}\n\nThere is complex dialectal variation in words with the [[Phonological history of English short A|open front]] and [[Phonological history of English low back vowels|open back vowels]] {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u0251\u02d0 \u0252 \u0254\u02d0/}}. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u0251 \u0254/}},{{sfn|Wells|1982|pages=xviii\u2013xix}} and in Canadian English, they merge to two {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u0251/}}.{{sfn|Wells|1982|page=493}} In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table \"Dialects and open vowels\" shows this variation with [[lexical set]]s in which these sounds occur.\n\n== Grammar ==\nAs is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional [[case system]] in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. Only the [[personal pronouns]] retain morphological case more strongly than any other [[word class]]. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=22}} English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as ''have'' and ''do'', expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by [[do-support]], [[wh-movement]] (fronting of question words beginning with ''wh''-) and word order [[Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with some verbs.<ref name=\"EGT\">{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Ronald |last2=McCarthey |first2=Michael |last3=Mark |first3=Geraldine |last4=O'Keeffe |first4=Anne |title=English Grammar Today |date=2016 |publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr |isbn=978-1316617397}}</ref>\n\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''speak/spoke'' and ''foot/feet'') and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''love/loved'', ''hand/hands'').<ref name=\"HOEL\">{{cite book |last1=Baugh |first1=Albert |last2=Cable |first2=Thomas |title=A history of the English language |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415655965 |edition=6th}}</ref> Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (''he/him, who/whom'') and in the inflection of the copula verb ''to be''.<ref name=\"HOEL\" />\n\nThe seven-word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:{{sfb|Aarts|Haegeman|2006|page=118}}\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| ''The'' || ''chairman'' || ''of'' || ''the'' || ''committee'' || ''and'' || ''the'' || ''loquacious'' || ''politician'' || ''clashed'' || ''violently'' || ''when'' || ''the'' || ''meeting'' || ''started''.\n|-\n| Det. || Noun || Prep. || Det. || Noun || Conj. || Det. || Adj. || Noun || Verb || Advb. || Conj. || Det. || Noun || Verb\n|}\n\n=== Nouns and noun phrases ===\n\nEnglish nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into [[proper nouns]] (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into [[count noun]]s and [[mass nouns]].{{sfn|Payne|Huddleston|2002}}\n\nMost count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural [[suffix]] -''s'', but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. ''one loaf of bread'', ''two loaves of bread''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=56\u201357}}\n\nRegular plural formation:\n: Singular: ''cat, dog''\n: Plural: ''cats, dogs''\n\nIrregular plural formation:\n: Singular: ''man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse''\n: Plural: ''men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice''\n\nPossession can be expressed either by the possessive [[enclitic]] -''s'' (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition ''of''. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the ''of'' possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -''s'' also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.<ref name=\"EGT\" />\n\nPossessive constructions:\n: With -s: ''The woman's husband's child''\n: With of: ''The child of the husband of the woman''\n\nNouns can form [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=55}} Noun phrases can be short, such as ''the man'', composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. ''red'', ''tall'', ''all'') and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. ''the'', ''that''). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as ''and'', or prepositions such as ''with'', e.g. ''the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles'' (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.<ref name=\"EGT\" /> For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in ''The President of India's wife'', where the enclitic follows ''India'' and not ''President''.\n\nThe class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of [[definiteness]], where ''the'' marks a definite noun and ''a'' or ''an'' an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include ''one'', ''many'', ''some'' and ''all'', are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. ''one man'' (sg.) but ''all men'' (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=54\u20135}}\n\n==== Adjectives ====\n\nAdjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=57}} In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases ''the slender boy'', and ''many slender girls'', the adjective ''slender'' does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.\n\nSome adjectives are inflected for [[comparison (grammar)|degree of comparison]], with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix ''-er'' marking the comparative, and ''-est'' marking the superlative: ''a small boy'', ''the boy is smaller than the girl'', ''that boy is the smallest''. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as ''good'', ''better'', and ''best''. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by [[periphrasis|periphrastic constructions]], with the adverb ''more'' marking the comparative, and ''most'' marking the superlative: ''happier'' or ''more happy'', ''the happiest'' or ''most happy''.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=540}} There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.{{sfn|Mair|2006|pages=148\u201349}}\n\n==== Pronouns, case, and person ====\n\nEnglish pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (''I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them'') as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing ''he/she/it''). The [[subjective case]] corresponds to the Old English [[nominative case]], and the [[objective case]] is used both in the sense of the previous [[accusative case]] (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or [[indirect object]] of a transitive verb).{{sfn|Leech|2006|page=69|quote=\"Nominative is a traditional name for the subjective case\"}}{{sfn|O'Dwyer|2006|quote=\"English has subjective, objective and possessive cases.\"}} Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise, the objective case is used.{{sfn|Greenbaum|Nelson|2002}} While grammarians such as [[Henry Sweet]]{{sfn|Sweet|2014|page=52|quote=But in that special class of nouns called personal pronouns we find a totally different system of case-inflection, namely, a '''nominative''' case (he) and an '''objective''' case (him)}} and [[Otto Jespersen]]{{sfn|Jespersen|2007|pp=173-185}} noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002}}, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.\n\nPossessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in ''my chair''), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. ''the chair is mine'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=425\u201326}} The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old 2nd person singular familiar pronoun ''[[thou]]'' acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned), and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as ''y'all'' found in [[Southern American English]] and [[African American Vernacular English|African American (Vernacular) English]] or ''youse'' found in [[Australian English]] and ''ye'' in [[Irish English]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ English personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Person\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Objective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Dependent possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Independent possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Reflexive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. sg.\n| ''I'' || ''me'' || ''my'' || ''mine'' || ''myself''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. sg.\n| ''you'' || ''you'' || ''your'' || ''yours'' || ''yourself''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. sg.\n| ''he/she/it'' || ''him/her/it'' || ''his/her/its'' || ''his/hers/its'' || ''himself/herself/itself''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. pl.\n| ''we'' || ''us'' || ''our'' || ''ours'' || ''ourselves''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. pl.\n| ''you'' || ''you'' || ''your'' || ''yours'' || ''yourselves''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. pl.\n| ''they'' || ''them'' || ''their'' || ''theirs'' || ''themselves''\n|}\n\nPronouns are used to refer to entities [[Deixis|deictically]] or [[Anaphoric reference|anaphorically]]. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation\u2014for example, the pronoun ''I'' identifies the speaker, and the pronoun ''you'', the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as ''that'' refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence ''I already told you that''. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. \"he sent it to himself\" or \"she braced herself for impact\").{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=426}}\n\n==== Prepositions ====\n\nPrepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. ''with the dog'', ''for my friend'', ''to school'', ''in England''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=58}} Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=58}} For example, in the phrase ''I gave it to him'', the preposition ''to'' marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb ''to give''. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\". But some contemporary grammars such as that of {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=598\u2013600}} no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.\n\n=== Verbs and verb phrases ===\n\nEnglish verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb ''to be'' is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=540}} Auxiliary verbs such as ''have'' and ''be'' are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form [[periphrasis|complex]] tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=541}}\n\nMost verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50}} The copula verb ''to be'' is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is ''am'', the third person singular form is ''is'', and the form ''are'' is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is ''been'' and its gerund-participle is ''being''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ English inflectional forms\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Inflection\n! scope=\"col\" | Strong\n! scope=\"col\" | Regular\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Plain present\n| ''take'' || ''love''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd person sg.<br />present\n| ''takes'' || ''loves''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Preterite\n| ''took'' || ''loved''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Plain (infinitive)\n| ''take'' || ''love''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gerund\u2013participle\n| ''taking'' || ''loving''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Past participle\n| ''taken'' || ''loved''\n|}\n\n==== Tense, aspect and mood ====\n\nEnglish has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ''-ed'', and for the strong verbs either the suffix ''-t'' or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix ''-s''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Present\n! scope=\"col\" | Preterite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First person\n| ''I run'' || ''I ran''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second person\n| ''You run'' || ''You ran''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third person\n| ''John runs'' || ''John ran''\n|}\n\nEnglish does not have a morphologised future tense.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=208\u2013210}} Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs ''will'' or ''shall''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51\u201352}} Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb ''be going to''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=210\u201311}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |Future\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First person\n| ''I will run''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second person\n| ''You will run''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third person\n| ''John will run''\n|}\n\nFurther aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily ''have'' and ''be'', which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (''I have run'' vs. ''I was running''), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (''I had been running'') and present perfect (''I have been running'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50\u201351}}\n\nFor the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as ''can'', ''may'', ''will'', ''shall'' and the past tense forms ''could'', ''might'', ''would'', ''should''. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular ''-s''), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: ''It is important that he run every day''; imperative ''Run!'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51\u201352}}\n\nAn infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition ''to'', is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.<ref name=\"meg\">{{cite web |title=Finite and Nonfinite Clauses |url=https://myenglishgrammar.com/lesson-17-clauses/6-finite-and-nonfinite-clauses.html |website=MyEnglishGrammar.com |accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> For example, ''he has to go'' where only the auxiliary verb ''have'' is inflected for time and the main verb ''to go'' is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as ''I saw him leave'', where the main verb is ''to see'' which is in a preterite form, and ''leave'' is in the infinitive.\n\n==== Phrasal verbs ====\n\nEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called [[phrasal verb]]s, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are ''to get up'', ''to ask out'', ''to back up'', ''to give up'', ''to get together'', ''to hang out'', ''to put up with'', etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly [[English-language idioms|idiomatic]] meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. ''lay off'' meaning ''terminate someone's employment'').{{sfn|Dixon|1982}} In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=274}}, do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. ''he woke up in the morning'' and ''he ran up in the mountains'' are syntactically equivalent.\n\n==== Adverbs ====\n\nThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.<ref name=\"EGT\" /> Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix ''-ly''. For example, in the phrase ''the woman walked quickly'', the adverb ''quickly'' is derived in this way from the adjective ''quick''. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as ''good'' which has the adverbial form ''well''.\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\n[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|right|thumb|In the English sentence ''The cat sat on the mat'', the subject is ''the cat'' (a noun phrase), the verb is ''sat'', and ''on the mat'' is a prepositional phrase (composed of a noun phrase ''the mat'' headed by the preposition ''on''). The tree describes the structure of the sentence.]]\n\nModern English syntax language is moderately [[Isolating language|analytic]].{{sfn|McArthur|1992|pp=64, 610\u2013611}} It has developed features such as [[English modal verb|modal verbs]] and [[word order]] as resources for conveying meaning. [[Auxiliary verb]]s mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the [[Grammatical voice|passive voice]] and progressive [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].\n\n==== Basic constituent order ====\n\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO).{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=553}} The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''.\n\nIn most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=550}} The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| ''The dog'' || ''bites'' || ''the man''\n|-\n| S || V || O\n|-\n| ''The man'' || ''bites'' || ''the dog''\n|-\n| S || V || O\n|}\n\nAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cases of Nouns and Pronouns |url=http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/cases.htm |website=Guide to Grammar and Writing |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| ''He'' || ''hit'' || ''him''\n|-\n| S || V || O\n|}\n\n[[Indirect object]]s (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as ''I gave <u>Jane</u> the book'' or in a prepositional phrase, such as ''I gave the book <u>to Jane</u>''.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=551}}\n\n==== Clause syntax ====\n{{Main|English clause syntax}}\n\nIn English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase ''I think (that) you are lying'', the main clause is headed by the verb ''think'', the subject is ''I'', but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause ''(that) you are lying''. The subordinating conjunction ''that'' shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=60\u201369}} [[Relative clause]]s are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence ''I saw the letter that you received today'', the relative clause ''that you received today'' specifies the meaning of the word ''letter'', the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns ''who'', ''whose'', ''whom'' and ''which'' as well as by ''that'' (which can also be omitted.){{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=545}} In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=557}}\n\n==== Auxiliary verb constructions ====\n{{Main|Do-support|Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion}}\n\nEnglish syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence ''the dog did not find its bone'', the clause ''find its bone'' is the complement of the negated verb ''did not''. [[Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion]] is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.\n\nThe verb ''do'' can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I ''did'' shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English [[syntax]] permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. [[Modern English]] does not allow the addition of the negating adverb ''not'' to an ordinary [[finite verb|finite]] lexical verb, as in ''*I know not''\u2014it can only be added to an auxiliary (or [[copular verb|copular]]) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary ''do'' is used, to produce a form like ''I do not (don't) know.'' The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions\u2014inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say ''*Know you him?''; grammatical rules require ''Do you know him?''{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=114}}\n\nNegation is done with the adverb ''not'', which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not ''-n't'' can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb ''to be''. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English ''I don't know him'' is the correct answer to the question ''Do you know him?'', but not ''*I know him not'', although this construction may be found in older English.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=786\u2013790}}\n\nPassive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb ''to be'' or ''to get'', although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with ''get''. For example, putting the sentence ''she sees him'' into the passive becomes ''he is seen (by her)'', or ''he gets seen (by her)''.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=26\u201327}}\n\n==== Questions ====\n\nBoth [[yes\u2013no question]]s and [[wh-question|''wh''-questions]] in English are mostly formed using [[subject\u2013auxiliary inversion]] (''Am I going tomorrow?'', ''Where can we eat?''), which may require [[do-support|''do''-support]] (''Do you like her?'', ''Where did he go?''). In most cases, [[interrogative word]]s (''wh''-words; e.g. ''what'', ''who'', ''where'', ''when'', ''why'', ''how'') appear in a [[Wh-movement|fronted position]]. For example, in the question ''What did you see?'', the word ''what'' appears as the first constituent despite being the [[grammatical object]] of the sentence. (When the ''wh''-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: ''Who saw the cat?''.) [[Prepositional phrases]] can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. ''To whose house did you go last night?''. The personal interrogative pronoun ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant ''whom'' serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=7-8}}\n\n==== Discourse level syntax ====\nWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a [[Topic and comment|topic-comment]] structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, ''the girl was stung by the bee''. Another way is through a [[cleft sentence]] where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a [[dummy subject]] such as ''it'' or ''there'', e.g. ''it was the girl that the bee stung'', ''there was a girl who was stung by a bee''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=1365\u201370}} Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., ''it is raining'') or in existential clauses (''there are many cars on the street''). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.\n\n[[Focus (linguistics)|Focus constructions]] emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, ''the girl was stung by <u>a bee</u>'' (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or ''<u>The girl</u> was stung by a bee'' (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1370}} Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, ''That girl over there, she was stung by a bee'', emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, ''she was stung by a bee, that girl over there'', where reference to the girl is established as an \"afterthought\".{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1366}}\n\n[[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] (e.g. ''that is exactly what I mean'' where ''that'' refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or ''then'' used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).{{sfn|Halliday|Hasan|1976}} [[Discourse marker]]s such as ''oh'', ''so'' or ''well'', also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for [[Stance (linguistics)|stance taking]] in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, ''no way is that true!'' (the idiomatic marker ''no way!'' expressing disbelief), or ''boy! I'm hungry'' (the marker ''boy'' expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.{{sfn|Schiffrin|1988}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n{{See also|Foreign language influences in English}}\nEnglish is a rich language in terms of vocabulary, containing more [[synonyms]] than any other language.{{sfn|Jambor|2007}} There are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which, in fact, have slightly different shades of meaning and must be chosen appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message intended. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if [[obsolete word]]s are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' from 1989.<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language \"How many words are there in the English language?\"], Oxford Dictionaries</ref> Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1&nbsp;million words\u2014but that count presumably includes words such as Latin [[species name]]s, [[scientific terminology]], [[botanical terms]], [[prefix]]ed and [[suffix]]ed words, [[jargon]], foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical [[acronym]]s.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}\n\nDue to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly, and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by [[Lexicography|lexicographers]], the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality [[Corpus linguistics|linguistic corpora]],{{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=24\u201350}} collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}\n\n=== Word formation processes ===\nEnglish forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}} producing compound words such as ''babysitter'' or ''ice cream'' or ''homesick''.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (''-hood'', ''-ness'', ''-ing'', ''-ility'') to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|Latin]] or [[English words of Greek origin|Greek origin]]).\n\nFormation of new words, called [[neologisms]], based on [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek and/or Latin roots]] (for example ''television'' or ''optometry'') is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the \"[[international scientific vocabulary]]\" (ISV) when compiling ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=120\u2013121}} words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. ''NATO'', ''laser'').\n\n=== Word origins ===\n{{Main|Lists of English loanwords by country or language of origin}}\n{{Pie chart\n|caption=Source languages of English vocabulary<ref name=\"Wolff\"/><ref>{{cite book|title = Joseph M.

This adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007|p=7}} The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.{{sfn|Nation|2001|p=265}} The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are mainly the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}\n\nBut one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of \"Latinate\" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}} Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.<ref name=\"dailymotion\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&#039;incroyable histoire des mots fran\u00e7ais dans la langue anglaise \u2013 Vid\u00e9o dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and [[northern England]]. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as ''egg'' and ''knife''.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007}}\n\nEnglish has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=4}} English continues to gain new loanwords and [[calques]] (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Fasold|Connor-Linton|2014|p=302}}\n\nEnglish has formal and informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|speech registers]]; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=124\u2013127}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n=== English loanwords and calques in other languages ===\nEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}}{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=692}} The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world ''lingua franca'', and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=197}} That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=198}} Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as [[calque]]s, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}} Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}}\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{See also|English alphabet|English braille|English orthography}}\n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a [[Latin alphabet]] (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.{{sfn|Gneuss|2013|p=23}} The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the [[Latin script]]: [[a]], [[b]], [[c]], [[d]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[o]], [[p]], [[q]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[v]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[z]] (which also have [[Letter case|capital]] forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nThe spelling system, or [[orthography]], of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} Further complications have arisen through [[sound change]]s with which the orthography has not kept pace.{{sfn|Lass|2000}} Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.{{sfn|Mountford|2006}} There are also systematic [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences between British and American English]]. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.{{sfn|Neijt|2006}}\n\nAlthough letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words ''photograph'', ''photography'', and ''photographic'',{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or the words ''electricity'' and ''electrical''. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}} The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|p=156}} Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nReaders of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] used to spell consonant sounds. The letters ''b'', ''d'', ''f'', ''h'', ''j'', ''k'', ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''p'', ''r'', ''s'', ''t'', ''v'', ''w'', ''y'', ''z'' represent, respectively, the phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, f, h, d\u0292, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/}}. The letters ''c'' and ''g'' normally represent {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, but there is also a [[soft c|soft ''c'']] pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}, and a [[Hard and soft G|soft ''g'']] pronounced {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters ''c'' and ''g'' are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ''ch'' for {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, ''sh'' for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, ''th'' for {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} or {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, ''ng'' for {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, ''qu'' for {{IPA|/kw/}}, and ''ph'' for {{IPA|/f/}} in Greek-derived words. The single letter ''x'' is generally pronounced as {{IPA|/z/}} in word-initial position and as {{IPA|/ks/}} otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=654}}\n\nFor the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''w'', ''y''). As a result, some \"[[Vowel length#Short and long vowels in English|long vowels]]\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the ''oa'' in ''boat'', the ''ow'' in ''how'', and the ''ay'' in ''stay''), or the historically based [[silent e|silent ''e'']] (as in ''note'' and ''cake'').{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}}\n\nThe consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.{{sfn|Dehaene|2009}} Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.{{sfn|McGuinness|1997}}{{sfn|Shaywitz|2003}} Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=159}}\n\nEnglish writing also includes a system of [[punctuation]] marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.{{sfn|Lawler|2006|p=290}}\n\n== Dialects, accents, and varieties ==\n{{Main|List of dialects of the English language|World Englishes|regional accents of English}}\n\nDialectologists identify many [[List of dialects of the English language|English dialects]], which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate [[Regional accents of English|regional accents]]. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of [[British English]] (BrE) and [[North American English]] (NAE).{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=107}} There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]].\n\n=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===\n{{See also|English language in England|Northern England English|Scots language|Scottish English|Welsh English|Estuary English|Ulster English|Hiberno-English}}\n\n[[File:Dialects of English in UK and Ireland.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the main dialect regions in the UK and Ireland]]\n\nAs the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), an educated dialect of [[South East England]], is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the [[Survey of English Dialects]], grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|p=125}}\n\nNonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact, only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=3}} There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=37}} Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered \"non-standard\" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is [[H-dropping]], which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England\u2014yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=40}}\n\n{{listen|filename=Russell brand bbc radio4 desert island discs 21 07 2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of an [[Essex]] male with a working-class [[Estuary English|Estuary accent]] of the region around London ([[Russell Brand]]).}}\n{{listen|filename=Recording of speaker of British English (Received Pronunciation).ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of an English female with a [[Received Pronunciation]] or \"[[standard English|Standard]] British\" accent.}}\n{{listen|filename=RenfrewshireAccent.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a [[Renfrewshire]] male with a [[Scottish accent]].}}\n{{listen|filename=Mary Robinson - Desert Island Discs - 28 July 2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of a woman with a supraregional [[Irish accent]] ([[Mary Robinson]]).}}\n\n[[English language in England|English in England]] can be divided into four major dialect regions, [[West Country dialects|Southwest English]], South East English, Midlands English, and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects and the [[Geordie]] dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in [[Liverpool]] ([[Scouse]]) and [[Manchester]] ([[Manchester dialect|Mancunian]]). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|p=31}}\n\nSince the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the [[Cockney]] dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ee-faqs-jcw.htm |title=Estuary English Q and A - JCW |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|p=80}} Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of [[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]] (''drawing'' is pronounced ''drawring'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dr\u0254\u02d0r\u026a\u014b/}}), [[t-glottalization|''t''-glottalisation]] (''Potter'' is pronounced with a glottal stop as ''Po'er'' {{IPA|/po\u0294\u028c/}}), and the pronunciation of ''th-'' as {{IPA|/f/}} (''thanks'' pronounced ''fanks'') or {{IPA|/v/}} (''bother'' pronounced ''bover'').{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|pages=80\u201381}}\n\n[[Scots language|Scots]] is today considered a separate language from English, but it has [[History of the Scots language|its origins]] in early Northern Middle English{{sfn|Aitken|McArthur|1979|page=81}} and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]] and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, [[Scottish English]] comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.{{sfn|Romaine|1982}}\n\nIn [[Ireland]], various forms of English have been spoken since the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasions]] of the 11th century. In [[County Wexford]], in the area surrounding [[Dublin]], two extinct dialects known as [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy]] and [[Fingallian]] developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into [[Ulster English]], the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]] which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86\u201387}}{{sfn|Hickey|2007}}\n\n=== North America ===\n{{Main|American English|General American|African American Vernacular English|Southern American English|Canadian English}}\n{{listen|filename=Emery Emery Voice.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern U.S.]] male with a [[general American]] accent ([[Emery Emery]]).}}\n{{listen|filename=George W.

Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in ''the government is'' rather than ''are'').{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=16\u201321}}{{sfn|Burridge|2010}} New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=24\u201326}}{{sfn|Maclagan|2010}}{{sfn|Gordon|Campbell|Hay et al.|2004}}\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\n{{Main|Philippine English|Singapore English}}\nThe first significant exposure of the [[Philippines]] to the English language occurred in 1762 when the [[British occupation of Manila|British occupied Manila]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence.

Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, from street signs and marquees, government documents and forms, courtrooms, the media and entertainment industries, the business sector, and other aspects of daily life. One such usage that is also prominent in the country is in speech, where most [[Filipinos]] from [[Manila]] would use or have been exposed to [[Taglish]], a form of code-switching between [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and English.

There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.{{sfn|Lanham|1982}} Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.{{sfn|Lass|2002}} Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k/ without aspiration (e.g. ''pin'' pronounced {{IPA|[p\u026an]}} rather than as {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}} as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap {{IPA|[\u027e]}} instead of as the more common fricative.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=30\u201331}}\n\n{{listen|filename=Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie_bbc_radio4_front_row_03_05_2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of a woman with an educated [[Nigerian English|Nigerian accent]] ([[Chimamanda Adichie]])}}\nNigerian English is a [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect of English]] spoken in [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861683342/Nigerian_English.html|title=Nigerian English|work=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909162439/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861683342/Nigerian_English.html|archivedate=9 September 2010}}</ref> It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. ''senior wife''). Over 150&nbsp;million Nigerians speak English.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adegbija |first1=Efurosibina |title=Lexico-semantic variation in Nigerian English |journal=World Englishes |date=1989 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013177 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.1989.tb00652.x}}</ref>\n\nSeveral varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the [[Leeward Islands|Leeward]] and [[Windward Islands]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and [[Belize]]. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican English Creole|Jamaican Creole]]. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.{{sfn|Lawton|1982}} Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and [[code-switching]] between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as \"basilect\" and the more RP-like forms serving as the \"acrolect\", the most formal register.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|page=115}}\n\nMost Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}} are monophthongs {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} or even the reverse diphthongs {{IPA|[ie]}} and {{IPA|[uo]}} (e.g. ''bay'' and ''boat'' pronounced {{IPA|[b\u02b2e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[b\u02b7o\u02d0t]}}). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283ail]}} and \"wind\" {{IPA|[win]}}.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=117\u201318}}{{sfn|Lawton|1982|page=256\u201360}}{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=115\u201316}}\n\n{{listen|filename=Vandana Shiva BBC Radio4 Saving Species 23 Dec 2011 b010x8sq.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of a [[North India]]n woman with an [[Indian English|Indian accent]] ([[Vandana Shiva]])}}\nAs a historical legacy, [[Indian English]] tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as {{IPA|[\u0288]}} and {{IPA|[\u0256]}}) and the replacement of {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} with dentals {{IPA|[t\u032a]}} and {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent {{angbr|h}} found in words such as ''ghost'' is pronounced as an Indian [[Breathy voice|voiced aspirated]] stop {{IPA|[\u0261\u02b1]}}.{{sfn|Sailaja|2009|pages=19\u201324}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n<!-- The entries in the bibliography are in alphabetical order.

The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the [[Anglo-Frisian languages]], are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the [[Ingvaeonic|Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages]], though this grouping remains debated.{{sfn|Bammesberger|1992|p=30}} Old English evolved into [[Middle English]], which in turn evolved into Modern English.{{sfn|Robinson|1992}} Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including [[Scots language|Scots]]{{sfn|Romaine|1982|pp=56\u201365}} and the extinct [[Fingallian]] and [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy (Yola)]] dialects of Ireland.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86\u201387}}\n\nLike [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], the development of English in the [[British Isles]] isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences.

These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic [[clades]]\u2014but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a [[mixed language]] or a [[Creole language|creole]]\u2014a theory called the [[Middle English creole hypothesis]]. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=264\u2013265}}{{sfn|Watts|2011|loc=Chapter 4}}\n\nEnglish is classified as a Germanic language because it shares [[language change|innovations]] with other Germanic languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].{{sfn|Durrell|2006}} These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called [[Proto-Germanic]].

English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see {{section link|Phonological history of Old English|Palatalization}}).{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|van der Auwera|1994}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of English}}\n\n=== Proto-Germanic to Old English ===\n{{Main|Old English}}\n\n[[File:Beowulf Cotton MS Vitellius A XV f. 132r.jpg|thumb|The opening to the Old English epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[manuscript|handwritten]] in [[Half-uncial|half-uncial script]]:<br />{{lang|ang|H\u01bf\u00e6t \u01bf\u0113 G\u0101rde/na ing\u0113ar dagum \u00fe\u0113od cyninga / \u00ferym ge frunon...}}<br />\"Listen!

Old English developed from a set of [[Ingvaeonic languages|North Sea Germanic dialects]] originally spoken along the coasts of [[Frisia]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Jutland]], and Southern [[Sweden]] by Germanic tribes known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]]. From the 5th century CE, the Anglo-Saxons [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|settled Britain]] as [[End of Roman rule in Britain|the Roman economy and administration collapsed]]. By the 7th century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons [[Celtic language-death in England|became dominant in Britain]], replacing the languages of [[Roman Britain]] (43\u2013409 CE): [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by the [[Roman occupation of Britain|Roman occupation]].{{sfn|Collingwood|Myres|1936}}{{sfn|Graddol|Leith|Swann et al.|2007}}{{sfn|Blench|Spriggs|1999}} ''England'' and ''English'' (originally {{lang|ang|\u00c6nglaland}} and {{lang|ang|\u00c6nglisc}}) are named after the Angles.{{sfn|Bosworth|Toller|1921}}\n\nOld English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects ([[Mercian dialect|Mercian]] and [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]]) and the Saxon dialects, [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]].{{sfn|Campbell|1959|p=4}} Through the educational reforms of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of [[Wessex]], the West Saxon dialect became the [[standard language|standard written variety]].{{sfn|Toon|1992|loc=Chapter: Old English Dialects}} The [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, ''[[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]]'', is written in Northumbrian.{{sfn|Donoghue|2008}} Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the [[Scots language]] developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic script]].{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}} By the 6th century, a [[Old English Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]] was adopted, written with [[half-uncial]] [[letterform]]s. It included the runic letters ''[[wynn]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}} and ''[[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00fe}}}}, and the modified Latin letters ''[[eth]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00f0}}}}, and ''[[\u00c6|ash]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00e6}}}}.{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}}{{sfn|Denison|Hogg|2006|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nOld English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern [[German language|German]], and its closest relative is [[Old Frisian]]. [[Old English grammar|Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs]] had many more [[Inflectional morphology|inflectional endings and forms]], and word order was [[Pragmatic word order|much freer]] than in Modern English. Modern English has [[grammatical case|case forms]] in pronouns (''he'', ''him'', ''his'') and has a few verb inflections (''speak'', ''speaks'', ''speaking'', ''spoke'', ''spoken''), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] endings.{{sfn|Hogg|1992|loc=Chapter 3.

Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating gnashing.\n|source= [[John of Trevisa]], ca. 1385{{sfn|Hogg|2006|pp=360\u2013361}}\n}}\n\nFrom the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through [[language contact]] into [[Middle English]]. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200\u20131450.\n\nFirst, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with [[Old Norse]], a [[North Germanic]] language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the [[Danelaw]] area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in [[the Midlands]] around [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]], and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in direct contact with Norse speakers. An element of Norse influence that persists in all English varieties today is the group of pronouns beginning with ''th-'' (''they, them, their'') which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with {{lang|ang|h-}} ({{lang|ang|hie, him, hera}}).{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=284\u2013290}}\n\nWith the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with the [[Old Norman]] language, a [[Romance language]] closely related to Modern [[French language|French]]. The Norman language in England eventually developed into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of [[loanwords]] related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=39}} Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,{{sfn|Lass|1992}} and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.{{sfn|Fischer|van der Wurff|2006|pages=111\u201313}} In the [[Wycliffe Bible]] of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written:\n\n: {{lang|enm|Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis}}<ref>{{cite web| last = Wycliffe | first = John | url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wycliffe/wycbible-all.pdf | publisher = Wesley NNU | title = Bible}}</ref>\n\nHere the plural suffix {{lang|enm|-n}} on the verb ''have'' is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and [[Thomas Malory|Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horobin |first1=Simon |title=Chaucer's Middle English |url=https://opencanterburytales.dsl.lsu.edu/refmideng/ |website=The Open Access Companion to the Canterbury Tales |publisher=Louisiana State University |accessdate=24 November 2019 |quote=The only appearances of their and them in Chaucer\u2019s works are in the Reeve\u2019s Tale, where they form part of the Northern dialect spoken by the two Cambridge students, Aleyn and John, demonstrating that at this time they were still perceived to be Northernisms}}</ref>\n\n=== Early Modern English ===\n{{Main|Early Modern English}}\n\n[[File:Great Vowel Shift2a.svg|right|upright=1.36|thumb|Graphic representation of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level]]\n\nThe next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500\u20131700). Early Modern English was characterised by the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (1350\u20131700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a [[chain shift]], meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. [[Mid vowel|Mid]] and [[open vowel]]s were [[raising (phonology)|raised]], and [[close vowel]]s were [[vowel breaking|broken]] into [[diphthong]]s. For example, the word ''bite'' was originally pronounced as the word ''beet'' is today, and the second vowel in the word ''about'' was pronounced as the word ''boot'' is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.{{sfn|Lass|2000}}{{sfn|G\u00f6rlach|1991|pp=66\u201370}}\n\nEnglish began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Around 1430, the [[Court of Chancery]] in [[Westminster]] began using English in its [[writ|official documents]], and a new standard form of Middle English, known as [[Chancery Standard]], developed from the dialects of London and the [[East Midlands English|East Midlands]]. In 1476, [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.{{sfn|Nevalainen|Tieken-Boon van Ostade|2006|pages=274\u201379}} Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and the [[King James Version|translation of the Bible]] commissioned by [[James VI and I|King James I]]. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn \u0261n sw/}} in ''knight'', ''gnat'', and ''sword'' were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.{{sfn|Cercignani|1981}}\n\nIn the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:\n: ''The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests''{{sfn|Lass|2006|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nThis exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of ''of'' instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (''ayre'') and word replacements (''bird'' originally meaning \"nestling\" had replaced OE ''fugol'').{{sfn|Lass|2006|pp=46-47}}\n\n=== Spread of Modern English ===\n\nBy the late 18th century, the [[British Empire]] had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.{{sfn|How English evolved into a global language|2010}}{{sfn|The Routes of English}} England continued to form new colonies, and these later developed their own norms for speech and writing. English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent nations that had multiple [[indigenous language]]s opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.{{sfn|Romaine|2006|p=586}}{{sfn|Mufwene|2006|p=614}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013|pp=81\u201386}} In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a [[superpower]] following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the [[BBC]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Colin|title=''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education'', page CCCXI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC|date=August 1998|page=311|publisher=Multilingual Matters Ltd|accessdate=9 August 2015|isbn=978-1-85359-362-8}}</ref> and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.{{sfn|McCrum|MacNeil|Cran|2003|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAs Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 [[Samuel Johnson]] published his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, [[Noah Webster]] published the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English language]]'' to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1\u201356}}\n\nIn modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as ''he'' and ''him'', ''she'' and ''her'', ''who'' and ''whom''), and SVO word-order is mostly fixed.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1\u201356}} Some changes, such as the use of [[do-support]] have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word \"do\" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=2|quote=Other changes such as the spread and regularisation of do support began in the thirteenth century and were more or less complete in the nineteenth. Although do coexisted with the simple verb forms in negative statements from the early ninth century, obligatoriness was not complete until the nineteenth. The increasing use of do periphrasis coincides with the fixing of SVO word order. Not surprisingly, do is first widely used in interrogatives, where the word order is disrupted, and then later spread to negatives.}} Now, do-support with the verb ''have'' is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in ''-ing'', appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as ''had been being built'' are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. ''dreamed'' instead of ''dreamt''), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. ''more polite'' instead of ''politer''). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power.{{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=18\u201319}}{{sfn|Mair|Leech|2006}}{{sfn|Mair|2006}}\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\n{{anchor|Geographic distribution}}\n{{See also|List of territorial entities where English is an official language|Geographical distribution of English speakers|List of countries by English-speaking population|English-speaking world}}\n[[File:Map of English native speakers.png|upright=1.16|thumb|Percentage of English native speakers]]\n[[File:Percentage of English speakers by country as of 2014.png|upright=1.16|thumb|Percentage of English speakers by country\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; background:none;\"\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|\n{{legend|#225500|80\u2013100%}}\n{{legend|#44aa00|60\u201380%}}\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|\n{{legend|#66ff00|40\u201360%}}\n{{legend|#99ff55|20\u201340%}}\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|\n{{legend|#ccffaa|0\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#b9b9b9|Not available}}\n|}]]\n\n{{as of|2016}}, 400&nbsp;million people spoke English as their [[first language]], and 1.1&nbsp;billion spoke it as a secondary language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Which countries are best at English as a second language?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/which-countries-are-best-at-english-as-a-second-language-4d24c8c8-6cf6-4067-a753-4c82b4bc865b|website=World Economic Forum|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref> English is the [[List of languages by total number of speakers|largest language by number of speakers]].

The \"inner circle\"{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when [[lingua franca|people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world]].\n\n=== Three circles of English-speaking countries ===\n[[Braj Kachru]] distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a [[Three Circles of English|three circles model]].{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} In his model,\n* the \"inner circle\" countries have large communities of native speakers of English,\n* \"outer circle\" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and \n* \"expanding circle\" countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language.\n\nKachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=196}}\n\n[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.svg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's ''Three Circles of English'']]\nCountries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English.

They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}}\n\nIn the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the \"expanding circle\".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=4}} The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=5}} For example, in the [[Netherlands]] and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,{{sfn|European Commission|2012}} and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the \"outer circle\" and \"expanding circle\". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=197}}\n\nMany users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=198}} Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.{{sfn|Bao|2006}} Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=7}}\n\n=== Pluricentric English ===\n{{Pie chart\n|caption=Pie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in \"inner circle\" English-speaking countries.

In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus ''nip'' has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than ''nib'' {{IPA|[n\u026a\u02d1b\u0325]}} ([[#Vowels|see below]]).{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pages=47\u201353}} \n* lenis stops: ''bin'' {{IPA|[b\u0325\u026a\u02d1n]}}, ''about'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8ba\u028at]}}, ''nib'' {{IPA|[n\u026a\u02d1b\u0325]}}\n* fortis stops: ''pin'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}}; ''spin'' {{IPA|[sp\u026an]}}; ''happy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u00e6pi]}}; ''nip'' {{IPA|[n\u026ap\u031a]}} or {{IPA|[n\u026a\u0294p]}}\n\nIn RP, the lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}}, has two main [[allophone]]s (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain {{IPA|[l]}}, as in ''light'', and the dark or [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarised]] {{IPA|[\u026b]}}, as in ''full''.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=13}} GA has dark ''l'' in most cases.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=41}}\n* clear ''l'': RP ''light'' {{IPA|[la\u026at]}}\n* dark ''l'': RP and GA ''full'' {{IPA|[f\u028a\u026b]}}, GA ''light'' {{IPA|[\u026ba\u026at]}}\n\nAll [[sonorant]]s (liquids {{IPA|/l, r/}} and nasals {{IPA|/m, n, \u014b/}}) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|pages=56\u201359}}\n* voiceless sonorants: ''clay'' {{IPA|[kl\u0325e\u026a\u032f]}}; ''snow'' RP {{IPA|[sn\u0325\u0259\u028a\u032f]}}, GA {{IPA|[sn\u0325o\u028a\u032f]}}\n* syllabic sonorants: ''paddle'' {{IPA|[\u02c8pad.l\u0329]}}, ''button'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028ct.n\u0329]}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n{{Main|English phonology#Vowels}}\n\nThe pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent.

In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.\n\nIn both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically [[clipping (phonetics)|shortened before fortis consonants]] in the same [[syllable]], like {{IPA|/t t\u0283 f/}}, but not before lenis consonants like {{IPA|/d d\u0292 v/}} or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of ''rich'' {{IPA|[r\u026at\u0283]}}, ''neat'' {{IPA|[nit]}}, and ''safe'' {{IPA|[se\u026a\u032ff]}} are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ''ridge'' {{IPA|[r\u026a\u02d1d\u0292]}}, ''need'' {{IPA|[ni\u02d1d]}}, and ''save'' {{IPA|[se\u02d1\u026a\u032fv]}}, and the vowel of ''light'' {{IPA|[la\u026a\u032ft]}} is shorter than that of ''lie'' {{IPA|[la\u02d1\u026a\u032f]}}. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=46\u201350}}\n\nThe vowel {{IPA|/\u0259/}} only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.{{sfn|Cruttenden|2014|p=138}}{{sfn|Flemming|Johnson|2007}} Some dialects do not contrast {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}} in unstressed positions, so that ''rabbit'' and ''abbot'' rhyme and ''Lenin'' and ''Lennon'' are homophonous, a dialect feature called [[weak vowel merger]].{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=167}} GA {{IPA|/\u025cr/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} are realised as an [[r-colored vowel|''r''-coloured vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025a]}}, as in ''further'' {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u025a\u00f0\u025a]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u025cr\u00f0\u0259r/}}), which in RP is realised as {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u0259\u02d0\u00f0\u0259]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u025c\u02d0\u00f0\u0259/}}).{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=121}}\n\n=== Phonotactics ===\nAn English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in ''sprint'' {{IPA|/spr\u026ant/}}, and end with up to four, as in ''texts'' {{IPA|/teksts/}}. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word ''strengths'' {{IPA|/str\u025b\u014bk\u03b8s/}} is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in ''play''; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in ''fly'' or ''sly''; ''s'' and a voiceless stop, as in ''stay''; and ''s'', a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in ''string''.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=60}} Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: {{IPA|/h/}} can only occur in syllable-initial position, and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} only in syllable-final position.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|pages=537\u2013538}}\n\n=== Stress, rhythm and intonation ===\n{{See also|Stress and vowel reduction in English|Intonation in English}}\n\n[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] plays an important role in English. Certain [[syllable]]s are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently [[vowel reduction|reduced]] while vowels in stressed syllables are not.{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|1999|page=42}} Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as ''can'', have [[weak and strong forms in English|weak and strong forms]] depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.\n\nStress in English is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word ''contract'' is stressed on the first syllable ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u0252|n|t|r|\u00e6|k|t}} {{respell|KON|trakt}}) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable ({{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|n|\u02c8|t|r|\u00e6|k|t}} {{respell|k\u0259n|TRAKT|'}}) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb.{{sfn|Oxford Learner's Dictionary|2015|loc=Entry \"contract\"}}{{sfn|Merriam Webster|2015|loc=Entry \"contract\"}}{{sfn|Macquarie Dictionary|2015|loc=Entry \"contract\"}} Here stress is connected to [[vowel reduction]]: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel {{IPA|/\u0252/}}, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to {{IPA|/\u0259/}}. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. ''a burnout'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u025c\u02d0r|n|a\u028a|t}}) versus ''to burn out'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u025c\u02d0r|n|_|\u02c8|a\u028a|t}}), and ''a hotdog'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0252|t|d|\u0252|g}}) versus ''a hot dog'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0252|t|_|\u02c8|d|\u0252|g}}).{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=66}}\n\nIn terms of [[rhythm]], English is generally described as a [[stress-timed]] language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sentence stress |url=https://esol.britishcouncil.org/content/teachers/staff-room/teaching-articles/sentence-stress |website=ESOL Nexus |publisher=British Council |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened.

The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[Hiberno English|Ireland]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] and [[South African English|South Africa]] have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table \"Varieties of Standard English and their features\".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nEnglish has undergone many [[Phonological history of English|historical sound changes]], some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] and [[Canadian Shift]] have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |date=2000  |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Lass |title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume II |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=90,118,610 |isbn=0521264758}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=Roger |date=2000  |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Lass |title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=80,656 |isbn=0521264766}}</ref>\n\nSome dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a [[voicelessness|voiceless]] {{IPAblink|\u028d}} sound in ''whine'' that contrasts with the voiced {{IPA|[w]}} in ''wine'', but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced {{IPA|[w]}}, a dialect feature called [[wine\u2013whine merger|''wine''\u2013''whine'' merger]]. The unvoiced velar fricative sound {{IPA|/x/}} is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes ''loch'' {{IPA|/l\u0254x/}} from ''lock'' {{IPA|/l\u0254k/}}. Accents like [[Cockney]] with \"''h''-dropping\" lack the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}}, and dialects with [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]] and [[th-fronting|''th''-fronting]] like [[African American Vernacular English|African American Vernacular]] and [[Estuary English]] do not have the dental fricatives {{IPA|/\u03b8, \u00f0/}}, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops {{IPA|/t, d/}} or labiodental fricatives {{IPA|/f, v/}}.{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Giegerich|1992|page=36}} Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as [[Yod-dropping|''yod''-dropping]], [[yod-coalescence|''yod''-coalescence]], and reduction of consonant clusters.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=Accents of English |date=1982 |isbn=0521285402}}</ref>\n\n[[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] vary in their pronunciation of historical {{IPA|/r/}} after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the [[syllable coda]]). GA is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic dialect]], meaning that it pronounces {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses {{IPA|/r/}} in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide {{IPA|/r/}} like RP or keep it like GA.{{sfn|Lass|2000|p=114}}\n\nThere is complex dialectal variation in words with the [[Phonological history of English short A|open front]] and [[Phonological history of English low back vowels|open back vowels]] {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u0251\u02d0 \u0252 \u0254\u02d0/}}. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u0251 \u0254/}},{{sfn|Wells|1982|pages=xviii\u2013xix}} and in Canadian English, they merge to two {{IPA|/\u00e6 \u0251/}}.{{sfn|Wells|1982|page=493}} In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table \"Dialects and open vowels\" shows this variation with [[lexical set]]s in which these sounds occur.\n\n== Grammar ==\nAs is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional [[case system]] in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. Only the [[personal pronouns]] retain morphological case more strongly than any other [[word class]]. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=22}} English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as ''have'' and ''do'', expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by [[do-support]], [[wh-movement]] (fronting of question words beginning with ''wh''-) and word order [[Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with some verbs.<ref name=\"EGT\">{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Ronald |last2=McCarthey |first2=Michael |last3=Mark |first3=Geraldine |last4=O'Keeffe |first4=Anne |title=English Grammar Today |date=2016 |publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr |isbn=978-1316617397}}</ref>\n\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''speak/spoke'' and ''foot/feet'') and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''love/loved'', ''hand/hands'').<ref name=\"HOEL\">{{cite book |last1=Baugh |first1=Albert |last2=Cable |first2=Thomas |title=A history of the English language |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415655965 |edition=6th}}</ref> Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (''he/him, who/whom'') and in the inflection of the copula verb ''to be''.<ref name=\"HOEL\" />\n\nThe seven-word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:{{sfb|Aarts|Haegeman|2006|page=118}}\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| ''The'' || ''chairman'' || ''of'' || ''the'' || ''committee'' || ''and'' || ''the'' || ''loquacious'' || ''politician'' || ''clashed'' || ''violently'' || ''when'' || ''the'' || ''meeting'' || ''started''.\n|-\n| Det. || Noun || Prep. || Det. || Noun || Conj. || Det. || Adj. || Noun || Verb || Advb. || Conj. || Det. || Noun || Verb\n|}\n\n=== Nouns and noun phrases ===\n\nEnglish nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into [[proper nouns]] (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into [[count noun]]s and [[mass nouns]].{{sfn|Payne|Huddleston|2002}}\n\nMost count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural [[suffix]] -''s'', but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. ''one loaf of bread'', ''two loaves of bread''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=56\u201357}}\n\nRegular plural formation:\n: Singular: ''cat, dog''\n: Plural: ''cats, dogs''\n\nIrregular plural formation:\n: Singular: ''man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse''\n: Plural: ''men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice''\n\nPossession can be expressed either by the possessive [[enclitic]] -''s'' (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition ''of''. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the ''of'' possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -''s'' also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.<ref name=\"EGT\" />\n\nPossessive constructions:\n: With -s: ''The woman's husband's child''\n: With of: ''The child of the husband of the woman''\n\nNouns can form [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=55}} Noun phrases can be short, such as ''the man'', composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. ''red'', ''tall'', ''all'') and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. ''the'', ''that''). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as ''and'', or prepositions such as ''with'', e.g. ''the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles'' (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.<ref name=\"EGT\" /> For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in ''The President of India's wife'', where the enclitic follows ''India'' and not ''President''.\n\nThe class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of [[definiteness]], where ''the'' marks a definite noun and ''a'' or ''an'' an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include ''one'', ''many'', ''some'' and ''all'', are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. ''one man'' (sg.) but ''all men'' (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=54\u20135}}\n\n==== Adjectives ====\n\nAdjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=57}} In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases ''the slender boy'', and ''many slender girls'', the adjective ''slender'' does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.\n\nSome adjectives are inflected for [[comparison (grammar)|degree of comparison]], with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix ''-er'' marking the comparative, and ''-est'' marking the superlative: ''a small boy'', ''the boy is smaller than the girl'', ''that boy is the smallest''. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as ''good'', ''better'', and ''best''. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by [[periphrasis|periphrastic constructions]], with the adverb ''more'' marking the comparative, and ''most'' marking the superlative: ''happier'' or ''more happy'', ''the happiest'' or ''most happy''.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=540}} There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.{{sfn|Mair|2006|pages=148\u201349}}\n\n==== Pronouns, case, and person ====\n\nEnglish pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (''I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them'') as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing ''he/she/it''). The [[subjective case]] corresponds to the Old English [[nominative case]], and the [[objective case]] is used both in the sense of the previous [[accusative case]] (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or [[indirect object]] of a transitive verb).{{sfn|Leech|2006|page=69|quote=\"Nominative is a traditional name for the subjective case\"}}{{sfn|O'Dwyer|2006|quote=\"English has subjective, objective and possessive cases.\"}} Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise, the objective case is used.{{sfn|Greenbaum|Nelson|2002}} While grammarians such as [[Henry Sweet]]{{sfn|Sweet|2014|page=52|quote=But in that special class of nouns called personal pronouns we find a totally different system of case-inflection, namely, a '''nominative''' case (he) and an '''objective''' case (him)}} and [[Otto Jespersen]]{{sfn|Jespersen|2007|pp=173-185}} noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002}}, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.\n\nPossessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in ''my chair''), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. ''the chair is mine'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=425\u201326}} The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old 2nd person singular familiar pronoun ''[[thou]]'' acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned), and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as ''y'all'' found in [[Southern American English]] and [[African American Vernacular English|African American (Vernacular) English]] or ''youse'' found in [[Australian English]] and ''ye'' in [[Irish English]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ English personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Person\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Objective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Dependent possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Independent possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Reflexive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. sg.\n| ''I'' || ''me'' || ''my'' || ''mine'' || ''myself''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. sg.\n| ''you'' || ''you'' || ''your'' || ''yours'' || ''yourself''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. sg.\n| ''he/she/it'' || ''him/her/it'' || ''his/her/its'' || ''his/hers/its'' || ''himself/herself/itself''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. pl.\n| ''we'' || ''us'' || ''our'' || ''ours'' || ''ourselves''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. pl.\n| ''you'' || ''you'' || ''your'' || ''yours'' || ''yourselves''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. pl.\n| ''they'' || ''them'' || ''their'' || ''theirs'' || ''themselves''\n|}\n\nPronouns are used to refer to entities [[Deixis|deictically]] or [[Anaphoric reference|anaphorically]]. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation\u2014for example, the pronoun ''I'' identifies the speaker, and the pronoun ''you'', the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as ''that'' refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence ''I already told you that''. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. \"he sent it to himself\" or \"she braced herself for impact\").{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=426}}\n\n==== Prepositions ====\n\nPrepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. ''with the dog'', ''for my friend'', ''to school'', ''in England''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=58}} Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=58}} For example, in the phrase ''I gave it to him'', the preposition ''to'' marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb ''to give''. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\". But some contemporary grammars such as that of {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=598\u2013600}} no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.\n\n=== Verbs and verb phrases ===\n\nEnglish verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb ''to be'' is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=540}} Auxiliary verbs such as ''have'' and ''be'' are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form [[periphrasis|complex]] tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=541}}\n\nMost verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50}} The copula verb ''to be'' is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is ''am'', the third person singular form is ''is'', and the form ''are'' is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is ''been'' and its gerund-participle is ''being''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ English inflectional forms\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Inflection\n! scope=\"col\" | Strong\n! scope=\"col\" | Regular\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Plain present\n| ''take'' || ''love''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd person sg.<br />present\n| ''takes'' || ''loves''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Preterite\n| ''took'' || ''loved''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Plain (infinitive)\n| ''take'' || ''love''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gerund\u2013participle\n| ''taking'' || ''loving''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Past participle\n| ''taken'' || ''loved''\n|}\n\n==== Tense, aspect and mood ====\n\nEnglish has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ''-ed'', and for the strong verbs either the suffix ''-t'' or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix ''-s''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Present\n! scope=\"col\" | Preterite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First person\n| ''I run'' || ''I ran''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second person\n| ''You run'' || ''You ran''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third person\n| ''John runs'' || ''John ran''\n|}\n\nEnglish does not have a morphologised future tense.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=208\u2013210}} Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs ''will'' or ''shall''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51\u201352}} Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb ''be going to''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=210\u201311}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |Future\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First person\n| ''I will run''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second person\n| ''You will run''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third person\n| ''John will run''\n|}\n\nFurther aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily ''have'' and ''be'', which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (''I have run'' vs. ''I was running''), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (''I had been running'') and present perfect (''I have been running'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50\u201351}}\n\nFor the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as ''can'', ''may'', ''will'', ''shall'' and the past tense forms ''could'', ''might'', ''would'', ''should''. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular ''-s''), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: ''It is important that he run every day''; imperative ''Run!'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51\u201352}}\n\nAn infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition ''to'', is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.<ref name=\"meg\">{{cite web |title=Finite and Nonfinite Clauses |url=https://myenglishgrammar.com/lesson-17-clauses/6-finite-and-nonfinite-clauses.html |website=MyEnglishGrammar.com |accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> For example, ''he has to go'' where only the auxiliary verb ''have'' is inflected for time and the main verb ''to go'' is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as ''I saw him leave'', where the main verb is ''to see'' which is in a preterite form, and ''leave'' is in the infinitive.\n\n==== Phrasal verbs ====\n\nEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called [[phrasal verb]]s, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are ''to get up'', ''to ask out'', ''to back up'', ''to give up'', ''to get together'', ''to hang out'', ''to put up with'', etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly [[English-language idioms|idiomatic]] meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. ''lay off'' meaning ''terminate someone's employment'').{{sfn|Dixon|1982}} In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=274}}, do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. ''he woke up in the morning'' and ''he ran up in the mountains'' are syntactically equivalent.\n\n==== Adverbs ====\n\nThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.<ref name=\"EGT\" /> Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix ''-ly''. For example, in the phrase ''the woman walked quickly'', the adverb ''quickly'' is derived in this way from the adjective ''quick''. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as ''good'' which has the adverbial form ''well''.\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\n[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|right|thumb|In the English sentence ''The cat sat on the mat'', the subject is ''the cat'' (a noun phrase), the verb is ''sat'', and ''on the mat'' is a prepositional phrase (composed of a noun phrase ''the mat'' headed by the preposition ''on''). The tree describes the structure of the sentence.]]\n\nModern English syntax language is moderately [[Isolating language|analytic]].{{sfn|McArthur|1992|pp=64, 610\u2013611}} It has developed features such as [[English modal verb|modal verbs]] and [[word order]] as resources for conveying meaning. [[Auxiliary verb]]s mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the [[Grammatical voice|passive voice]] and progressive [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].\n\n==== Basic constituent order ====\n\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO).{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=553}} The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''.\n\nIn most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=550}} The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| ''The dog'' || ''bites'' || ''the man''\n|-\n| S || V || O\n|-\n| ''The man'' || ''bites'' || ''the dog''\n|-\n| S || V || O\n|}\n\nAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cases of Nouns and Pronouns |url=http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/cases.htm |website=Guide to Grammar and Writing |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| ''He'' || ''hit'' || ''him''\n|-\n| S || V || O\n|}\n\n[[Indirect object]]s (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as ''I gave <u>Jane</u> the book'' or in a prepositional phrase, such as ''I gave the book <u>to Jane</u>''.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=551}}\n\n==== Clause syntax ====\n{{Main|English clause syntax}}\n\nIn English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase ''I think (that) you are lying'', the main clause is headed by the verb ''think'', the subject is ''I'', but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause ''(that) you are lying''. The subordinating conjunction ''that'' shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=60\u201369}} [[Relative clause]]s are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence ''I saw the letter that you received today'', the relative clause ''that you received today'' specifies the meaning of the word ''letter'', the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns ''who'', ''whose'', ''whom'' and ''which'' as well as by ''that'' (which can also be omitted.){{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=545}} In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.{{sfn|K\u00f6nig|1994|page=557}}\n\n==== Auxiliary verb constructions ====\n{{Main|Do-support|Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion}}\n\nEnglish syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence ''the dog did not find its bone'', the clause ''find its bone'' is the complement of the negated verb ''did not''. [[Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion]] is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.\n\nThe verb ''do'' can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I ''did'' shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English [[syntax]] permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. [[Modern English]] does not allow the addition of the negating adverb ''not'' to an ordinary [[finite verb|finite]] lexical verb, as in ''*I know not''\u2014it can only be added to an auxiliary (or [[copular verb|copular]]) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary ''do'' is used, to produce a form like ''I do not (don't) know.'' The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions\u2014inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say ''*Know you him?''; grammatical rules require ''Do you know him?''{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=114}}\n\nNegation is done with the adverb ''not'', which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not ''-n't'' can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb ''to be''. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English ''I don't know him'' is the correct answer to the question ''Do you know him?'', but not ''*I know him not'', although this construction may be found in older English.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=786\u2013790}}\n\nPassive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb ''to be'' or ''to get'', although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with ''get''. For example, putting the sentence ''she sees him'' into the passive becomes ''he is seen (by her)'', or ''he gets seen (by her)''.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=26\u201327}}\n\n==== Questions ====\n\nBoth [[yes\u2013no question]]s and [[wh-question|''wh''-questions]] in English are mostly formed using [[subject\u2013auxiliary inversion]] (''Am I going tomorrow?'', ''Where can we eat?''), which may require [[do-support|''do''-support]] (''Do you like her?'', ''Where did he go?''). In most cases, [[interrogative word]]s (''wh''-words; e.g. ''what'', ''who'', ''where'', ''when'', ''why'', ''how'') appear in a [[Wh-movement|fronted position]]. For example, in the question ''What did you see?'', the word ''what'' appears as the first constituent despite being the [[grammatical object]] of the sentence. (When the ''wh''-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: ''Who saw the cat?''.) [[Prepositional phrases]] can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. ''To whose house did you go last night?''. The personal interrogative pronoun ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant ''whom'' serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=7-8}}\n\n==== Discourse level syntax ====\nWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a [[Topic and comment|topic-comment]] structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, ''the girl was stung by the bee''. Another way is through a [[cleft sentence]] where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a [[dummy subject]] such as ''it'' or ''there'', e.g. ''it was the girl that the bee stung'', ''there was a girl who was stung by a bee''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=1365\u201370}} Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., ''it is raining'') or in existential clauses (''there are many cars on the street''). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.\n\n[[Focus (linguistics)|Focus constructions]] emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, ''the girl was stung by <u>a bee</u>'' (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or ''<u>The girl</u> was stung by a bee'' (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1370}} Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, ''That girl over there, she was stung by a bee'', emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, ''she was stung by a bee, that girl over there'', where reference to the girl is established as an \"afterthought\".{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1366}}\n\n[[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] (e.g. ''that is exactly what I mean'' where ''that'' refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or ''then'' used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).{{sfn|Halliday|Hasan|1976}} [[Discourse marker]]s such as ''oh'', ''so'' or ''well'', also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for [[Stance (linguistics)|stance taking]] in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, ''no way is that true!'' (the idiomatic marker ''no way!'' expressing disbelief), or ''boy! I'm hungry'' (the marker ''boy'' expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.{{sfn|Schiffrin|1988}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n{{See also|Foreign language influences in English}}\nEnglish is a rich language in terms of vocabulary, containing more [[synonyms]] than any other language.{{sfn|Jambor|2007}} There are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which, in fact, have slightly different shades of meaning and must be chosen appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message intended. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if [[obsolete word]]s are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' from 1989.<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language \"How many words are there in the English language?\"], Oxford Dictionaries</ref> Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1&nbsp;million words\u2014but that count presumably includes words such as Latin [[species name]]s, [[scientific terminology]], [[botanical terms]], [[prefix]]ed and [[suffix]]ed words, [[jargon]], foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical [[acronym]]s.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}\n\nDue to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly, and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by [[Lexicography|lexicographers]], the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality [[Corpus linguistics|linguistic corpora]],{{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=24\u201350}} collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}\n\n=== Word formation processes ===\nEnglish forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}} producing compound words such as ''babysitter'' or ''ice cream'' or ''homesick''.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (''-hood'', ''-ness'', ''-ing'', ''-ility'') to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|Latin]] or [[English words of Greek origin|Greek origin]]).\n\nFormation of new words, called [[neologisms]], based on [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek and/or Latin roots]] (for example ''television'' or ''optometry'') is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the \"[[international scientific vocabulary]]\" (ISV) when compiling ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=120\u2013121}} words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. ''NATO'', ''laser'').\n\n=== Word origins ===\n{{Main|Lists of English loanwords by country or language of origin}}\n{{Pie chart\n|caption=Source languages of English vocabulary<ref name=\"Wolff\"/><ref>{{cite book|title = Joseph M.

This adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007|p=7}} The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.{{sfn|Nation|2001|p=265}} The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are mainly the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}\n\nBut one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of \"Latinate\" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}} Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.<ref name=\"dailymotion\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&#039;incroyable histoire des mots fran\u00e7ais dans la langue anglaise \u2013 Vid\u00e9o dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and [[northern England]]. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as ''egg'' and ''knife''.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007}}\n\nEnglish has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=4}} English continues to gain new loanwords and [[calques]] (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Fasold|Connor-Linton|2014|p=302}}\n\nEnglish has formal and informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|speech registers]]; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=124\u2013127}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n=== English loanwords and calques in other languages ===\nEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}}{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=692}} The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world ''lingua franca'', and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=197}} That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=198}} Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as [[calque]]s, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}} Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}}\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{See also|English alphabet|English braille|English orthography}}\n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a [[Latin alphabet]] (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.{{sfn|Gneuss|2013|p=23}} The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the [[Latin script]]: [[a]], [[b]], [[c]], [[d]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[o]], [[p]], [[q]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[v]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[z]] (which also have [[Letter case|capital]] forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nThe spelling system, or [[orthography]], of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} Further complications have arisen through [[sound change]]s with which the orthography has not kept pace.{{sfn|Lass|2000}} Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.{{sfn|Mountford|2006}} There are also systematic [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences between British and American English]]. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.{{sfn|Neijt|2006}}\n\nAlthough letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words ''photograph'', ''photography'', and ''photographic'',{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or the words ''electricity'' and ''electrical''. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}} The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|p=156}} Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nReaders of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] used to spell consonant sounds. The letters ''b'', ''d'', ''f'', ''h'', ''j'', ''k'', ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''p'', ''r'', ''s'', ''t'', ''v'', ''w'', ''y'', ''z'' represent, respectively, the phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, f, h, d\u0292, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/}}. The letters ''c'' and ''g'' normally represent {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, but there is also a [[soft c|soft ''c'']] pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}, and a [[Hard and soft G|soft ''g'']] pronounced {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters ''c'' and ''g'' are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ''ch'' for {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, ''sh'' for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, ''th'' for {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} or {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, ''ng'' for {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, ''qu'' for {{IPA|/kw/}}, and ''ph'' for {{IPA|/f/}} in Greek-derived words. The single letter ''x'' is generally pronounced as {{IPA|/z/}} in word-initial position and as {{IPA|/ks/}} otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=654}}\n\nFor the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''w'', ''y''). As a result, some \"[[Vowel length#Short and long vowels in English|long vowels]]\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the ''oa'' in ''boat'', the ''ow'' in ''how'', and the ''ay'' in ''stay''), or the historically based [[silent e|silent ''e'']] (as in ''note'' and ''cake'').{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}}\n\nThe consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.{{sfn|Dehaene|2009}} Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.{{sfn|McGuinness|1997}}{{sfn|Shaywitz|2003}} Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=159}}\n\nEnglish writing also includes a system of [[punctuation]] marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.{{sfn|Lawler|2006|p=290}}\n\n== Dialects, accents, and varieties ==\n{{Main|List of dialects of the English language|World Englishes|regional accents of English}}\n\nDialectologists identify many [[List of dialects of the English language|English dialects]], which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate [[Regional accents of English|regional accents]]. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of [[British English]] (BrE) and [[North American English]] (NAE).{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=107}} There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]].\n\n=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===\n{{See also|English language in England|Northern England English|Scots language|Scottish English|Welsh English|Estuary English|Ulster English|Hiberno-English}}\n\n[[File:Dialects of English in UK and Ireland.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the main dialect regions in the UK and Ireland]]\n\nAs the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), an educated dialect of [[South East England]], is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the [[Survey of English Dialects]], grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|p=125}}\n\nNonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact, only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=3}} There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=37}} Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered \"non-standard\" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is [[H-dropping]], which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England\u2014yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=40}}\n\n{{listen|filename=Russell brand bbc radio4 desert island discs 21 07 2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of an [[Essex]] male with a working-class [[Estuary English|Estuary accent]] of the region around London ([[Russell Brand]]).}}\n{{listen|filename=Recording of speaker of British English (Received Pronunciation).ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of an English female with a [[Received Pronunciation]] or \"[[standard English|Standard]] British\" accent.}}\n{{listen|filename=RenfrewshireAccent.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a [[Renfrewshire]] male with a [[Scottish accent]].}}\n{{listen|filename=Mary Robinson - Desert Island Discs - 28 July 2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of a woman with a supraregional [[Irish accent]] ([[Mary Robinson]]).}}\n\n[[English language in England|English in England]] can be divided into four major dialect regions, [[West Country dialects|Southwest English]], South East English, Midlands English, and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects and the [[Geordie]] dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in [[Liverpool]] ([[Scouse]]) and [[Manchester]] ([[Manchester dialect|Mancunian]]). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|p=31}}\n\nSince the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the [[Cockney]] dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ee-faqs-jcw.htm |title=Estuary English Q and A - JCW |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|p=80}} Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of [[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]] (''drawing'' is pronounced ''drawring'' {{IPA|/\u02c8dr\u0254\u02d0r\u026a\u014b/}}), [[t-glottalization|''t''-glottalisation]] (''Potter'' is pronounced with a glottal stop as ''Po'er'' {{IPA|/po\u0294\u028c/}}), and the pronunciation of ''th-'' as {{IPA|/f/}} (''thanks'' pronounced ''fanks'') or {{IPA|/v/}} (''bother'' pronounced ''bover'').{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|pages=80\u201381}}\n\n[[Scots language|Scots]] is today considered a separate language from English, but it has [[History of the Scots language|its origins]] in early Northern Middle English{{sfn|Aitken|McArthur|1979|page=81}} and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]] and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, [[Scottish English]] comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.{{sfn|Romaine|1982}}\n\nIn [[Ireland]], various forms of English have been spoken since the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasions]] of the 11th century. In [[County Wexford]], in the area surrounding [[Dublin]], two extinct dialects known as [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy]] and [[Fingallian]] developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into [[Ulster English]], the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]] which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86\u201387}}{{sfn|Hickey|2007}}\n\n=== North America ===\n{{Main|American English|General American|African American Vernacular English|Southern American English|Canadian English}}\n{{listen|filename=Emery Emery Voice.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern U.S.]] male with a [[general American]] accent ([[Emery Emery]]).}}\n{{listen|filename=George W.

Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in ''the government is'' rather than ''are'').{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=16\u201321}}{{sfn|Burridge|2010}} New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=24\u201326}}{{sfn|Maclagan|2010}}{{sfn|Gordon|Campbell|Hay et al.|2004}}\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\n{{Main|Philippine English|Singapore English}}\nThe first significant exposure of the [[Philippines]] to the English language occurred in 1762 when the [[British occupation of Manila|British occupied Manila]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence.

Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, from street signs and marquees, government documents and forms, courtrooms, the media and entertainment industries, the business sector, and other aspects of daily life. One such usage that is also prominent in the country is in speech, where most [[Filipinos]] from [[Manila]] would use or have been exposed to [[Taglish]], a form of code-switching between [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and English.

There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.{{sfn|Lanham|1982}} Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.{{sfn|Lass|2002}} Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k/ without aspiration (e.g. ''pin'' pronounced {{IPA|[p\u026an]}} rather than as {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u026an]}} as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap {{IPA|[\u027e]}} instead of as the more common fricative.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=30\u201331}}\n\n{{listen|filename=Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie_bbc_radio4_front_row_03_05_2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of a woman with an educated [[Nigerian English|Nigerian accent]] ([[Chimamanda Adichie]])}}\nNigerian English is a [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect of English]] spoken in [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861683342/Nigerian_English.html|title=Nigerian English|work=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909162439/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861683342/Nigerian_English.html|archivedate=9 September 2010}}</ref> It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. ''senior wife''). Over 150&nbsp;million Nigerians speak English.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adegbija |first1=Efurosibina |title=Lexico-semantic variation in Nigerian English |journal=World Englishes |date=1989 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013177 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.1989.tb00652.x}}</ref>\n\nSeveral varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the [[Leeward Islands|Leeward]] and [[Windward Islands]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and [[Belize]]. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican English Creole|Jamaican Creole]]. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.{{sfn|Lawton|1982}} Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and [[code-switching]] between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as \"basilect\" and the more RP-like forms serving as the \"acrolect\", the most formal register.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|page=115}}\n\nMost Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}} are monophthongs {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} or even the reverse diphthongs {{IPA|[ie]}} and {{IPA|[uo]}} (e.g. ''bay'' and ''boat'' pronounced {{IPA|[b\u02b2e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[b\u02b7o\u02d0t]}}). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283ail]}} and \"wind\" {{IPA|[win]}}.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=117\u201318}}{{sfn|Lawton|1982|page=256\u201360}}{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=115\u201316}}\n\n{{listen|filename=Vandana Shiva BBC Radio4 Saving Species 23 Dec 2011 b010x8sq.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of a [[North India]]n woman with an [[Indian English|Indian accent]] ([[Vandana Shiva]])}}\nAs a historical legacy, [[Indian English]] tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as {{IPA|[\u0288]}} and {{IPA|[\u0256]}}) and the replacement of {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} with dentals {{IPA|[t\u032a]}} and {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent {{angbr|h}} found in words such as ''ghost'' is pronounced as an Indian [[Breathy voice|voiced aspirated]] stop {{IPA|[\u0261\u02b1]}}.{{sfn|Sailaja|2009|pages=19\u201324}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n<!-- The entries in the bibliography are in alphabetical order.

Charlamagne questioned why Birdman was angry at him and not the artists themselves, and Birdman left the interview after just over two minutes. The interview went viral and resulted in numerous memes based on the incident.

Starr responded by branding Charlamagne a \"pussy\", and made reference to Charlamagne being attacked on camera outside of the [[Power 105.1]] building. Starr was eventually calmed down by fellow Onyx member [[Sticky Fingaz]], and eventually finished the interview, however, the resulting video went viral, and led to Starr becoming the face of ''The Breakfast Club''<nowiki/>'s \"P.O.

Charlamagne branded Sigel a hypocrite, who responded by saying he felt Charlamagne was a \"sucker\" for letting Fredro Starr disrespect him live on air, and criticised him for making rapper [[Lil Mama]] cry, calling him a coward. Siegel threatened to walk out numerous times before eventually finishing the interview.

Charlamagne's direct criticism of guests during interviews has resulted in numerous altercations and arguments on air.\n\n===Lil' Mama===\nIn a 2011 interview with Lil' Mama, Charlamagne confronted the rapper, saying, \"you come off as cocky\" and insinuated that she hadn't accomplished enough to be cocky. He additionally alluded to his belief that her criticism of other rappers' behavior should be communicated through her music rather than stated in the media. He provoked the rapper/actress by calling her the \"voice of the young struggle-face,\" digging at her appearance.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2495794/lil-mama-defends-nicki-minaj-comments-breaks-down-on-air/|title=Lil Mama Defends Nicki Minaj Comments, Breaks Down Crying On Air|first=MTV News|last=Staff|website=MTV News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/the-breakfast-club-and-all-its-problematic-banter/|title='The Breakfast Club' And All Its Problematic Banter: Is It Time For A Boycott?|first=Zahara|last=Hill|date=August 3, 2017|website=EBONY}}</ref> He went on to say, \"you're young and you have an old face; like [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] says, 'I'm really too young to be looking this old.'\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2015/09/lil-mama-interview|title=Inside the Dramatic Exit and Surprising Return of Lil Mama|website=Complex}}</ref> \n\nShe returned to ''The Breakfast Club'' for a less tense interview on January 12, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C0iE8v4i7k|title=Lil Mama Interview at The Breakfast Club Power 105.1 (01/12/2016)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n=== Birdman ===\n\nRapper [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] walked out of his interview with ''The Breakfast Club'' on April 22, 2016, after just over two minutes, claiming the hosts, specifically Charlamagne, were not \"putting respect on his name\". Birdman was angry at the hosts allowing artists such as [[Trick Daddy]] and [[Rick Ross]] to appear on the show and make disparaging remarks about him. Charlamagne questioned why Birdman was angry at him and not the artists themselves, and Birdman left the interview after just over two minutes. The interview went viral and resulted in numerous memes based on the incident. It is the shortest interview in ''Breakfast Club'' history.<ref name=\"platon2016\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7341706/birdman-breakfast-club-short-interview|title=Birdman Asks the Breakfast Club to 'Respect My Name' in Swift Sit-Down: Watch|last=Platon|first=Adelle|date=2016-04-22|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425055236/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7341706/birdman-breakfast-club-short-interview|archive-date=25 April 2016|access-date=4 March 2020|quote=A Breakfast Club interview went left on Friday morning (April 22[, 2016]) after Cash Money chief [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] paid Charlamagne Tha God, Angela Yee and DJ Envy a two-and-a-half-minute visit.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jLT7GQYNhI|title=Birdman Goes Off On The Breakfast Club Power 105.1 (04/22/2016)|date=April 22, 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== Fredro Starr ===\n\nIn the summer of 2014, hip-hop group [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]] appeared on ''The Breakfast Club''. Tensions rose between member [[Fredro Starr]] and Charlamagne after Charlamagne brought up Starr allegedly receiving oral sex from singer [[Brandy Norwood]]. Starr responded by branding Charlamagne a \"pussy\", and made reference to Charlamagne being attacked on camera outside of the [[Power 105.1]] building. Starr was eventually calmed down by fellow Onyx member [[Sticky Fingaz]], and eventually finished the interview, however, the resulting video went viral, and led to Starr becoming the face of ''The Breakfast Club''<nowiki/>'s \"P.O.

Sigel grew annoyed with Charlamagne's perceived attempts at escalating the feud between himself and [[Meek Mill]], complaining that Charlamagne was \"harping on the issue\". Charlamagne branded Sigel a hypocrite, who responded by saying he felt Charlamagne was a \"sucker\" for letting Fredro Starr disrespect him live on air, and criticised him for making rapper [[Lil Mama]] cry, calling him a coward. Siegel threatened to walk out numerous times before eventually finishing the interview.

He played [[college basketball]] for the [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado Buffaloes]] and earned first-team [[List of All-Pac-12 Conference men's basketball teams|all-conference]] honors in the [[Pac-12 Conference men's basketball|Pac-12]] as a sophomore in 2013. He missed most of his junior year after injuring his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL). Dinwiddie recovered and was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the second round of the [[2014 NBA draft]]. After two seasons with the Pistons, he joined the Nets in December 2016. In December 2018 he signed a three-year contract extension with the Nets.\n\n==High school career==\nAt [[William Howard Taft High School (Los Angeles)|William Howard Taft High School]], Dinwiddie was recognized as one of the greatest standout athletes since [[Jordan Farmar]]. He averaged 5.9 points and 4.1 assists as the starting [[point guard]] alongside a fellow [[2014 NBA draft|2014 draftee]] in [[DeAndre Daniels]] at the conclusion of his junior season. Dinwiddie maximized his game as he began his final year representing the school, averaging 11.2 points and 7.7 assists. He was one of the most skilled passers in school history, and became the John R. Wooden California High School Player of the Year in 2011. However, [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School|Long Beach Poly]]'s Ryan Anderson was named [[California Mr. Basketball]]. Dinwiddie became just one of seven players that won the prestigious award as a senior. The powerful duo of Daniels and Dinwiddie won the city championship this season as well. This final season at Taft helped Dinwiddie gain the attention of colleges around the country. He chose to attend [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]] rather than [[Harvard Crimson men's basketball|Harvard]], [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]], [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|Santa Clara]], or [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]].\n\nConsidered a three-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Dinwiddie was listed as the No. 25 point guard and the No. 146 player in the nation in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spencer Dinwiddie Recruiting Profile|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/basketball/recruiting/player-Spencer-Dinwiddie-113200|work=Rivals.com|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\n\n===Freshman===\nIn the first regular season game for [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]], Dinwiddie made his collegiate debut in a 32-point victory over [[Fort Lewis Skyhawks|Fort Lewis]] with seven points and seven rebounds. He shot just 2-for-9 from the [[Field goal (basketball)|field]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado 85, Fort Lewis 57|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313150038|website=ESPN.com|date=November 11, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Dinwiddie reached double figures in his sixth appearance, which was against [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]]. This was the first time he had shot over .500 on field goals up till then. The [[California]] native led the team to this win and made three key free throws in the final seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado 70, Georgia 68|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313320038|website=ESPN.com|date=November 28, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Dinwiddie teamed with fellow freshman [[Askia Booker]], forming another duo on his new team. They combined for 677 points, making school history by scoring over 250 points each. At the conclusion of the season, they were the only Buffaloes to do so. Dinwiddie became a member of the Pac-12 Conference Tournament Championship Team. He led Colorado in free throw percentage and ranked third among freshmen in that category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado Buffaloes 2011-12 Statistics|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/stats/_/id/38/year/2012/colorado-buffaloes|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> By the end of the regular season, Dinwiddie had helped the team earn its first [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] berth since the 2002\u201303 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=2002-03 Colorado Buffaloes Roster|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/colorado/2003.html|website=Sports-reference.com|access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Shooting [[Three-point field goal|three-pointers]] at .438 clip, Dinwiddie was named to the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] All-Freshman Team with [[Tony Wroten]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Topham|first1=David|title=Detroit Pistons: Analyzing the Spencer Dinwiddie pick|url=http://isportsweb.com/2014/06/29/detroit-pistons-analyzing-spencer-dinwiddie-pick/|website=isportsweb.com|date=June 29, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref> He was the only Pac-12 freshman to have a field-goal percentage of over .400 total.\n\n===Sophomore===\nThe departures of [[Carlon Brown]] and Nate Tomlinson were instrumental in Dinwiddie's breakout sophomore season. Leading the team in assists, they reached the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] for the second consecutive season, in which they reached the second round. It was the first time the team had reached back-to-back tournaments since the 1963 season. The Buffaloes won the 2012 [[Charleston Classic]], in which Dinwiddie took the role as starting [[small forward]] in the final three rounds. He was just one of two players \u2013 the other being Askia Booker \u2013 to start all 33 games. By the end of the season, Booker and Dinwiddie became the highest sophomore scoring tandem in school history. Dinwiddie led the team in assists 20 times and was the top scorer on 15 different occasions. He recorded 29 points in a home win over [[Colorado State Rams men's basketball|Colorado State]], which marked his own career-high scoring record. On February 10, 2012, Dinwiddie recorded a perfect game against [[Oregon State Beavers men's basketball|Oregon State]]. He shot 6-for-6 from the field, 4-for-4 from beyond the arc, and 8-for-8 on free throws. This set the school record for most points scored without missing a single shot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spencer Dinwiddie Player Profile|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Spencer-Dinwiddie/GameLogs/30385/NCAA/2013/All|website=RealGM.com|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref> He made the remark, \"I see over people and I shoot over people... for the smaller point guards, they don't really get to contest me.\" The [[William Howard Taft Charter High School (Los Angeles)|Taft]] graduate stood {{height|ft=6|in=6}} by the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thorburn|first1=Ryan|title=Men's basketball: CU Buffs will rely on Askia Booker and Spencer Dinwiddie|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_21804927/mens-basketball-cu-buffs-will-rely-askia-booker|website=Buffzone.com|publisher=Daily Camera|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Junior===\nDinwiddie continued to act as the leader of the [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball]] team through the beginning of his junior year. He helped the team win 14 of their first 16 regular season games, which made them one of the most successful underdogs in the country, most notably toppling the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas Jayhawks]] due to a game-winner from [[Askia Booker]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dauster|first=Rob|title=Colorado needs game-winner to serve as a catalyst for Askia Booker (Video)|url=http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/12/07/askia-booker-beats-kansas-at-the-buzzer-video/|website=NBCSports.com|date=December 7, 2013|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> Dinwiddie was considered the catalyst for the unanticipated run from his team, however. On November 21, 2012, he shot a career-best 14-for-15 from the [[Free throw|free throw line]] against [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's basketball|Santa Barbara]].

[[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He played [[college basketball]] for the [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado Buffaloes]] and earned first-team [[List of All-Pac-12 Conference men's basketball teams|all-conference]] honors in the [[Pac-12 Conference men's basketball|Pac-12]] as a sophomore in 2013. He missed most of his junior year after injuring his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL). Dinwiddie recovered and was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the second round of the [[2014 NBA draft]]. After two seasons with the Pistons, he joined the Nets in December 2016. In December 2018 he signed a three-year contract extension with the Nets.\n\n==High school career==\nAt [[William Howard Taft High School (Los Angeles)|William Howard Taft High School]], Dinwiddie was recognized as one of the greatest standout athletes since [[Jordan Farmar]]. He averaged 5.9 points and 4.1 assists as the starting [[point guard]] alongside a fellow [[2014 NBA draft|2014 draftee]] in [[DeAndre Daniels]] at the conclusion of his junior season. Dinwiddie maximized his game as he began his final year representing the school, averaging 11.2 points and 7.7 assists. He was one of the most skilled passers in school history, and became the John R. Wooden California High School Player of the Year in 2011. However, [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School|Long Beach Poly]]'s Ryan Anderson was named [[California Mr. Basketball]]. Dinwiddie became just one of seven players that won the prestigious award as a senior. The powerful duo of Daniels and Dinwiddie won the city championship this season as well. This final season at Taft helped Dinwiddie gain the attention of colleges around the country. He chose to attend [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]] rather than [[Harvard Crimson men's basketball|Harvard]], [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]], [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|Santa Clara]], or [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]].\n\nConsidered a three-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Dinwiddie was listed as the No. 25 point guard and the No. 146 player in the nation in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spencer Dinwiddie Recruiting Profile|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/basketball/recruiting/player-Spencer-Dinwiddie-113200|work=Rivals.com|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\n\n===Freshman===\nIn the first regular season game for [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]], Dinwiddie made his collegiate debut in a 32-point victory over [[Fort Lewis Skyhawks|Fort Lewis]] with seven points and seven rebounds. He shot just 2-for-9 from the [[Field goal (basketball)|field]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado 85, Fort Lewis 57|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313150038|website=ESPN.com|date=November 11, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Dinwiddie reached double figures in his sixth appearance, which was against [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]]. This was the first time he had shot over .500 on field goals up till then. The [[California]] native led the team to this win and made three key free throws in the final seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado 70, Georgia 68|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313320038|website=ESPN.com|date=November 28, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Dinwiddie teamed with fellow freshman [[Askia Booker]], forming another duo on his new team. They combined for 677 points, making school history by scoring over 250 points each. At the conclusion of the season, they were the only Buffaloes to do so. Dinwiddie became a member of the Pac-12 Conference Tournament Championship Team. He led Colorado in free throw percentage and ranked third among freshmen in that category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colorado Buffaloes 2011-12 Statistics|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/stats/_/id/38/year/2012/colorado-buffaloes|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> By the end of the regular season, Dinwiddie had helped the team earn its first [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] berth since the 2002\u201303 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=2002-03 Colorado Buffaloes Roster|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/colorado/2003.html|website=Sports-reference.com|access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Shooting [[Three-point field goal|three-pointers]] at .438 clip, Dinwiddie was named to the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] All-Freshman Team with [[Tony Wroten]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Topham|first1=David|title=Detroit Pistons: Analyzing the Spencer Dinwiddie pick|url=http://isportsweb.com/2014/06/29/detroit-pistons-analyzing-spencer-dinwiddie-pick/|website=isportsweb.com|date=June 29, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref> He was the only Pac-12 freshman to have a field-goal percentage of over .400 total.\n\n===Sophomore===\nThe departures of [[Carlon Brown]] and Nate Tomlinson were instrumental in Dinwiddie's breakout sophomore season. Leading the team in assists, they reached the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] for the second consecutive season, in which they reached the second round. It was the first time the team had reached back-to-back tournaments since the 1963 season. The Buffaloes won the 2012 [[Charleston Classic]], in which Dinwiddie took the role as starting [[small forward]] in the final three rounds. He was just one of two players \u2013 the other being Askia Booker \u2013 to start all 33 games. By the end of the season, Booker and Dinwiddie became the highest sophomore scoring tandem in school history. Dinwiddie led the team in assists 20 times and was the top scorer on 15 different occasions. He recorded 29 points in a home win over [[Colorado State Rams men's basketball|Colorado State]], which marked his own career-high scoring record. On February 10, 2012, Dinwiddie recorded a perfect game against [[Oregon State Beavers men's basketball|Oregon State]]. He shot 6-for-6 from the field, 4-for-4 from beyond the arc, and 8-for-8 on free throws. This set the school record for most points scored without missing a single shot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spencer Dinwiddie Player Profile|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Spencer-Dinwiddie/GameLogs/30385/NCAA/2013/All|website=RealGM.com|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref> He made the remark, \"I see over people and I shoot over people... for the smaller point guards, they don't really get to contest me.\" The [[William Howard Taft Charter High School (Los Angeles)|Taft]] graduate stood {{height|ft=6|in=6}} by the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thorburn|first1=Ryan|title=Men's basketball: CU Buffs will rely on Askia Booker and Spencer Dinwiddie|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_21804927/mens-basketball-cu-buffs-will-rely-askia-booker|website=Buffzone.com|publisher=Daily Camera|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Junior===\nDinwiddie continued to act as the leader of the [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball]] team through the beginning of his junior year. He helped the team win 14 of their first 16 regular season games, which made them one of the most successful underdogs in the country, most notably toppling the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas Jayhawks]] due to a game-winner from [[Askia Booker]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dauster|first=Rob|title=Colorado needs game-winner to serve as a catalyst for Askia Booker (Video)|url=http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/12/07/askia-booker-beats-kansas-at-the-buzzer-video/|website=NBCSports.com|date=December 7, 2013|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> Dinwiddie was considered the catalyst for the unanticipated run from his team, however. On November 21, 2012, he shot a career-best 14-for-15 from the [[Free throw|free throw line]] against [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's basketball|Santa Barbara]]. Colorado won each game in which their top scorer scored 20 or more points total.\n\nOn January 12, 2014, Dinwiddie suffered a career-threatening [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] injury against [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]], forcing him to sit out for the remainder of the season. As his junior season was cut short, the team finished the year just 23\u201312; their record was 14\u20132 while Dinwiddie was healthy. Dinwiddie reportedly made contact with Russ Paine, who helped [[Adrian Peterson]] recover from his ACL injury and become the 2012 [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL MVP]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Jeff|title=Spencer Dinwiddie has torn ACL|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/10288706/colorado-buffaloes-star-spencer-dinwiddie-season|website=ESPN.com|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=Brendan|title=Get to know, Spencer Dinwiddie: Detroit Pistons draft pick rehabbed with NFL star's therapist|url=http://www.mlive.com/pistons/index.ssf/2014/06/get_to_know_spencer_dinwiddie.html|website=MLive|date=June 27, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn April 24, 2014, Dinwiddie declared for the NBA draft, foregoing his final year of college eligibility.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kensler|first1=Tom|title=CU Buffs point guard Spencer Dinwiddie declares for the 2014 NBA draft|url=http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_25630281/cus-spencer-dinwiddie-will-forego-senior-year-declares|work=DenverPost.com|date=April 24, 2014|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Detroit Pistons (2014\u20132016)===\n[[File:Spencer Dinwiddie, Ramon Sessions (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dinwiddie with the Pistons in February 2015]]\nDinwiddie was selected with the 38th overall pick by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[2014 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valdez|first1=Alexandria|title=Spencer Dinwiddie drafted by Pistons in second round at No. 38|url=http://www.denverpost.com/nuggets/ci_26043122/spencer-dinwiddie-drafted-by-pistons-second-round-at|work=DenverPost.com|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> He appeared in 34 games for the Pistons as a rookie, making one start<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dinwisp01/gamelog/2015/|title=Spencer Dinwiddie 2014-15 Game Log|work=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> and receiving two assignments to the [[Grand Rapids Drive]], the Pistons' [[NBA Development League|D-League]] affiliate.<ref name=assignments>{{cite web|url=https://gleague.nba.com/all-time-nba-assignments/|title=All-Time NBA Assignments|work=NBA.com|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> His lone start came on February 20, 2015, after a pair of trades left the Pistons short-handed.
