It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack.

Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window.

{"title_page": "Marguerite and Armand", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n'''''Marguerite and Armand''''' is a ballet danced to an orchestral arrangement of [[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Piano Sonata (Liszt)|B minor piano sonata]]. It was created in 1963 by the British choreographer [[Frederick Ashton|Sir Frederick Ashton]] specifically for [[Rudolf Nureyev]] and [[Margot Fonteyn]]. The ballet takes its inspiration from the 19th-century novel ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'']], and other adaptations of the same story such as [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[La traviata]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nMarguerite Gautier, a Parisian courtesan, lies on her deathbed, gravely ill with [[tuberculosis]].  In her delirium she recalls her love affair with a young man named Armand, which the ballet portrays using many dreamlike flashback sequences.\n\nIn the first flashback, Marguerite, wearing a red dress, is surrounded by admirers and suitors. She lets them flirt with her, but feels no real emotions. Armand enters and falls for Marguerite immediately, and she returns his feelings. At the end of this sequence, Marguerite tests Armand's love by throwing a white flower to the ground as her wealthy protector leads her away. Another suitor goes to pick up the flower, but when Armand moves to take it, the other man lets him. This symbolizes Marguerite and Armand as a couple.\n\nMarguerite, now increasingly ill, deserts her wealthy protector to live in the countryside with Armand. However, Armand's father asks her to quit her lover; she agrees, but will not tell Armand why she must leave him. A despairing Marguerite is about to leave the country house when Armand enters, and becomes distressed upon seeing her so distraught. A passionate sequence follows, portraying the characters' love, Marguerite's sacrifice and Armand's confusion.\n\nArmand, angered by Marguerite's lack of an explanation, publicly humiliates her by tearing the necklace given to her by her wealthy protector from her neck and throwing it to the floor, and throwing money in her face.\n\nIn the final scenes, sad and alone, Marguerite waits for inevitable death. However, Armand's father has revealed the truth to him and Armand makes it back to the apartment to hold Marguerite one last time. She dies in his arms.\n\n==Dancers==\nThe ballet was particularly associated with Nureyev and Fonteyn, the original performers. It featured in their farewell performances in ''[[Fonteyn & Nureyev on Broadway]]''. Revivals of the ballet have starred pairings such as [[Sylvie Guillem]] and [[Nicolas Le Riche]], [[Zenaida Yanowsky]] and [[Federico Bonelli]], and [[Tamara Rojo]] and [[Sergei Polunin]].<ref>[http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/performance.aspx?performance=24427&row=86 \"Marguerite and Armand: 20 October 2011\"], Royal Opera House performance database.

The piece was performed in a triple bill alongside [[Kenneth MacMillan]]'s ''Concerto'' and [[Peter Wright (dancer)|Peter Wright]]'s ''Summertide''.

They usually write the ''[[#Daybooks|daybook]]s'' (which contain records of sales, purchases, receipts, and payments), and document each financial transaction, whether cash or credit, into the correct daybook\u2014that is, petty cash book, suppliers ledger, customer ledger, etc.\u2014and the [[general ledger]]. Thereafter, an accountant can create financial reports from the information recorded by the bookkeeper.\n\nBookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of financial accounting, and involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of a business.\n\nThe bookkeeper brings the books to the [[trial balance]] stage: an accountant may prepare the [[income statement]] and [[balance sheet]] using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.\n\nIt's easy to [https://www.jinglingmoney.com/bookkeeping-for-small-businesses/ keep books for a business] if the keeper knows about nature of transaction and some basics which are essential to follow in preparing books.\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researches indicate that methods of keeping accounts have existed from the remotest times of human life in cities. Babylonian records written with styli on small slabs of clay have been found dating to 2600 BCE.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Book-Keeping|volume=4|page=225}}</ref> \nThe term \"waste book\" was used in colonial America, referring to the documenting of daily transactions of receipts and expenditures. Records were made in chronological order, and for temporary use only. Daily records were then transferred to a daybook or account ledger to balance the accounts and to create a permanent journal; then the waste book could be discarded, hence the name.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System |title= Pittsburgh Waste Book and Fort Pitt Trading Post Papers |url= http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=General%20John%20Forbes;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-dar192503 |access-date= 2015-09-04 }}</ref>\n\n=== Process ===\nThe bookkeeping process primarily records the ''financial effects'' of transactions. An important difference between a manual and an electronic accounting system is the former's latency between the recording of a financial transaction and its posting in the relevant account. This delay, which is absent in electronic accounting systems due to nearly instantaneous posting to relevant accounts, is characteristic of manual systems, and gave rise to the primary books of accounts\u2014cash book, purchase book, sales book, etc.\u2014for immediately documenting a financial transaction.\n\nIn the normal course of business, a document is produced each time a transaction occurs. Sales and purchases usually have [[invoice]]s or [[receipt]]s. Deposit slips are produced when lodgements (deposits) are made to a [[bank account]]. Checks (spelled \"cheques\" in the UK and several other countries) are written to pay money out of the account. Bookkeeping first involves recording the details of all of these ''source documents'' into multi-column ''journals'' (also known as ''books of first entry'' or ''daybooks''). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the sales journal; all cash payments are recorded in the cash payments journal. Each column in a journal normally corresponds to an account. In the [[single-entry accounting system|single entry system]], each transaction is recorded only once. Most individuals who balance their check-book each month are using such a system, and most personal-finance software follows this approach.\n\nAfter a certain period, typically a month, each column in each [[Journal entry|journal]] is totalled to give a summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the [[ledger]], or ''account book''. For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a debit entry is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a credit entry might be made in the account for \"Sale of class 2 widgets\" (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called  ''posting''. Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the \"T\" format undergo ''balancing'', which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.\n\nAs a partial check that the posting process was done correctly, a working document called an ''unadjusted trial balance'' is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains the names of those accounts in the [[ledger]] which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a ''debit'' balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the ''debit column''); if an account has a ''credit'' balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the ''credit column''). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. The two totals must agree\u2014which is not by chance\u2014because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.\n\nOnce the accounts balance, the accountant makes a number of adjustments and changes the balance amounts of some of the accounts. These adjustments must still obey the double-entry rule: for example, the ''[[inventory]]'' account and asset account might be changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a stocktake. At the same time, the ''expense'' account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted by an equal and opposite amount. Other adjustments such as posting [[depreciation]] and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the ''adjusted trial balance''. It is the accounts in this list, and their corresponding debit or credit balances, that are used to prepare the financial statements.\n\nFinally [[financial statement]]s are drawn from the trial balance, which may include:\n* the [[income statement]], also known as the ''statement of financial results'', ''profit and loss account'', or ''P&L''\n* the [[balance sheet]], also known as the ''statement of financial position''\n* the [[cash flow statement]]\n* the [[statement of changes in equity]], also known as the ''statement of total recognised gains and losses''\n\n== Entry systems ==\n===Single-entry system===\n{{main|single-entry bookkeeping system}}\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of this topic covered in the article re single-entry bookkeeping. -->\n\nThe primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the ''cash book'', which is similar to a checking account register (in UK: cheque account, current account), except all entries are allocated among several categories of income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as [[inventory]] and travel expenses. To save time and avoid the errors of manual calculations, single-entry bookkeeping can be done today with do-it-yourself bookkeeping software.\n\n===Double-entry system===\n{{main|double-entry bookkeeping system}}\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of the topic covered in the article on double-entry bookkeeping. -->\n\nA ''double-entry bookkeeping system'' is a set of rules for recording financial information in a [[financial accounting]] system in which every transaction or event changes at least two different nominal [[ledger]] accounts.\n\n==Daybooks==\nA ''daybook'' is a descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day [[financial transactions]]; it is also called a ''book of original entry''. The daybook's details must be transcribed formally into journals to enable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include:\n\n*Sales daybook, for recording sales invoices.\n*Sales credits daybook, for recording sales credit notes.\n*Purchases daybook, for recording purchase invoices.\n*Purchases debits daybook, for recording purchase debit notes.\n*Cash daybook, usually known as the cash book, for recording all monies received and all monies paid out. It may be split into two daybooks: a receipts daybook documenting every money-amount received, and a payments daybook recording every payment made.\n*General Journal daybook, for recording journal entries.\n\n==Petty cash book==\nA ''[[petty cash]]'' book is a record of small-value purchases before they are later transferred to the ledger and final accounts; it is maintained by a petty or junior cashier. This type of cash book usually uses the [[imprest system]]: a certain amount of money is provided to the petty cashier by the senior cashier. This money is to cater for minor expenditures (hospitality, minor stationery, casual postage, and so on) and is reimbursed periodically on satisfactory explanation of how it was spent.\nAnd also the balance of petty cash book is [[Asset]].\n\n\n==Journals==\n''[[Journal entry|Journals]]'' are recorded in the general journal daybook. A journal is a formal and chronological record of [[financial transactions]] before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as [[debits and credits]]. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (e.g., sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.), making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every [[debits and credits|debit]] journal entry recorded, there must be an equivalent [[debits and credits|credit]] journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Haber | first = Jeffry | title = Accounting Demystified | publisher = AMACOM | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8144-0790-0 | page = 15}}</ref>\n\n== Example of wrong and right Journal ==\n\n\n'''Right entry'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Date'''\n|'''Particulars'''\n|'''Debit ($)'''\n|'''Credit ($)'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |6/4/2020\n|Cash a/c \u2026\u2026\u2026 dr.\n|10\n|\u2013\n|-\n|To sales a/c \u2026\u2026..cr.\n|\u2013\n|10\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|10\n|10\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Narration: (Being chocolates sold )\n|}\n'''Wrong entry'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Date'''\n|'''Particulars'''\n|'''Debit ($)'''\n|'''Credit ($)'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |6/4/2020\n|Cash a/c \u2026\u2026\u2026 dr.\n|9\n|\u2013\n|-\n|To sales a/c \u2026\u2026..cr.\n|\u2013\n|10\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|9\n|10\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Narration: (Being chocolates sold )\n|}\nThis is a wrong entry if the seller-provided a discount of one dollar he/she must provide the entry related to it.

The ledger is a permanent summary of all amounts entered in supporting Journals which list individual transactions by date. These accounts are recorded separately, showing their beginning/ending [[Balance (accounting)|balance]]. A journal lists [[financial transactions]] in chronological order, without showing their balance but showing how much is going to be charged in each account. A ledger takes each financial transaction from the journal and records it into the corresponding account for every transaction listed. The ledger also sums up the total of every account, which is transferred into the [[balance sheet]] and the [[income statement]]. There are three different kinds of ledgers that deal with book-keeping:\n*Sales ledger, which deals mostly with the accounts receivable account. This ledger consists of the records of the financial transactions made by customers to the business.\n*Purchase ledger is the record of the purchasing transactions a company does; it goes hand in hand with the Accounts Payable account.\n\n==Abbreviations used in bookkeeping==\n* A/C \u2013 Account\n* Acc \u2013 Account\n* A/R \u2013 Accounts receivable\n* A/P \u2013 Accounts payable\n* B/S \u2013 Balance sheet\n* c/d \u2013 Carried down\n* b/d \u2013 Brought down\n* c/f \u2013 Carried forward\n* b/f \u2013 Brought forward\n* Dr \u2013 Debit side of a ledger. \"Dr\" stands for \"'''D'''ebit '''r'''egister\"\n* Cr \u2013 Credit side of a ledger. \"Cr\" stands for \"'''C'''redit '''r'''egister\"\n* G/L \u2013 General ledger; (or N/L \u2013 nominal ledger)\n* PL \u2013 Profit and loss; (or I/S \u2013 income statement)\n* P/R - Payroll\n* PP&E \u2013 Property, plant and equipment\n* TB \u2013 Trial Balance\n* GST \u2013 [[Goods and Services Tax (disambiguation)|Goods and services tax]]\n* VAT \u2013 [[Value added tax]]\n* CST \u2013 Central sale tax\n* TDS \u2013 Tax deducted at source\n* AMT \u2013 Alternate minimum tax\n* EBITDA \u2013 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation\n* EBDTA \u2013 Earnings before depreciation, taxes and amortisation\n* EBT \u2013 Earnings before tax\n* EAT \u2013 Earnings after tax\n* PAT \u2013 Profit after tax\n* PBT \u2013 Profit before tax\n* Depr \u2013 Depreciation\n* Dep \u2013 Depreciation\n* CPO \u2013 Cash paid out\n* CP - Cash Payment\n*\n\n==Chart of accounts==\nA [[chart of accounts]] is a list of the [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]] codes that can be identified with numeric, alphabetical, or alphanumeric codes allowing the account to be located in the general ledger.

In 1913, his forces captured the province of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]] from the Ottoman Turks. In 1922, he completed his conquest of the Nejd, and in 1925, he conquered the [[Hijaz]].

It became obvious that oil was going to be a crucial resource in warfare for the foreseeable future.<ref name = AB/>  Examples that proved this were \u201c[[Joseph Gallieni|General Gallieni]]\u2019s commandeering of the Paris taxi fleet to ferry soldiers to the front.

The allies took advantage of this by producing thousands of vehicles to aid their war effort.<ref name=CD/>\n* The onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Prior to the depression, a major source of income for the ruler of Hijaz was the taxes paid by pilgrims on their way to the holy cities. After the depression hit, the number of pilgrimages per year fell from 100,000 to below 40,000.<ref name = AB/> This hurt their economy greatly and they needed to find alternate sources of income. This caused Ibn Saud to get serious about the search for oil.\n\n==Initial search==\nIn 1922, Ibn Saud met a New Zealand mining engineer named [[Frank Holmes (geologist)|Major Frank Holmes]]. During World War I, Holmes had been to [[Gallipoli]] and then [[Ethiopia]], where he first heard rumours of the [[oil seep]]s of the [[Persian Gulf]] region.<ref name = AB/> He was convinced that much oil would be found throughout the region. After the war, Holmes helped to set up Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd in order, among other things, to seek oil concessions in the region.\n\nIn 1923, the king signed a [[contractual rights|concession]] with Holmes allowing him to search for oil in eastern Saudi Arabia. Eastern and General Syndicate brought in a Swiss [[geologist]] to evaluate the land, but he claimed that searching for oil in Arabia would be \u201ca pure gamble\u201d.<ref name=AB/> This discouraged the major [[bank]]s and oil companies from investing in Arabian oil ventures.\n\nIn 1925, Holmes signed a concession with the [[sheikh]] of [[Bahrain]], allowing him to search for oil there. He then proceeded to the [[United States]] to find an oil company that might be interested in taking on the concession. He found help from [[Gulf Oil]]. In 1927, Gulf Oil took control of the concessions that Holmes made years ago. But Gulf Oil was a partner in the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], which was jointly owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, Anglo-Persian, the Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles, and \"the Near East Development Company, representing the interests of the American companies.<ref name=CD/> The partners had signed up to the \u201c[[Red Line Agreement]]\u201d, which meant that Gulf Oil was precluded from taking up the Bahrain concession without the consent of the other partners; and they declined.<ref name=AB/> Despite a promising survey in Bahrain, Gulf Oil was forced to transfer its interest to another company, [[Standard Oil of California]] (SOCAL), which was not a bound by the Red Line Agreement.<ref>{{cite book |last= Keating |first= Aileen |title= Mirage:  Power, Politics, and the Hidden History of Arabian Oil |publisher= Prometheus Books |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-1-59102-346-3 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/miragepowerpolit00keat }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile Ibn Saud had dispatched American mining engineer [[Karl Twitchell]] to examine eastern Arabia. Twitchell found encouraging signs of oil, asphalt seeps in the vicinity of Qatif, but advised the king to await the outcome of the Bahrain No.1 well before inviting bids for a concession for [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Al-Ahsa]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Heather Lehr|title= [[Saudi Arabia]]|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60413-023-2}}</ref> To the American engineers working in Bahrain, standing on the Jebel Dukhan and gazing across a twenty-mile (32&nbsp;km) stretch of the [[Persian Gulf]] at the Arabian Peninsula in the clear light of early morning, the outline of the low Dhahran hills in the distance were an obvious oil prospect.\n\nOn 31 May 1932, the SOCAL subsidiary, the [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]] (BAPCO) struck oil in Bahrain.<ref name=AB/> The discovery brought fresh impetus to the search for oil on the Arabian peninsula.\n\nNegotiations for an oil concession for al-Hasa province opened at Jeddah in March, 1933. Twitchell attended with lawyer Lloyd Hamilton on behalf of SOCAL. The [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] represented by [[Stephen Hemsley Longrigg|Stephen Longrigg]] competed in the bidding, but SOCAL was granted the concession on 23 May 1933. Under the agreement, SOCAL was given \u201cexploration rights to some 930,000 square kilometers of land for 60 years\u201d.<ref name=AB/> Soon after the agreement, geologists arrived in al-Hasa and the search for oil was underway.\n\n==Discovery of oil==\nSOCAL set up a subsidiary company, the [[Saudi Aramco#History|California Arabian Standard Oil Company]] (CASOC) to develop the oil concession. SOCAL also joined forces with the Texas Oil Company when together they formed CALTEX in 1936 to take advantage of the latter's formidable marketing network in Africa and Asia.\n\nWhen CASOC geologists surveyed the concession area, they identified a promising site and named it Dammam No. 7, after a nearby village. Over the next three years, the drillers were unsuccessful in making a commercial strike, but chief geologist [[Max Steineke]] persevered. He urged the team to drill deeper, even when Dammam No. 7 was plagued by cave-ins, stuck drill bits and other problems, before the drillers finally struck oil on 3 March 1938.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.chevron.com/about/leadership/history/1927/|title=In War and Peace 1927-1946|work=About Chevron|accessdate=19 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183059/http://www.chevron.com/about/leadership/history/1927/|archivedate=8 June 2011}}</ref> This discovery would turn out to be first of many, eventually revealing the largest source of [[crude oil]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/80days/380303.html|work=Time|title=80 Days That Changed The World}}</ref> For the king, oil revenues became a crucial source of wealth since he no longer had to rely on receipts from pilgrimages to [[Mecca]]. This discovery would alter [[Middle East]]ern political relations forever.\n\n==Changes to the original concession==\nIn 1943, the name of the company in control in Saudi Arabia was changed to [[Arabian American Oil Company]] (ARAMCO). In addition, numerous changes were made to the original concession after the striking of oil. In 1939, the first modification gave the Arabian American Oil Company a greater area to search for oil and extended the concession until 1949, increasing the original deal by six years. In return, ARAMCO agreed to provide the Saudi Arabian government with large amounts of free [[kerosene]] and [[gasoline]], and to pay higher payments than originally stipulated.\n\nBeginning in 1950, the Saudi Arabian government began a pattern of trying to increase government shares of [[revenue]] from oil production. In 1950, a fifty-fifty [[Profit sharing|profit-sharing]] agreement was signed, whereby a tax was levied by the government. This tax considerably increased government revenues. The government continued this trend well into the \u201880s. By 1982, ARAMCO\u2019s concession area was reduced to 220,000 square kilometers, down from the original 930,000 square kilometers. By 1988, ARAMCO was officially bought out by Saudi Arabia and became known as [[Saudi Aramco]].\n\n==Tapline==\nDue to the quantity of the oil in Saudi Arabia, construction of [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s became necessary to increase efficiency of production and transport. ARAMCO soon realized that \u201cadvantages of a pipeline to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] seemed obvious, saving about 3,200 kilometers of sea travel and the transit fees of the [[Suez Canal]]\u201d.<ref name = EF>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/saudi-arabia/oil-industry.html|title=Saudi Arabia Oil Industry|work=country-studies.com}}</ref> In 1945, the [[Trans-Arabian Pipeline|Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline)]] was started and was completed in 1950. The pipeline greatly increased efficiency of oil transport, but also had its shortcomings. Issues concerning taxes and damages plagued it for years. It had to be shut down numerous times for repairs, and by 1983 was officially shut down.<ref name = EF/>\n\n==1973 Arab-Israeli War==\nThis conflict was also known as the [[Yom Kippur War]]. This was a conflict between [[Egypt]], [[Syria]]  and their backers versus [[Israel]]. The conflict was the continuation of a troubling historical pattern of conflict between Israel and the [[Arab world]].

Training took place in an old playground at Gashlat Al-Shortah west of Al-Fotah Garden where there was a small football field and a small room to store balls and shirts. In addition to Al-Ja'ba Brothers, Ali and Issa Al-Owais were among the first workers at the club.\n\nThe club operated as an amateur club until 1960 when it was registered officially with the General Presidency of Youth Welfare. It was at this time that [[Prince Abdulrahman Bin Saud]] became head of Al-Nassr. Al-Nassr started in the second division of the league. They were promoted to the first division in 1963. During the 1970s and 1980s, the club won eight [[Saudi Premier League]] titles, six [[King's Cup]]s, three [[Crown Prince Cup]]s and three [[Saudi Federation Cup|Federation Cup]]. The team's success was built around the \"Saudi Golden Trio\" of [[Majed Abdullah]], [[Fahd Al-Herafy]] and [[Mohaisn Al-Jam'aan]].\n[[File:Majed Abdullah in 1984.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Majed Abdullah|Majed Ahmed Abdullah]] is Al-Nassr's all-time leader in goals scored and appearances.]]\n\n===90s era (1989\u20132002)===\nIn the 1990s, Al-Nassr won two further [[Saudi Premier League]] titles, a King's Cup and a Federation Cup. They also had success in several international tournaments, winning two [[GCC Champions League]]s, one [[Asian Cup Winners' Cup]] and one [[Asian Super Cup]]. The club represented the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] region in the first [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in Brazil in 2000. In [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship|the competition]] Al-Nassr played against [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Raja Casablanca]], and finished 3rd in the group. Al-Nassr won the competition's Fair Play award.\n\n===Setbacks (2003\u20132007)===\nAfter the Golden Trio's retirement, Al-Nassr went into some major setbacks. In 2006\u201307, the club only avoided relegation on the last day of the season, which prompted honorary members of the club to begin an effective long-term plan, to revolutionize management and team members.\n\n===Return of The Global (2008\u2013present)===\nAfter a major overhaul of playing staff, Al-Nassr went on to win the Federation Cup 2008 against city rivals, [[Al-Hilal FC|Al Hilal]]. The club finished third in 2009\u201310 securing [[Asian Champions League]] football for the following season. In 2011\u201312, Al-Nassr saw itself on the King Cup's final, only to finish as a runners-up, and in 2012\u201313, Al-Nassr continued its steady steps into returning to the Saudi giant it once was, where it reached the Crown Prince Cup final, only to lose to Al-Hilal on penalties.\n\nIn 2013\u201314, Al-Nassr finally achieved its long-term goal of returning to crowning stages, by earning an impressive [[Double (association football)|double]] against city rivals Al-Hilal on both league and Crown Prince cups. The team subsequently qualified for the [[2015 AFC Champions League]] following the astonishing accomplishment.\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, Al-Nassr continued defending the title as holding champion, by winning the league, and reaching the King's Cup final, as well as qualifying for the Crown Prince's semi-final. The identity of a returning champion still persists within club halls.\n\n==Name, Logo and Colors==\n[[File:Al nassr logo.png|125px|logo|thumb|left|old crest]]\nAl-Nassr is the Arabic word for \"victory.\" Clubs with the same name are found in [[Oman]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[UAE]] and [[Libya]] but the Saudi Arabian club was the first to take the name.\n\nThe club's logo represents the map of Arabia with yellow and blue colors. Yellow for the gorgeous sand of the Arabian [[desert]]s, and blue for the magnificent water in the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Recently the old logo has been replaced by a \"more modern version,\" but still is heavily influenced by the old club logo. The new logo only represents the football team while the old logo represents the club as a whole.\n\n==Sponsorship==\nSince the start of the 2013/2014 season, Al-Nassr lacked any sponsors. Yet, still managed to pull through with a [[Double (association football)|double]], by winning the Crown Prince's cup, as well as finishing first in the SPL. In the 2014/2015 season, Al-Nassr managed to land on multiple sponsors, including electronic manufacturer UGINE, and telecom giants [[Mobily]] for a developing partnership that spans for 5 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rayan|first1=Abu|title=Coverage of Mobily partnership|url=http://www.nassr.com/showthread.php?t=152148|publisher=Nassr Official Media Center|accessdate=15 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214031017/http://www.nassr.com/showthread.php?t=152148|archive-date=14 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Al Otaibi|first1=Bandar|title=Al-Nassr and Mobily Sign a 5-Year Partnership|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/952848|publisher=Al Riyadh Newspaper|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Kit providers===\n* 2007\u201310: [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]]\n* 2010\u201312: [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]\n* 2012\u201317: Al-Nassr FC Official Merchandise Store\n* 2017\u20132018: [[New Balance]]\n* 2018\u2013 [[Sporta]]\n\n==Current squad==\n''As of 28 September 2019:''<ref>https://twitter.com/AlNassrFC/status/1034852535708905472</ref><ref>http://www.kooora.com/?team=146&cz=15887&mode=p</ref> <br />\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|No\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|Position\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|Player\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|Nation\n|-\n{{Fs player2 |no=1 |nat=AUS|name=[[Brad Jones (soccer)|Brad Jones]]     |pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=2 |nat=KSA|name=[[Sultan Al-Ghanam]]                   |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=3 |nat=KSA|name=[[Abdullah Madu]]                      |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=4 |nat=KSA|name=[[Omar Hawsawi]]                       |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=5 |nat=KSA|name=[[Abdulelah Al-Amri]]                  |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=6 |nat=BRA|name=[[Petros Matheus dos Santos Ara\u00fajo|Petros]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=7 |nat=NGR|name=[[Ahmed Musa]]                         |pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=8 |nat=KSA|name=[[Yahya Al-Shehri]]                    |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=9 |nat=MAR|name=[[Abderrazak Hamdallah]]               |pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=10|nat=BRA|name=[[Giuliano de Paula|Giuliano]]         |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=11|nat=MAR|name=[[Nordin Amrabat]]                     |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=13|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdulrahman Al-Obaid]]               |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=15|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdullaziz Al-Dawsari]]              |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=16|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdulaziz Al-Jebreen]]               |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=17|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdullah Al-Khaibari]]               |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=18|nat=BRA|name=[[Maicon Pereira Roque|Maicon]]        |pos=DF|other=on loan from [[Galatasaray S.K.

Training took place in an old playground at Gashlat Al-Shortah west of Al-Fotah Garden where there was a small football field and a small room to store balls and shirts. In addition to Al-Ja'ba Brothers, Ali and Issa Al-Owais were among the first workers at the club.\n\nThe club operated as an amateur club until 1960 when it was registered officially with the General Presidency of Youth Welfare. It was at this time that [[Prince Abdulrahman Bin Saud]] became head of Al-Nassr. Al-Nassr started in the second division of the league. They were promoted to the first division in 1963. During the 1970s and 1980s, the club won eight [[Saudi Premier League]] titles, six [[King's Cup]]s, three [[Crown Prince Cup]]s and three [[Saudi Federation Cup|Federation Cup]]. The team's success was built around the \"Saudi Golden Trio\" of [[Majed Abdullah]], [[Fahd Al-Herafy]] and [[Mohaisn Al-Jam'aan]].\n[[File:Majed Abdullah in 1984.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Majed Abdullah|Majed Ahmed Abdullah]] is Al-Nassr's all-time leader in goals scored and appearances.]]\n\n===90s era (1989\u20132002)===\nIn the 1990s, Al-Nassr won two further [[Saudi Premier League]] titles, a King's Cup and a Federation Cup. They also had success in several international tournaments, winning two [[GCC Champions League]]s, one [[Asian Cup Winners' Cup]] and one [[Asian Super Cup]]. The club represented the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] region in the first [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in Brazil in 2000. In [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship|the competition]] Al-Nassr played against [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Raja Casablanca]], and finished 3rd in the group. Al-Nassr won the competition's Fair Play award.\n\n===Setbacks (2003\u20132007)===\nAfter the Golden Trio's retirement, Al-Nassr went into some major setbacks. In 2006\u201307, the club only avoided relegation on the last day of the season, which prompted honorary members of the club to begin an effective long-term plan, to revolutionize management and team members.\n\n===Return of The Global (2008\u2013present)===\nAfter a major overhaul of playing staff, Al-Nassr went on to win the Federation Cup 2008 against city rivals, [[Al-Hilal FC|Al Hilal]]. The club finished third in 2009\u201310 securing [[Asian Champions League]] football for the following season. In 2011\u201312, Al-Nassr saw itself on the King Cup's final, only to finish as a runners-up, and in 2012\u201313, Al-Nassr continued its steady steps into returning to the Saudi giant it once was, where it reached the Crown Prince Cup final, only to lose to Al-Hilal on penalties.\n\nIn 2013\u201314, Al-Nassr finally achieved its long-term goal of returning to crowning stages, by earning an impressive [[Double (association football)|double]] against city rivals Al-Hilal on both league and Crown Prince cups. The team subsequently qualified for the [[2015 AFC Champions League]] following the astonishing accomplishment.\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, Al-Nassr continued defending the title as holding champion, by winning the league, and reaching the King's Cup final, as well as qualifying for the Crown Prince's semi-final. The identity of a returning champion still persists within club halls.\n\n==Name, Logo and Colors==\n[[File:Al nassr logo.png|125px|logo|thumb|left|old crest]]\nAl-Nassr is the Arabic word for \"victory.\" Clubs with the same name are found in [[Oman]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[UAE]] and [[Libya]] but the Saudi Arabian club was the first to take the name.\n\nThe club's logo represents the map of Arabia with yellow and blue colors. Yellow for the gorgeous sand of the Arabian [[desert]]s, and blue for the magnificent water in the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Recently the old logo has been replaced by a \"more modern version,\" but still is heavily influenced by the old club logo. The new logo only represents the football team while the old logo represents the club as a whole.\n\n==Sponsorship==\nSince the start of the 2013/2014 season, Al-Nassr lacked any sponsors. Yet, still managed to pull through with a [[Double (association football)|double]], by winning the Crown Prince's cup, as well as finishing first in the SPL. In the 2014/2015 season, Al-Nassr managed to land on multiple sponsors, including electronic manufacturer UGINE, and telecom giants [[Mobily]] for a developing partnership that spans for 5 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rayan|first1=Abu|title=Coverage of Mobily partnership|url=http://www.nassr.com/showthread.php?t=152148|publisher=Nassr Official Media Center|accessdate=15 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214031017/http://www.nassr.com/showthread.php?t=152148|archive-date=14 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Al Otaibi|first1=Bandar|title=Al-Nassr and Mobily Sign a 5-Year Partnership|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/952848|publisher=Al Riyadh Newspaper|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Kit providers===\n* 2007\u201310: [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]]\n* 2010\u201312: [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]\n* 2012\u201317: Al-Nassr FC Official Merchandise Store\n* 2017\u20132018: [[New Balance]]\n* 2018\u2013 [[Sporta]]\n\n==Current squad==\n''As of 28 September 2019:''<ref>https://twitter.com/AlNassrFC/status/1034852535708905472</ref><ref>http://www.kooora.com/?team=146&cz=15887&mode=p</ref> <br />\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|No\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|Position\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|Player\n! style=\"color:blue; background:yellow;\"|Nation\n|-\n{{Fs player2 |no=1 |nat=AUS|name=[[Brad Jones (soccer)|Brad Jones]]     |pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=2 |nat=KSA|name=[[Sultan Al-Ghanam]]                   |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=3 |nat=KSA|name=[[Abdullah Madu]]                      |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=4 |nat=KSA|name=[[Omar Hawsawi]]                       |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=5 |nat=KSA|name=[[Abdulelah Al-Amri]]                  |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=6 |nat=BRA|name=[[Petros Matheus dos Santos Ara\u00fajo|Petros]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=7 |nat=NGR|name=[[Ahmed Musa]]                         |pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=8 |nat=KSA|name=[[Yahya Al-Shehri]]                    |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=9 |nat=MAR|name=[[Abderrazak Hamdallah]]               |pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=10|nat=BRA|name=[[Giuliano de Paula|Giuliano]]         |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=11|nat=MAR|name=[[Nordin Amrabat]]                     |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=13|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdulrahman Al-Obaid]]               |pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=15|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdullaziz Al-Dawsari]]              |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=16|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdulaziz Al-Jebreen]]               |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=17|nat=KSA|name=[[Abdullah Al-Khaibari]]               |pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player2 |no=18|nat=BRA|name=[[Maicon Pereira Roque|Maicon]]        |pos=DF|other=on loan from [[Galatasaray S.K.

Nandini lives with Pallavi in her marital home with Pallavi's husband Gautam and his family - his mother Jayshree, and his sister Sumati. Sumati and Nandini are close friends but Jayshree considers Nandini a burden on the family and resents her.\n\nA marriage proposal for Sumati arrives from the Rajadhyaksha family. Prem Rajadhyaksha is the youngest son of Dr. Kalyani and comes to meet Sumati but on the way he bumps into Nandini and instantly falls in love with her. When he sees her again at the Karmarkars' home, he makes it clear that he wants to marry her. Eventually, everyone agrees and wedding preparations begin. On the day of their engagement, Nandini and Prem get arrested due to a misunderstanding and are bailed out by Govind's younger brother Krushna.\n\nOn their wedding day, Govind intercepts a letter meant for the Rajadhyaksha's saying that Nandini has a past and Prem should not marry her. The day after the wedding, Kalyani opens her front door to see someone has left a baby with a letter stating that the baby is Nandini's. Kalyani tries to keep the secret from everyone but when her mother-in-law and other daughter-in-law Urmila find out, Nandini agrees to undergo medical tests to prove the baby is not hers. The truth is confirmed but Kalyani discovers something else and discusses it with Gautam and Pallavi. They reveal that Nandini was raped at a family wedding and delivered a stillborn child but since she was in a coma after the incident, she has no memory of it. Kalyani decides to keep the truth to herself.\n\nOn her birthday, Nandini overhears Pallavi and Gautam discussing the incident and feels disgusted and betrayed, but she also feels that she has betrayed Prem. Kalyani makes Nandini promise her that she will keep this truth from Prem and the entire family and that she will maintain a distance from Prem. Prem's sister Prapti is getting engaged to Mayank and on the day of the ceremony, a series of events lead Nandini to recall the incident and that her rapist was Krushna. Krushna claims he loves her and brutally misbehaves with her, and continues to harass Nandini for many days warning her that her only option is to surrender herself to him or he will harm Prem. He creates misunderstandings between Nandini and Prem. Nandini decides to tell Prem the truth and confess her love for him by recording a message but Prem listens to half the message and rushes to Nandini. They embrace and consummate their marriage. \n\nWhen Prem hears the full message, he is shocked and blames Nandini for betraying. Kalyani defends Nandini and reminds everyone that it wasn't Nandini's fault that she was raped. The following day Prem realises that he was wrong but his father refuses to accept Nandini and forces her and Prem to leave the house. Prem struggles to find a job to support Nandini and himself, but finally accepts a job offer from Krushna, unaware of Krushna's truth. \n\nTired of Krushna's threats, Nandini makes him confess while Prem and Sonakshi, Krushna's wife, overhear the entire the conversation. Prem gets into a fight with Krushna and a blast occurs in which Krushna dies. Prem is arrested for Krushna's death. Nandini and Gautam struggle to find a lawyer to fight Prem's case and eventually Sumati steps in to fight the case against Sonakshi's lawyer who happens to be Sumati's law professor. Sumati and Nandini try to collect evidence to strengthen their case against Krushna, however all of their efforts are ruined because Jayshree sabotages their case wanting justice for Krushna. \n\nJayshree finds out that Krushna is alive and is now in hiding. Nandini is finally compelled to tell the court that Krushna raped her and made her life miserable. Nandini finds the doctor that treated her when she was raped but the doctor is bribed by Krushna and turns hostile in court. Kalyani is contacted by an anonymous caller saying that he has the evidence of Krushna being alive, so she and Nandini go to collect the evidence. Krushna finds out and tries to snatch the evidence from Kalyani. A struggle ensues and Kalyani falls to her death.\n\nDuring the next court hearing, Gautam stands in the witness box and claims that he was the one who raped Nandini and killed Krushna out of anger hoping that this will awaken Krushna's sleeping humanity. Krushna cannot endure the guilt and finally cracks. He surrenders himself admitting to all his crimes. Jayshree apologises to Nandini and gives her her blessings as does Prem's father.\n\nNandini returns to her in laws and the family becomes busy in preparing for Prapti's wedding. Prem is contacted by a ward boy who tells him that Nandini's child is in fact alive and living at an orphanage after he had switched the babies. They track down the girl called Mithoo at the orphanage. Nandini is unable to accept Mithoo because she is constantly reminded of the incident and that Mithoo is a part of Krushna. Prem wants to accept Mithoo and regards her as his daughter. Nandini finally accepts Mithoo and they all live happily ever after.\n\n==Other Versions/Telecasts==\nIt was dubbed in [[Arabic]] and aired on [[Zee Alwan]] as ''\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0629
