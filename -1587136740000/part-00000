He died in 882 and was succeeded in all his territories, which encompassed most of [[East Francia]], by his younger brother, [[Charles the Fat]], already [[king of Italy]] and [[Carolingian emperor|emperor]].\n\n==Military youth==\nAs a young man, Louis was deployed in military operations against the [[Abodrites]] to the east in 858 and 862.<ref>Reuter, 72.</ref> In 854, at the invitation of the nobles of [[Aquitaine]] opposed to [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]], and coaxed by his father and his cousin [[Charles, Archbishop of Mainz]], he crossed into Gaul at the head of an army, intent on receiving the Aquitainian crown. He marched as far as [[Limoges]] before turning back.\n\nBack home, Louis forged close ties with the nobles of East Francia and became increasingly independent from his father. He engaged himself to the daughter of Count Adalard and, in 865, he and his brother Charles joined in rebellion against their father. This flirtation with revolt was brief, however, and Louis, Charles, and their father were reconciled later that year, though the elder Louis was forced to make a division of the remainder of his territories between his two sons. Carloman had already been given the ''[[Subkingdom (Monarchy)|subregulus]]'' of [[Bavaria]] in 864, now Louis received [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Franconia]] and Charles [[Alemannia]] and [[Rhaetia]].\n\nIn 869, Louis married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard of Saxony]], daughter of [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony]], at [[Aschaffenburg]]. Liutgard was a strong-willed and politically ambitious woman and later on spurred her husband to pursue ambitious goals. This match increased tensions between father and son and in 871 and in 873, Louis rebelled, but, on each occasion, he later reconciled with his father.\n\n==Rule in Saxony==\nUpon his father's death in 876, Louis fully inherited his subkingdoms, bearing the title ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German and as his father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of [[Lorsch]], in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, [[Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz|Liutbert]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.\n\n===Acquisition of Lotharingia and Bavaria===\nLouis's rule was immediately threatened by Charles the Bald, who tried to annex the eastern parts of [[Lotharingia]] and maybe even to achieve supremacy over his nephew. Louis brought war on Charles and, on 8 October 876 at [[Andernach]], he defeated the much-larger host of West Francia. The East Frankish army displayed superiority in both unity and tactics, and the young king had even dressed his soldiers in white garments so that they appeared as an army of spirits.\n\nAfter this victory, Louis the German's three sons met in November at [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] to discuss the division of their father's kingdom and to have their hosts swear allegiance. According to the plan drawn up in 865, which their father, despite all his sons' rebellions, had confirmed in 872, Carloman received Bavaria, Charles Swabia, and Louis Saxony, Franconia, and Thuringia. Throughout his reign, though he is always called \"King of Saxony\" by historians, he never visited Saxony proper, though it formed the bulk of his territory. At the end of 877, the brothers assembled again to discuss the administration of their half of Lotharingia. After Carloman relinquished his claim, the realm was divided between Louis and Charles, who again met in September 878 in [[Alsace|Alsatia]]. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and named Louis as his successor (and erstwhile regent) in Bavaria. Louis received it outright a year later when Carloman expired.\n\nIn November 878 after the death of Charles the Bald, his heir, [[Louis the Stammerer]], and the latter's cousin Louis the Younger promised each other to respect the succession of their respective sons and to issue no claims contrary to that, at [[Voeren]] (''Fourons'' in [[French language|French]]). This Treaty of Fouron was soon put to the test, when Louis the Stammerer died in April 879. A party of western nobles led by [[Abbot Joscelin]] invited Louis the Younger to succeed to the rule of the western kingdom. Since his wife Liutgard also advocated heeding this call, Louis invaded West Francia. He marched as far as [[Verdun]], but after the new kings [[Louis III of France|Louis III]] and [[Carloman of France|Carloman]] ceded their part of [[Lotharingia]] to the invader, Louis retreated. In February 880, this gain was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], signed near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint Quentin]]. This treaty determined the border of the two kingdoms, which was to remain unchanged until the fourteenth century.\n\n===Relationship with the nobility===\nIn contrast to his father, Louis the Younger preferred reconciling royal interests with those of the nobility and avoided confrontation. He managed to bind powerful families to the king, including the [[Ottonian|Luidovingian]] relatives of his wife, that later themselves became kings and emperors. Louis mostly stayed in the [[Rhineland]], avoiding Saxony or his eastern borders. Louis did visit Bavaria on two occasions, but mostly left it to the government of his illegitimate nephew, Carloman's son, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], [[Duke of Carinthia]].<ref>As \"prefect of the marches.\" Bowlus, 569.</ref>\n\n===Viking incursions===\nSince the summer of 879, [[Vikings]] had been increasing their attacks on the Frankish kingdom and occasionally penetrated deeply into the interior of the land. Louis's kingdom was the most hard-hit after that of West Francia. In February 880, Louis confronted and defeated a [[Norsemen|Norse]] host at the [[Battle of Thimeon]] (near modern [[Charleroi]]).{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} His son Hugh, however, was killed in this battle.{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} The next year, Louis defeated the [[Norsemen|Norse]] again at the [[Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu|battle of Saucourt]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=235}} Louis also drove the Norse out of the royal palace of [[Nijmegen]], which they had occupied. In the same month, a Saxon host commanded by [[Brun, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bruno]], the king's brother-in-law, suffered a heavy defeat near [[Hamburg]] and Bruno and many other Saxon nobles fell.\n\n==Death and succession==\nLouis fell sick in 881 and died in [[Frankfurt]] on 20 January 882. He was buried beside his father in the abbey of Lorsch. By his wife Luitgard of Saxony, he had had a son called Louis (877&ndash;879), who died in a fall from a palace window, and a daughter called Hildegard (878&ndash;895). Louis had also fathered an illegitimate son, Hugh (855/60 \u2013 February 880), either with the daughter of Adalard or with an earlier concubine. Since he left no heir, all his territories fell to his brother Charles, who thus could reunite the entire East Frankish kingdom. Hildegard later joined with the Bavarian magnate [[Engeldeo]] in conspiring against [[Arnulf of Carinthia|King Arnulf]] and was deprived of her \"public honours\" in 895, according to the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]''.\n\n== Family ==\nLouis the Younger married Liutgard, a daughter of Duke [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony|Liudolf of Saxony]], Liudolf of Saxony was grandfather of King [[Henry I of Germany]].\n\n* [[Louis of Saxony|Louis]] (876 - November 879)\n* Hildegard (875/878 or 881 - after ca.900)\n* Bernhart\n\nHis illegitimate children were:\n* [[Hugo (Son of Louis the Younger)|Hugo]] (ca. 855/860 - February 880), illegitimate son{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}}\n* Adalhard, illegitimate son\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kings of Germany family tree]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Charles Oman|Oman, Charles]].

Afterwards, Judy wrote a short story: A young orphan named Jerusha (in the original novel, this was Judy's real name.  She changed it to 'Judy' when she went to college) was caught taking a biscuits from the biscuit tray by the matron of the orphanage.  As a punishment, she was sent to her room with no food.  One night, she tried to escape but the matron caught her and for that, she was tied to a tree.  Then, a young boy came and freed her.  They ran to the forest with the matron and some hired help out looking for them.  They nearly got caught and the two decided to part ways to elude the search party.  Years later, Jerusha was working in a cornfield and on her way back to the farm, a car stopped beside her and out came a man who called her name.  She did not initially recognize the stranger until it dawned to her that this was the owner of the farm she's working in and also the boy who rescued her from the orphanage.  \nUpon reading the story, Sally and Julia (although, she tried to hide it) were deeply touched and wept.\nWhen the competition ended, the poster showed that there were no clear winners but Judy won a commemoration fountain pen as a prize which she gladly accepted.\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u5c0f\u8aac\u304c\u76d7\u4f5c\uff1f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|5|20|df=y}}|\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = A hot dog and a wallflower\n| ShortSummary        = The dance ball at the Lincoln Memorial High School was coming and many of the girls are inviting their male companions to dance with them.  Julia said that the girl who doesn't have a partner is called a wallflower and although Judy is actually worried of becoming one, she decided that if she'll become one, she might as well be the most beautiful wallflower.\nWhen she accompanied Julia on a shopping trip, they went to a small diner called \"Presence of Mind\" at Judy's suggestion, for some a meal.  There, they were greeted by a very affable, tall, and dark haired waiter.  At his suggestion, Judy ordered some hotdogs and with reluctance, so did Julia.  His cheerful and irreproachable personality endeared him to Judy but not so with Julia, who took into openly disliking him.  During the ball, Julia, Judy, and Sally were the only ones standing in the corner.  Sallie went to look for her dance partner who seemed to be wandering somewhere while Julia decided to have a drink and as she was getting a drink, she bumped into a man and to her surprise, it was the affable waiter, who was busy stuffing himself with hotdogs.  The waiter tried to apologise to Julia but she snubbed him.  He was however, glad to see Judy and asked her for a dance.

The two went out fishing and camping but got caught out in the thunderstorm.  In their hasty effort to get back to the farm, Judy slipped and fell into the ravine.  Eventually, Jervis found her and held her in his arms.\nThe day of his departure, he thanked everyone for his time in the farm and surprised Judy by planting a kiss on her cheek.\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u590f\u306e\u65e5\u306e\u604b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|9|23|df=y}}|\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 31\n| Title               = Girls in Full Bloom\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u82b1\u3056\u304b\u308a\u306e\u5a18\u305f\u3061\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|9|30|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 32\n| Title               = A Twilight Meeting at the Station\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u9ec4\u660f\u306e\u99c5\u306b\u3066\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|10|21|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 33\n| Title               = Feelings That Just Miss Each Other\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u3059\u308c\u3061\u304c\u3046\u60f3\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|11|4|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 34\n| Title               = he Throbbing of My Heart\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u3053\u306e\u80f8\u306e\u3068\u304d\u3081\u304d\u3092\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|11|11|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 35\n| Title               = Loneliness in Youth\n| ShortSummary        = Sally was excited when Bob asked to take her out for a drive.  Judy was also excited because tomorrow is Jervis' birthday and thought of giving him a present.  They both asked Julia to go out shopping with them but Julia refused saying that she wanted to study.  At the library, Julia couldn't concentrate on her studies and took out instead a book about American football.\nUpon arriving at Ferguson dormitory, Julia received a phone call from her mother.  Mrs. Pendleton told her that she has arranged a dinner party for Julia and introduce her to the son of a New York real estate agent.  Julia adamantly refused and said that she's in love with Jimmy McBride but her mother wouldn't hear of it.  In anger, Julia slammed the phone down and went to her room.  When Sally and Judy arrived later, they showed her the hat that Sallie bought for her intended date with Bob and Judy showed a handkerchief with initials \"JP\" embroidered on it as a present for Jervis.  Julia initially wanted to tell them something but hesitated and announced to the girls that she's taking a walk for a while which puzzled Sally and Judy. Back in Princeton, Bob interrupted the football team's practice by telling Jimmy that he had a phone call.  When Jimmy picked out the phone, it was from Julia. While Sally and Judy were asleep, Julia packed her favourite clothes and suitcase and slipped out of the dormitory. The following day, Mrs. Pendleton arrived with the intention of taking Julia out and bring her back to New York with her but Ms. Throne told her that she would have to follow the procedures and fill out the forms before taking Julia out of the dorm. The commotion this caused woke Judy up from her sleep.  She roused Sallie from slumber and they both found that Julia's bed was empty. Mrs. Pendleton managed to force herself into the girls' room.  When Ms. Throne, who overheard Julia's phone conversation with her mother, told Judy about the conversation, Judy came to conclusion that this might be the reason why Julia was acting strangely. While Mrs. Pendleton and Ms Sloan are in Sally and Julia's room, Judy took Sally to her room and told her that Julia might have run away.  She asked Sally to distract Mrs. Pendleton and Ms. Throne so she can slip off and go look for Julia.\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u5b64\u72ec\u306a\u9752\u6625\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|11|18|df=y}}|\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = In Order to Seize the Day\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u4eca\u3092\u751f\u304d\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|11|25|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 37\n| Title               = A Farewell on Christmas Eve\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u8056\u591c\u306e\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|12|2|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 38\n| Title               = A Sad Proposal\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u60b2\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|12|9|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 39\n| Title               = Graduating from the Past\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u904e\u53bb\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5352\u696d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|12|16|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 40\n| Title               = Nice to Meet You, Daddy!\n| ShortSummary        = On her graduation day, Mr. Griggs rushed to tell Judy that her father, John Smith, was terribly ill.

Suddenly caught in a traffic jam, Judy asked Mr. Griggs to draw a map and she ran towards the home of Mr. Smith despite the heavily pouring rain. After running into a parade and getting lost, she finally ended up at the home of John Smith where she has discovered that he was actually her lover, Jervis.\nJervis at that time was suffering from pneumonia and his health was deteriorating quickly. This is where he told Judy that he liked the initial entry she had for the scholarship, which he found interesting and quirky, so he decided to choose her for a scholarship. He has fallen in love with the Judy in the letters who seemed so carefree and he was deeply hurt when she had rejected him.\n\nAfter confessing his feelings and identity to Judy, he suddenly fainted and a doctor came in to tend to him.\n\nSleeping by his bedside, Judy held his hand till morning. Jervis woke up and was cured of pneumonia.\n\nLater he married Judy at the small church in Lock Willow Farm. It is shown that Julia was engaged to Jimmy Mcbride, to be married once he completes his master's degree. Sallie and Bob remained good friends.\n\nJudy decided to go to college to achieve her dreams, while being a good wife to Jervis.\n\nIn the end, she wrote a final letter to Daddy Long Legs signed Pendelton-Smith, Judy Abbott.\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066\u304a\u3058\u3055\u307e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|12|23|df=y}}|\n}}\n|}\n\n==Music==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At Sally's suggestion, Judy showed it to Mr. Melnore.  To her dismay, Mr. Melnore told her that by the style of her story, one could tell her favorite authors\u2014which is equivalent to plagiarising their work.  Afterwards, Judy wrote a short story: A young orphan named Jerusha (in the original novel, this was Judy's real name.  She changed it to 'Judy' when she went to college) was caught taking a biscuits from the biscuit tray by the matron of the orphanage.  As a punishment, she was sent to her room with no food.  One night, she tried to escape but the matron caught her and for that, she was tied to a tree.  Then, a young boy came and freed her.  They ran to the forest with the matron and some hired help out looking for them.  They nearly got caught and the two decided to part ways to elude the search party.  Years later, Jerusha was working in a cornfield and on her way back to the farm, a car stopped beside her and out came a man who called her name.  She did not initially recognize the stranger until it dawned to her that this was the owner of the farm she's working in and also the boy who rescued her from the orphanage.  \nUpon reading the story, Sally and Julia (although, she tried to hide it) were deeply touched and wept.\nWhen the competition ended, the poster showed that there were no clear winners but Judy won a commemoration fountain pen as a prize which she gladly accepted.\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u5c0f\u8aac\u304c\u76d7\u4f5c\uff1f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|5|20|df=y}}|\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = A hot dog and a wallflower\n| ShortSummary        = The dance ball at the Lincoln Memorial High School was coming and many of the girls are inviting their male companions to dance with them.  Julia said that the girl who doesn't have a partner is called a wallflower and although Judy is actually worried of becoming one, she decided that if she'll become one, she might as well be the most beautiful wallflower.\nWhen she accompanied Julia on a shopping trip, they went to a small diner called \"Presence of Mind\" at Judy's suggestion, for some a meal.  There, they were greeted by a very affable, tall, and dark haired waiter.  At his suggestion, Judy ordered some hotdogs and with reluctance, so did Julia.  His cheerful and irreproachable personality endeared him to Judy but not so with Julia, who took into openly disliking him.  During the ball, Julia, Judy, and Sally were the only ones standing in the corner.  Sallie went to look for her dance partner who seemed to be wandering somewhere while Julia decided to have a drink and as she was getting a drink, she bumped into a man and to her surprise, it was the affable waiter, who was busy stuffing himself with hotdogs.  The waiter tried to apologise to Julia but she snubbed him.  He was however, glad to see Judy and asked her for a dance.  It turned out that the waiter was Jimmie McBride, Sally's brother and to Julia's annoyance and surprise, is also the star quarterback of Princeton University football team.\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30c9\u30c3\u30b0\u3068\u58c1\u306e\u82b1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|5|27|df=y}}|\n\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = A Present from a Quarterback\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u30af\u30a9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|6|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 17\n| Title               = Unconfessable Heart\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u6253\u3061\u3042\u3051\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u5fc3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|6|10|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 18\n| Title               = A Thanksgiving Dinner Invitation\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u611f\u8b1d\u796d\u3078\u306e\u62db\u5f85\u72b6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|6|17|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 19\n| Title               = My Friends, Let's Sing Together\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u53cb\u3088\u3001\u3068\u3082\u306b\u6b4c\u308f\u3093\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|6|24|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 20\n| Title               = An Older Classmate\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u5e74\u4e0a\u306e\u540c\u7d1a\u751f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|7|1|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 21\n| Title               = Beauty and Sadness\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3068\u304b\u306a\u3057\u307f\u3068\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|7|8|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 22\n| Title               = Snow falling on the Window\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u7a93\u306b\u964d\u308b\u96ea\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|7|29|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| Title               = Our Different Christmases\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|8|5|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 24\n| Title               = As You Like It\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u304a\u6c17\u306b\u53ec\u3059\u307e\u307e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|8|12|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 25\n| Title               = New York, My Birthplace\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|8|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 26\n| Title               = A Bridge to Tomorrow\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u660e\u65e5\u306b\u67b6\u3051\u308b\u6a4b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|8|26|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 27\n| Title               = Being a Tutor is no Easy Task\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u5bb6\u5ead\u6559\u5e2b\u306f\u697d\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|9|2|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 28\n| Title               = A Ruthless Order\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u7121\u6148\u60b2\u306a\u547d\u4ee4\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|9|9|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 29\n| Title               = Full of Memories\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u304c\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|9|16|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 30\n| Title               = Love on a Summer Day\n| ShortSummary        = Judy was back in Lock Willow farm.

Judy was also excited because tomorrow is Jervis' birthday and thought of giving him a present.  They both asked Julia to go out shopping with them but Julia refused saying that she wanted to study.  At the library, Julia couldn't concentrate on her studies and took out instead a book about American football.\nUpon arriving at Ferguson dormitory, Julia received a phone call from her mother.  Mrs. Pendleton told her that she has arranged a dinner party for Julia and introduce her to the son of a New York real estate agent.  Julia adamantly refused and said that she's in love with Jimmy McBride but her mother wouldn't hear of it.  In anger, Julia slammed the phone down and went to her room.  When Sally and Judy arrived later, they showed her the hat that Sallie bought for her intended date with Bob and Judy showed a handkerchief with initials \"JP\" embroidered on it as a present for Jervis.  Julia initially wanted to tell them something but hesitated and announced to the girls that she's taking a walk for a while which puzzled Sally and Judy. Back in Princeton, Bob interrupted the football team's practice by telling Jimmy that he had a phone call.  When Jimmy picked out the phone, it was from Julia. While Sally and Judy were asleep, Julia packed her favourite clothes and suitcase and slipped out of the dormitory. The following day, Mrs. Pendleton arrived with the intention of taking Julia out and bring her back to New York with her but Ms. Throne told her that she would have to follow the procedures and fill out the forms before taking Julia out of the dorm. The commotion this caused woke Judy up from her sleep.  She roused Sallie from slumber and they both found that Julia's bed was empty. Mrs. Pendleton managed to force herself into the girls' room.  When Ms. Throne, who overheard Julia's phone conversation with her mother, told Judy about the conversation, Judy came to conclusion that this might be the reason why Julia was acting strangely. While Mrs. Pendleton and Ms Sloan are in Sally and Julia's room, Judy took Sally to her room and told her that Julia might have run away.

Working in [[pastel]]s on illustration board, she created most of the covers for ''Weird Tales'' between 1933 and 1938.\n\n==Early life==\nBrundage was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], of Swedish and Irish ancestry. Her father, Jonathan E. Loutitt (later Loutit) died when she was eight years old; she was raised by her mother (Margaret Jane Loutit Johnson) and grandmother Margaret (Houston) Loutit, for whom she was named, in a [[Christian Science]] household.<ref name=\"Everts\"/> Both her parents had come to Chicago from the [[Orkney Islands]] off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Brundage's mother remained both a widow and a devout Christian Scientist for the rest of her life, and supplemented their income by instructing beginning Christian Science disciples.<ref name=\"Everts\"/>\n\nMargaret Hedda Johnson graduated from Girard Grammar School and attended [[McKinley High School (Chicago)|McKinley High School]] in Chicago, where [[Walt Disney]] was a classmate. (\"I finished; he didn't,\" she later remarked.) She graduated from McKinley in 1919. As editor of the high school newspaper, Margaret Johnson was able to tell Walt Disney whether or not she would include any of his drawings in the McKinley newspaper.<ref name=\"Everts\"/>  Immediately after high school, Margaret worked providing illustrations for Chicago newspapers - she would draw fashion designs in both colour and in black-and-white, from ideas and descriptions provided by an agency.<ref name=\"Everts\"/>  Her education continued at the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]], 1921&ndash;23, (where Disney once again was her classmate); she later stated that her failure to graduate was due to her inept lettering though she continued her freelance work for the agency while she completed her coursework.  During this period \u2013 Prohibition \u2013 Margaret also worked at the Dill Pickle Club, a bohemian speakeasy affiliated with the [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobblies]], where she met a sometime decorator and house painter nicknamed \"Slim\"  due to his spare frame.  This was Myron Reed Brundage, a notorious womaniser.<ref name=\"Everts\">R. Alain Everts, \"Margaret Brundage\", ''Etching & Odysseys'' 2 (53-61), 1983.</ref>\n\nIn 1927, she married [[Slim Brundage|Myron \"Slim\" Brundage]] in Chicago. Brundage was a former hobo, a man with tendencies toward radical politics and alcohol; they had one child, a son, Kerlyn Byrd Brundage (born 27 August 1927; died 1972), always called \"Byrd\".<ref name=\"Everts\"/> The marriage ended in divorce in 1939.\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:Weird Tales May 1934.jpg|thumb|right|In ''[[Weird Tales]]'', Brundage illustrates [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Queen of the Black Coast]]'', a story about [[Conan the Barbarian]].]]\n\nIn 1932 Brundage was looking for more work, and found herself at the office of Farnsworth Wright, then editor of Weird Tales. Brundage began working for Wright by doing a few covers for his side publication ''[[Oriental Stories]]'', later known as ''The Magic Carpet''. Wright was so impressed with these that he hired Brundage to draw for Weird Tales. Over the period from 1933 to 1938, Brundage executed cover art, first for then, famously, for ''Weird Tales''. She was the most frequently-appearing cover artist on ''Weird Tales'' during her stint with the magazine. Her first cover appeared on the September 1932 issue; she created covers for 39 straight issues from June 1933 to August 1936. Her last original cover was for the Jan. 1945 issue, for a total of 66 original-artwork covers. (The total of 67, often cited in sources, includes a repeat of that final 1945 cover on the November 1953 issue.) She was paid $90 per cover\u2014enough to support herself, her son, and her invalid mother (died 1940) in years when her husband contributed nothing to the family's survival. From 1936 through 1938, Brundage often alternated with others as cover artist; [[Virgil Finlay]] was her chief competitor.\n\nBrundage's art frequently featured [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]] in various states of full or partial nudity; her whipping scenes were especially noteworthy and controversial. Her sensual images usually illustrated scenes from the pieces chosen by editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] as cover stories; her work was so popular among readers that some ''WT'' writers, like [[Seabury Quinn]], cannily included scenes in their stories that would make good Brundage covers, since cover feature stories earned their authors more money.\n\nPulp covers were notorious for their explicit content, and Brundage's were no exception. Since she signed her work \"M. Brundage\", many of the magazine's readers were unaware that the artist was female. (Complaints about the erotic nature of her work increased after October 1934, when editor Wright revealed that the \"M.\" stood for \"Margaret,\" that the artist was a woman.)  After 1938, when the magazine's editorial offices moved from Chicago to New York City, a new 'decency' standard was imposed (primarily through the efforts of then-mayor of New York [[Fiorello La Guardia]]) on pulp magazines sold at newsstands, and the nude or semi-nude young women that had been the primary subjects of Brundage's covers were out. Practical problems with shipping Brundage's fragile pastel art from Chicago to New York also diminished her appeal to the editorial regime that followed Wright's 1940 departure.\n\nShe continued to draw after her relationship with the magazine ended, and appeared at a number of [[science fiction conventions]] and art fairs, where some of her original period works were stolen. Yet she never fully recovered financially from the loss of regular work at ''WT;'' her later years were spent in relative poverty. She continued to work until her death.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Oriental Stories Spring 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Brundage also did illustrations for ''[[Oriental Stories]]'' in the early 1930s.]]\n[[L. Sprague de Camp]] is often quoted as claiming she used her daughters as models, but Brundage had no daughters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} De Camp himself debunked the claim at one point, writing \"About Margaret Brundage's luscious babes on the covers of ''Weird Tales'', a rumor was once rife that Mrs. Brundage used her two daughters as models.

In December 1933 he wrote to [[H. P. Lovecraft]]: \"The current W.T. design, though pleasing enough in color, is curiously suggestive of a Christmas card! [...] Mrs. Brundage [...] has about as much genuine feeling for the weird as a Jersey cow is likely to possess. The best angles in this picture (the hands of the Chinaman, etc) seem to have been swiped by unconscious cerebration from Utpatel's drawing for 'The Star-Spawn' by Derleth and Schorer.\" On September 9, 1937, he wrote to [[R. H. Barlow]]: \"Query: why does Brundage try to make all her women look like wet-nurses? It's a funny, not to say tiresome, complex.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Stephen D.

The [[Konami Code]], a type of [[cheat code]], became an intentional Easter egg in most games, but originated from Konami's ''[[Gradius]]'' (1985) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The programmer, [[Kazuhisa Hashimoto]], created the code as a means to rapidly [[debug]] the game by giving the player's avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game.

For example, [[Cartridge tilting|hitting the side]] of the ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996) cartridge while it was slotted in the console would bring the game back to the Level Select screen, which Burton explained was the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error, such as when connectivity between the cartridge and the console's microprocessor was temporarily lost.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=How hitting a game cartridge unlocks gaming's weirdest Easter egg|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/smack-cartridge-for-level-select-behind-gamings-weirdest-easter-egg/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=4 October 2017|language=en-us|date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In computing==\n===Software===\n[[File:Google Maps \"Mordor\" easter egg.png|thumb|Asking Google Maps for walking directions between fictional locations from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' produced this \"Easter egg\" response, quoting a character's warning from the story.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagstaff|first1=Keith|title=Google Maps Easter Egg: 'One Does Not Simply Walk Into Mordor'|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/12/21/google-maps-easter-egg-one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor/|website=Time|access-date=4 November 2017|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nIn [[computer software]], Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands.

At the time, [[Atari Corporation|Atari]] did not include programmers' names in the game credits, fearing that competitors would attempt to steal their employees. Robinett, who disagreed with his supervisor over this lack of acknowledgment, secretly programmed the message \"Created by Warren Robinett\" to appear only if a player moved their [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] over a specific pixel (dubbed the \"Gray Dot\") during a certain part of the game and entered a previously \"forbidden\" part of the map where the message would be found. When Robinett left Atari, he did not inform the company of the acknowledgment that he included in the game. Shortly after his departure, the \"Gray Dot\" and his message were discovered by a player. Atari's management initially wanted to remove the message and release the game again until this was deemed too costly. Instead, Steve Wright, the Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, suggested that they keep the message and, in fact, encourage the inclusion of such messages in future games, describing them as Easter eggs for consumers to find.<ref>{{cite web|title=Play Atari Adventure|url=http://my.ign.com/atari/adventure|website=IGN|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|title=How One Man Invented the Console Adventure Game|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/warren-robinett-adventure/|website=WIRED|access-date=2 September 2016|date=13 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Salen|first1=Katie|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Eric|title=The Game Design Reader: A Rules of Play Anthology|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262195364|pages=690\u2013713|oclc=58919795}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Letter to Atari|url=http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf|website=2600 Connections|publisher=Wayback Machine|access-date=September 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013192403/http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2016|date=August 4, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/technology/easter-eggs-tesla-google.html|title=The Secret History of 'Easter Eggs'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 8, 2019|last=Pogue|first=David|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In video games==\nWhile Robinett's message in ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' led to the use of the phrase Easter egg, Easter eggs were included in previous video games.

Fries described it as \"the earliest arcade game yet known that clearly meets the definition of an Easter egg\".

''[[Anti-Aircraft (video game)|Anti-Aircraft II]]'' (1975) included a means to modify the circuit board to make the airplanes in the game appear as alien UFOs. Fries surmised that this feature may have been intended for a Kee Games release. For this reason, and because it required a hardware modification, Fries questioned whether it met the definition of an Easter egg.<ref name=\"Fries\"/>\n\nSince ''Adventure'', there has been a long history of video game developers placing Easter eggs in their games.<ref name=\"Consalvo\">{{cite book|last1=Consalvo|first1=Mia|title=Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Videogames|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262033657}}</ref>{{rp|19}} Most Easter eggs are intentional - an attempt to communicate with the player or a way of getting even with management for a slight. Easter eggs in video games have taken a variety of forms, from purely ornamental screens to aesthetic enhancements that change some element of the game during play. The Easter egg included in the original ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' (1997) is an example of the latter; [[catapult]] projectiles are changed from stones to cows.<ref name=\"Consalvo\"/>{{rp|19}} \n\nMore elaborate Easter eggs include [[Level (video gaming)#Secret levels|secret levels]] and developers' rooms - fully functional, hidden areas of the game. Developers' rooms often include inside jokes from the [[fandom]] or development team and differ from a [[debug menu|debug room]] in that they are specifically intended for the player to find. Some games even include hidden [[minigame]]s as Easter eggs. In the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' (1993), the original ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' (1987) game can be played in its full version by using a home computer in a character's room.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rk\">{{cite book|last1=Bj\u00f6rk|first1=Staffan|last2=Holopainen|first2=Jussi|title=Patterns In Game Design|date=2005|publisher=Charles River Media|location=Hingham, Massachusetts|isbn=9781584503545|page=235|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFQfyODK4wAC&pg=PA235#v=onepage|access-date=25 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Optical Information Systems Update/library & Information Center Applications|journal=CD-ROM World|date=February 1994|volume=9|issue=1\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwoQAQAAMAAJ&q=Day+of+the+Tentacle+easter+egg&dq=Day+of+the+Tentacle+easter+egg|access-date=4 November 2017|publisher=Meckler Publishing|language=en|quote=The best Easter egg of all is the entire Maniac Mansion game, which appears on a computer in Doctor Fred's mansion.

The [[Konami Code]], a type of [[cheat code]], became an intentional Easter egg in most games, but originated from Konami's ''[[Gradius]]'' (1985) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The programmer, [[Kazuhisa Hashimoto]], created the code as a means to rapidly [[debug]] the game by giving the player's avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game. These types of codes are normally removed from the game before it is shipped but, in the case of ''Gradius'', Hashimoto forgot to remove it and the code was soon discovered by players. Its popularity inspired Konami to reuse the code and purposely retain it for many of its future games as an Easter egg.<ref name=\"Wolf\"/><ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rk\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Garmon|first1=Jay|title=Geek Trivia: The cheat goes on|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/geek-trivia-the-cheat-goes-on/|website=TechRepublic|access-date=16 April 2008|language=en|date=5 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nTechnical issues may also create unintentional Easter eggs. [[Jon Burton]], founder of [[Traveller's Tales]], announced that many seemingly apparent Easter eggs in their [[Sega Genesis]] games came about as a result of introducing programming tricks to get around some of the difficulty they had in getting Sega's strict certification for their games, [[Exception handling|catching any exceptions during execution]] to bring the game back to a usable state as to pass certification. For example, [[Cartridge tilting|hitting the side]] of the ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996) cartridge while it was slotted in the console would bring the game back to the Level Select screen, which Burton explained was the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error, such as when connectivity between the cartridge and the console's microprocessor was temporarily lost.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=How hitting a game cartridge unlocks gaming's weirdest Easter egg|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/smack-cartridge-for-level-select-behind-gamings-weirdest-easter-egg/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=4 October 2017|language=en-us|date=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In computing==\n===Software===\n[[File:Google Maps \"Mordor\" easter egg.png|thumb|Asking Google Maps for walking directions between fictional locations from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' produced this \"Easter egg\" response, quoting a character's warning from the story.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagstaff|first1=Keith|title=Google Maps Easter Egg: 'One Does Not Simply Walk Into Mordor'|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/12/21/google-maps-easter-egg-one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor/|website=Time|access-date=4 November 2017|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nIn [[computer software]], Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands.
