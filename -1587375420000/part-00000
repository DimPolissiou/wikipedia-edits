Ramu\u2019s father Mr. Gupta, a factory worker dies in an accident. When the factory refuses to pay compensation, his mother passes out in shock by falling from the stairs. Ramu is injured in an accident and he becomes crippled. Thrown out of his home, crippled and penniless, he roams around the streets of Mumbai. Here he comes across Mohan, a boy who is blind and has a similar tale of woe. Mohan comes from a village. His sister, Meena had migrated from the village to Mumbai to find work as a nurse so that she could pay for her brother\u2019s treatment. Mohan left the village after his caretaker died.\n\nRamu is good at playing the harmonica, while Mohan is a good singer. They team up and sing songs on the roadside and start earning money from passers-by. Ramu wants to finish his studies, and both of them befriend a small girl, Manjula (Baby Farida), who is the sister of a rich man, Ashok (Sanjay Khan). Manjula suffers from rheumatic Heart Disease and both the boys hope she would help them out.\n\nRamu and Mohan visit Manjula and ask for a loan of sixty rupees which is the amount required for Ramu's admission in school. But Manjula's brother rebuffs them and gives only five rupees. Feeling insulted, Mohan decides that he will raise the money by singing, which he successfully does. Ramu is admitted in the school after performing brilliantly in entrance test (he scores 294 out of 300). They move to a new house in a slum after someone tries to steal their hard earned money while they were sleeping on the footpath. Their new neighbor is Mausi, who lives with her teenage daughter and school going son, Nandu. Mausi treats them as her own sons.\n\nIn school, Ramu excels in studies despite being a regular target of ridicule of richer students who do not consider him their equal and often degrade him for being a \"street beggar\". The headmaster and teacher Sharma ji takes Ramu under their wings. Sharma ji also declared himself the guardian of Ramu. During a visit to Ramu's house, Sharmaji notices that the neighborhood is not fit for study and suggests that Ramu move in with him but Ramu does not leave Mohan. Meanwhile, one day while singing, Mohan hears someone (Ashok) calling out to Meena and rushes to embrace his long lost sister. But Meena is ashamed that Mohan has become a beggar and refuses to recognize him. Meena is looking after Manjula and there is a budding romance between her and Ashok. However, soon Meena confesses to Ashok. Ashok is sorry for her and consoles her that soon she will be together with her brother.\n\nMohan senses Manjula while sleeping and tells Ramu about it. Both decide to go and meet her, but she died. Ashok brings Mohan home one day and gives him Manjula's chime as her remembrance. When he tries to tell Mohan about Meena, Mohan lashes out in rage and says that he considers himself alone in this world, save for his friend Ramu.\n\nSoon after, Ramu gets in trouble with some ruffians and as a result is mistakenly arrested by police during a burglary. Sharma ji goes to police station and bails out Ramu on the condition that he will live with Sharma ji and keep no contact with Mohan. Mohan is heartbroken and decides to visit him. But Sharma ji didn't allow him to talk to Mohan. Sad, Mohan roams the streets singing sad songs.\n\nSharmaji suddenly dies, leaving Ramu shattered. Ramu decides not to appear for the final exam as he cannot pay the fees. Hearing this, Mohan decides to raise the money once again by singing in streets in spite of his ill health. He successfully earns the money and pays the fees without Ramu knowing, but himself falls prey to illness and is admitted in hospital. In hospital, without telling him, Meena cares for Mohan as he recuperates.\n\nRamu comes first in the exams and comes to know of Mohan's sacrifice. He rushes to Mohan in hospital to ask for forgiveness where Mohan says that he was never angry with him. The doctor tells Mohan about Meena and he forgives her. The movie ends with all of them in a loving embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* Sushil Kumar (real name Sushil Belani) as Ramnath 'Ramu' Gupta\n* Sudhir Kumar (real name Sudhir Sawant) as Mohan\n* [[Baby Farida]] as Manjula 'Manju'\n* [[Sanjay Khan]] as Ashok\n* [[Leela Mishra]] as Mausi\n* [[Leela Chitnis]] as Ramu's mother, Mrs. Gupta\n* [[Abhi Bhattacharya]] as Headmaster\n* Uma Rajoo as Nurse Meena (Mohan's sister)\n* Aziz\n* [[Nana Palsikar]] as School Teacher Sharma ji\n* Moolchand as Ashok's employee\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe lyrics of the film are written by [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]] on music composed by [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]].

When he tries to tell Mohan about Meena, Mohan lashes out in rage and says that he considers himself alone in this world, save for his friend Ramu.\n\nSoon after, Ramu gets in trouble with some ruffians and as a result is mistakenly arrested by police during a burglary. Sharma ji goes to police station and bails out Ramu on the condition that he will live with Sharma ji and keep no contact with Mohan. Mohan is heartbroken and decides to visit him. But Sharma ji didn't allow him to talk to Mohan. Sad, Mohan roams the streets singing sad songs.\n\nSharmaji suddenly dies, leaving Ramu shattered. Ramu decides not to appear for the final exam as he cannot pay the fees. Hearing this, Mohan decides to raise the money once again by singing in streets in spite of his ill health. He successfully earns the money and pays the fees without Ramu knowing, but himself falls prey to illness and is admitted in hospital. In hospital, without telling him, Meena cares for Mohan as he recuperates.\n\nRamu comes first in the exams and comes to know of Mohan's sacrifice. He rushes to Mohan in hospital to ask for forgiveness where Mohan says that he was never angry with him. The doctor tells Mohan about Meena and he forgives her.

In 1995, Sixteenth session of the Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 18\u201319 December 1995) agreed on the need to strive for the realization of SAFTA and to this end, an Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG) was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for progressing to a free trade area. The Tenth SAARC Summit ([[Colombo]], 29\u201331 July 1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to draft a comprehensive treaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking into consideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in mind the need to fix realistic and achievable targets.\n\nThe SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit held in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]]. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2006, and the Trade Liberalization Programme commenced from 1 July 2006. Under this agreement, SAARC members will bring their duties down to 20 percent by 2009. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA Ministerial Council (SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/areaofcooperation/detail.php?activity_id=5|title=South Asian Association For Regional Cooperation&nbsp;\u2014 Area of Cooperation|work=saarc-sec.org}}</ref> In 2012 the SAARC exports increased substantially to $354.6 billion from $206.7 billion in 2009. Imports too increased from $330 billion to $602 billion over the same period. But the intra-SAARC trade amounts to just a little over 1% of SAARC's GDP. In contrast to SAARC, in [[ASEAN]] (which is actually smaller than SAARC in terms of the size of the economy) the intra-bloc trade stands at 10% of its GDP.\n\nSAFTA was envisaged to gradually move towards the South Asian Economic Union, but the current intra-regional trade and investment relation are not encouraging and it may be difficult to achieve this target. The SAARC intra-regional trade stands at just five percent on the share of intra-regional trade in overall trade in [[South Asia]]. Similarly, [[foreign direct investment]] is also dismal. The intra-regional FDI flow stands at around four percent of the total foreign investment.<ref>\n{{Cite web| url=http://thehimalayantimes.com/business/safta-meet-likely-next-month/| title=SAFTA meet likely next month| date=2016-03-25| access-date=22 January 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202035248/http://thehimalayantimes.com/business/safta-meet-likely-next-month/| archive-date=2 February 2017| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Asian Development Bank]] has estimated that inter-regional trade in SAARC region possessed the potential of shooting up agricultural exports by $14 billion per year from existing level of $8 billion to $22 billion. The study by [[Asian Development Bank]] states that against the potential average SAARC intra-regional trade of $22 billion per year, the actual trade in South Asia has been only around $8 billion. The uncaptured potential for intra-regional trade is therefore $14 billion per year, i.e., 68%.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/142861-ADB-urges-Safta-to-exploit-rich-trade-potential-of-member-countries |title=ADB urges Safta to exploit rich trade potential of member countries |access-date=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004901/https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/142861-ADB-urges-Safta-to-exploit-rich-trade-potential-of-member-countries |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Coming-closer-together-for-trade/article14628676.ece| title=Coming closer together for trade| newspaper=The Hindu| date=2016-09-08| last1=Ranjan| first1=Prabhash| access-date=22 January 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203104015/http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Coming-closer-together-for-trade/article14628676.ece| archive-date=3 December 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\n==SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme==\nThe SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme was launched in 1992. The leaders at the Fourth Summit (Islamabad, 29\u201331 December 1988), realizing the importance of people-to-people contact among SAARC countries, decided that certain categories of dignitaries should be entitled to a Special Travel document. The document would exempt them from visas within the region. As directed by the Summit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of entitled categories.\n\nCurrently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include dignitaries, judges of higher courts, parliamentarians, senior officials, entrepreneurs, journalists, and athletes.\n\nThe Visa Stickers are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled categories of that particular country. The validity of the Visa Sticker is generally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the Immigration Authorities of SAARC Member States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/SAARC-Visa-Exemption-Scheme/100/|title=South Asian Association For Regional Cooperation&nbsp;\u2014 SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme|work=saarc-sec.org}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n\n===SAARC Award===\n\nThe Twelfth (12th) Summit approved the SAARC Award to support individuals and organizations within the region.

In 1995, Sixteenth session of the Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 18\u201319 December 1995) agreed on the need to strive for the realization of SAFTA and to this end, an Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG) was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for progressing to a free trade area. The Tenth SAARC Summit ([[Colombo]], 29\u201331 July 1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to draft a comprehensive treaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking into consideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in mind the need to fix realistic and achievable targets.\n\nThe SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit held in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]]. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2006, and the Trade Liberalization Programme commenced from 1 July 2006. Under this agreement, SAARC members will bring their duties down to 20 percent by 2009. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA Ministerial Council (SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/areaofcooperation/detail.php?activity_id=5|title=South Asian Association For Regional Cooperation&nbsp;\u2014 Area of Cooperation|work=saarc-sec.org}}</ref> In 2012 the SAARC exports increased substantially to $354.6 billion from $206.7 billion in 2009. Imports too increased from $330 billion to $602 billion over the same period. But the intra-SAARC trade amounts to just a little over 1% of SAARC's GDP. In contrast to SAARC, in [[ASEAN]] (which is actually smaller than SAARC in terms of the size of the economy) the intra-bloc trade stands at 10% of its GDP.\n\nSAFTA was envisaged to gradually move towards the South Asian Economic Union, but the current intra-regional trade and investment relation are not encouraging and it may be difficult to achieve this target. The SAARC intra-regional trade stands at just five percent on the share of intra-regional trade in overall trade in [[South Asia]]. Similarly, [[foreign direct investment]] is also dismal. The intra-regional FDI flow stands at around four percent of the total foreign investment.<ref>\n{{Cite web| url=http://thehimalayantimes.com/business/safta-meet-likely-next-month/| title=SAFTA meet likely next month| date=2016-03-25| access-date=22 January 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202035248/http://thehimalayantimes.com/business/safta-meet-likely-next-month/| archive-date=2 February 2017| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Asian Development Bank]] has estimated that inter-regional trade in SAARC region possessed the potential of shooting up agricultural exports by $14 billion per year from existing level of $8 billion to $22 billion. The study by [[Asian Development Bank]] states that against the potential average SAARC intra-regional trade of $22 billion per year, the actual trade in South Asia has been only around $8 billion.

The leaders at the Fourth Summit (Islamabad, 29\u201331 December 1988), realizing the importance of people-to-people contact among SAARC countries, decided that certain categories of dignitaries should be entitled to a Special Travel document. The document would exempt them from visas within the region. As directed by the Summit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of entitled categories.\n\nCurrently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include dignitaries, judges of higher courts, parliamentarians, senior officials, entrepreneurs, journalists, and athletes.\n\nThe Visa Stickers are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled categories of that particular country. The validity of the Visa Sticker is generally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the Immigration Authorities of SAARC Member States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/SAARC-Visa-Exemption-Scheme/100/|title=South Asian Association For Regional Cooperation&nbsp;\u2014 SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme|work=saarc-sec.org}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n\n===SAARC Award===\n\nThe Twelfth (12th) Summit approved the SAARC Award to support individuals and organizations within the region.

There was also concern over those seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had journeyed in the hopes of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} To the State, they threatened the stability of the kingdom and its economy it became urgent to the group and distance them.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the men in the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}} and the war, deemed very unpopular. Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.
