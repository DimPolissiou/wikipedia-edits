It is a common and widely distributed species, and has been found in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus produces reddish-brown to reddish-purple [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with conic to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide held by slender [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} high. When fresh, the fruit bodies will \"bleed\" a dark reddish-purple [[latex|sap]]. The similar ''[[Mycena haematopus]]'' is larger, and grows on decaying wood, usually in clumps. ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' contains [[alkaloid]] pigments that are unique to the species, may produce an [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] compound, and is [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]]. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst called ''Agaricus sanguinolentus'' by [[Johannes Baptista von Albertini]], the species was transferred to the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1871 by German [[Paul Kummer]],<ref name=Kummer1871/> when he raised many of Fries' \"tribes\" to the rank of genus. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sanguinolentus'' and means \"bloody\".<ref name=Wakefield1950/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"bleeding bonnet\"<ref name=BMS/> the \"smaller bleeding Mycena\",<ref name=Roody2003/> or the \"terrestrial bleeding Mycena\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lactipedes'' along with other latex-producing species.<ref>Smith 1947, pp. 132\u201333.</ref> A [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of several dozen European ''Mycena'' species suggests that ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is closely related to {{species|M|ycena|galopus}}.

As it expands, it becomes broadly convex or bell-shaped, ultimately reaching a diameter of {{convert|3|\u2013|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Arora1986/> The surface is initially covered with a dense whitish-grayish coating or powder that is produced by delicate microscopic cells, but these cells soon collapse and disappear, leaving the surface naked and smooth. The surface is moist with an opaque margin that soon developing furrows. The cap color is variable but always some shade of bright or dull reddish brown with a dull grayish-brown margin. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, not very fragile, sordid reddish, and exudes a reddish latex when cut. The odor and taste are not distinctive.<ref name=\"Smith p.146-49\"/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] or slightly toothed, and well-spaced.

It is a common and widely distributed species, and has been found in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus produces reddish-brown to reddish-purple [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with conic to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide held by slender [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} high. When fresh, the fruit bodies will \"bleed\" a dark reddish-purple [[latex|sap]]. The similar ''[[Mycena haematopus]]'' is larger, and grows on decaying wood, usually in clumps. ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' contains [[alkaloid]] pigments that are unique to the species, may produce an [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] compound, and is [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]]. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst called ''Agaricus sanguinolentus'' by [[Johannes Baptista von Albertini]], the species was transferred to the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1871 by German [[Paul Kummer]],<ref name=Kummer1871/> when he raised many of Fries' \"tribes\" to the rank of genus. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sanguinolentus'' and means \"bloody\".<ref name=Wakefield1950/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"bleeding bonnet\"<ref name=BMS/> the \"smaller bleeding Mycena\",<ref name=Roody2003/> or the \"terrestrial bleeding Mycena\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lactipedes'' along with other latex-producing species.<ref>Smith 1947, pp. 132\u201333.</ref> A [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of several dozen European ''Mycena'' species suggests that ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is closely related to {{species|M|ycena|galopus}}.

As it expands, it becomes broadly convex or bell-shaped, ultimately reaching a diameter of {{convert|3|\u2013|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Arora1986/> The surface is initially covered with a dense whitish-grayish coating or powder that is produced by delicate microscopic cells, but these cells soon collapse and disappear, leaving the surface naked and smooth. The surface is moist with an opaque margin that soon developing furrows. The cap color is variable but always some shade of bright or dull reddish brown with a dull grayish-brown margin. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, not very fragile, sordid reddish, and exudes a reddish latex when cut. The odor and taste are not distinctive.<ref name=\"Smith p.146-49\"/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] or slightly toothed, and well-spaced.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|2|\u2013|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, 1\u20131.5&nbsp;mm thick, equal in width throughout, and fragile. The base of the stipe is covered with coarse, stiff white hairs, while the remainder is covered with a drab powder that soon sloughs off to leave the stipe polished, and more or less the same color as the cap.

It took place among the [[Aegates Islands]], off the western coast of the island of [[Sicily]]. The Carthaginians were commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], and the Romans were under the overall authority of [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], but [[Quintus Valerius Falto]] had the battle command. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.\n\nThe Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.\n\nAs a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Lutatius]], by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial [[War reparations|reparations]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.{{sfn|Royal|Tusa|2019|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n==Background==\n===Operations in Sicily===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC, the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River Arno had recently been [[Roman expansion in Italy|unified under Roman control]]. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nBy 241 BC, the war had lasted 23 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome was essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} Largely because of the Romans' use of the {{lang|la|corvus}}, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] (260 BC), [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] (257 BC), [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] (256 BC) and [[Battle of Cape Hermaea|Cape Hermaeum]] (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the {{lang|la|corvus}} may have contributed to this disaster.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} In any event, they did not use the {{lang|la|corvus}} thereafter.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=86}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\n===Ships===\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a [[trireme]]|{{center|Depiction of the position of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek trireme}}]]\n\nDuring this period the standard warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100 [[long tons]] (110 [[short tons]]; 100 tonnes). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested that they could maintain 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}}\n\nVessels were built as cataphract, or \"protected\", ships, with a closed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improving conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}} The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets \u2013 or files \u2013 of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=101}}\n\nIn 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and so slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], although [[hexareme]]s (six oarsmen per bank), [[quadriremes]] (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines;{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. To counter Carthaginian superiority, the Romans introduced the [[corvus (weapon)|''corvus'']], a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}} This allowed [[Roman legion|Roman legionaries]] acting as marines to [[Naval boarding|board enemy ships]] and capture them, rather than employing the previously traditional tactic of ramming. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]], and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the larger and heavier vessels adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in case of a successful attack. The Roman adaptation of the {{lang|la|corvus}} was a continuation of this trend and compensated for their initial disadvantage in ship manoeuvring skills. The added weight in the prow compromised the ship's manoeuvrability, and in rough sea conditions the {{lang|la|corvus}} became useless.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Wallinga|1956|pp=77\u201390}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=100\u2013101, 103}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|left|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nThe Carthaginians finally gained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122}} The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission her navy, reducing the financial strain of building, maintaining and repairing ships, and providing and provisioning their crews.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=193}} Certainly they withdrew most of their warships from Sicily.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92, 94}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the [[Berbers#Antiquity|Libyans]], especially the [[Numidians]]. [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]] had been in charge of operations in Africa since 248 BC and had conquered considerable territory by 241 BC. Carthage probably viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=94}}\n\nBy 248 BC, the Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} When [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]] from his base at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\nAfter more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\nEarly in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie 15\u201340 kilometres (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements{{snd}}either 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sources{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}}{{snd}}and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=117}} The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]]; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by [[blockade runner]]s. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n==New Roman fleet==\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the [[Roman Senate]] decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}}{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], assisted by the [[praetor]] [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=123\u2013124}} Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became [[proconsul]] and [[Promagistrate|propraetor]] respectively.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=152}}{{sfn|Smith|1870|pp=135, 138}}\n \nThe garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepana{{snd}}and Hamilcar's army at Eryx{{snd}}held fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Aegades241a.png|thumb|upright=1.35|{{center|The course of the battle}}|alt=A map showing the movements of both fleets during the battle]]\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]]. This is possibly the general who had lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battles of Agrigentum]] and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=153}} The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a [[Following sea|following]] wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the {{convert|45|km|mi}} to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargos, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade and took on board his 200 quinqueremes a full complement of marines from the soldiers of the besieging Roman army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa, {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} Hanno immediately set sail for Lilybaeum. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Hamilcar Barca and Lilybaeum. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}} Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}}\n[[File:Q.

Having little choice, the Carthaginians lowered their sails and engaged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=155}} \n\nIn the ensuing battle the Romans enjoyed far greater mobility, since their vessels were carrying only the bare necessities, while the Carthaginians were burdened with the equipment necessary for sustained travel and provisions for the Sicilian garrisons. The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar's soldiers.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=155}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=195\u2013196}} It was the first time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the {{lang|la|corvus}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships' greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. 50 Carthaginian ships were sunk, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with up to 10,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=271}} However, the battle was hard fought, with the Romans losing 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore to save weight and so were unable to pursue. The Carthaginian remnants returned to Carthage, where their unsuccessful commander was crucified.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:PICT0510 - Largo di Torre Argentina (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|{{center|Remains of the [[Temple of Juturna]] at [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], built by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] to celebrate his victory.}}|alt=A photograph of Roman ruins in a modern street setting]]\n\nCatulus was granted a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] to celebrate his victory, while Falto was granted a separate and slightly junior triumph.{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=272}} To celebrate the victory, Catulus built a temple to [[Juturna]] in the [[Campus Martius]], in the area of Rome currently known as the [[Largo di Torre Argentina]]. Elements of this building survive to the present-day.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=609}}\n\nAfter achieving this decisive victory over the Carthaginian fleet, Catulus continued the land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum, Eryx and Drepana; which continued to be defended by Hamilcar Barca and his army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}} The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Carthage had taken nine months to fit out the fleet that was defeated, and if they took another nine months to ready another fleet, the Sicilian cities still holding out would run out of supplies and [[Suing for peace|request terms]]. Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nHenceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built over 1,000 galleys during the war; and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=128\u2013129, 357, 359\u2013360}}\n\n==Marine archaeology==\n[[File:Carthaginian naval ram.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=A large, worked block of bronze|{{center|A Carthaginian naval ram recovered from the site of the battle showing damage in the form of V-shaped scratches, attributed to frontal collision(s) with a Roman ship \u2013 ram against ram.{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=37}}}}]]\n\nSince 2010 eleven bronze warship rams have been found by archaeologists in the sea within a {{convert|1|km2|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} area off Phorbantia, along with ten bronze helmets and hundreds of [[amphorae]].{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Pragg|2013}}{{sfn|Murray|2019|}} The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a number of fragments, have since been recovered.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=12, 26, 31\u201332}} Inscriptions allowed four of the rams to be identified as coming from Roman-built ships, one from a Carthaginian vessel, with the origins of the remaining two being unknown.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=18}} It is possible that some of the Roman-built vessels had been captured by the Carthaginians earlier in the war and were crewed by them when they were sunk.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=45}} It is believed that the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=39}} Six of the helmets were of the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino type]] typically used by the legions, three with one or both bronze cheek pieces still attached;

It took place among the [[Aegates Islands]], off the western coast of the island of [[Sicily]]. The Carthaginians were commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], and the Romans were under the overall authority of [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], but [[Quintus Valerius Falto]] had the battle command. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.\n\nThe Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.\n\nAs a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Lutatius]], by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial [[War reparations|reparations]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.{{sfn|Royal|Tusa|2019|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n==Background==\n===Operations in Sicily===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC, the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River Arno had recently been [[Roman expansion in Italy|unified under Roman control]]. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nBy 241 BC, the war had lasted 23 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome was essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} Largely because of the Romans' use of the {{lang|la|corvus}}, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] (260 BC), [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] (257 BC), [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] (256 BC) and [[Battle of Cape Hermaea|Cape Hermaeum]] (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the {{lang|la|corvus}} may have contributed to this disaster.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} In any event, they did not use the {{lang|la|corvus}} thereafter.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=86}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\n===Ships===\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a [[trireme]]|{{center|Depiction of the position of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek trireme}}]]\n\nDuring this period the standard warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100 [[long tons]] (110 [[short tons]]; 100 tonnes). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested that they could maintain 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}}\n\nVessels were built as cataphract, or \"protected\", ships, with a closed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improving conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}} The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets \u2013 or files \u2013 of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=101}}\n\nIn 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and so slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], although [[hexareme]]s (six oarsmen per bank), [[quadriremes]] (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines;{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. To counter Carthaginian superiority, the Romans introduced the [[corvus (weapon)|''corvus'']], a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}} This allowed [[Roman legion|Roman legionaries]] acting as marines to [[Naval boarding|board enemy ships]] and capture them, rather than employing the previously traditional tactic of ramming. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]], and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the larger and heavier vessels adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in case of a successful attack. The Roman adaptation of the {{lang|la|corvus}} was a continuation of this trend and compensated for their initial disadvantage in ship manoeuvring skills. The added weight in the prow compromised the ship's manoeuvrability, and in rough sea conditions the {{lang|la|corvus}} became useless.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Wallinga|1956|pp=77\u201390}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=100\u2013101, 103}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|left|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nThe Carthaginians finally gained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122}} The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission her navy, reducing the financial strain of building, maintaining and repairing ships, and providing and provisioning their crews.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=193}} Certainly they withdrew most of their warships from Sicily.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92, 94}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the [[Berbers#Antiquity|Libyans]], especially the [[Numidians]]. [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]] had been in charge of operations in Africa since 248 BC and had conquered considerable territory by 241 BC. Carthage probably viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=94}}\n\nBy 248 BC, the Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} When [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]] from his base at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\nAfter more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\nEarly in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie 15\u201340 kilometres (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements{{snd}}either 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sources{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}}{{snd}}and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=117}} The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]]; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by [[blockade runner]]s. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n==New Roman fleet==\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the [[Roman Senate]] decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}}{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], assisted by the [[praetor]] [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=123\u2013124}} Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became [[proconsul]] and [[Promagistrate|propraetor]] respectively.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=152}}{{sfn|Smith|1870|pp=135, 138}}\n \nThe garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepana{{snd}}and Hamilcar's army at Eryx{{snd}}held fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Aegades241a.png|thumb|upright=1.35|{{center|The course of the battle}}|alt=A map showing the movements of both fleets during the battle]]\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]]. This is possibly the general who had lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battles of Agrigentum]] and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=153}} The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a [[Following sea|following]] wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the {{convert|45|km|mi}} to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargos, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade and took on board his 200 quinqueremes a full complement of marines from the soldiers of the besieging Roman army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa, {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} Hanno immediately set sail for Lilybaeum. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Hamilcar Barca and Lilybaeum. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}} Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}}\n[[File:Q.

Having little choice, the Carthaginians lowered their sails and engaged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=155}} \n\nIn the ensuing battle the Romans enjoyed far greater mobility, since their vessels were carrying only the bare necessities, while the Carthaginians were burdened with the equipment necessary for sustained travel and provisions for the Sicilian garrisons. The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar's soldiers.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=155}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=195\u2013196}} It was the first time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the {{lang|la|corvus}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships' greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. 50 Carthaginian ships were sunk, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with up to 10,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=271}} However, the battle was hard fought, with the Romans losing 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore to save weight and so were unable to pursue. The Carthaginian remnants returned to Carthage, where their unsuccessful commander was crucified.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:PICT0510 - Largo di Torre Argentina (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|{{center|Remains of the [[Temple of Juturna]] at [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], built by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] to celebrate his victory.}}|alt=A photograph of Roman ruins in a modern street setting]]\n\nCatulus was granted a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] to celebrate his victory, while Falto was granted a separate and slightly junior triumph.{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=272}} To celebrate the victory, Catulus built a temple to [[Juturna]] in the [[Campus Martius]], in the area of Rome currently known as the [[Largo di Torre Argentina]].

Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nHenceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.

By increasing piston stroke and decreasing piston bore, Subaru aimed to reduce emissions and improve [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], while increasing and broadening torque output compared to the EJ-series.\n\n==Overview==\nThe FB has an all new block and head featuring [[dual overhead cam]]s with intake and exhaust [[variable valve timing]] (which Subaru designates as AVCS, standing for [[Active Valve Control System]]), and a [[timing chain]] that replaced the [[Timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. Moving to chain-driven cams is said to allow the valves to be placed at a more narrow angle to each other and shrink the bore of cylinder from {{convert|99.5|to|94|mm|abbr=on}}. It results in less unburned fuel during cold start, thereby reducing emissions.

|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> It follows the [[Subaru EJ engine|previous generation EJ-series engine]] which was introduced in 1989 and the [[Subaru EA engine|first generation EA-series]] which was introduced in 1966. By increasing piston stroke and decreasing piston bore, Subaru aimed to reduce emissions and improve [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], while increasing and broadening torque output compared to the EJ-series.\n\n==Overview==\nThe FB has an all new block and head featuring [[dual overhead cam]]s with intake and exhaust [[variable valve timing]] (which Subaru designates as AVCS, standing for [[Active Valve Control System]]), and a [[timing chain]] that replaced the [[Timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. Moving to chain-driven cams is said to allow the valves to be placed at a more narrow angle to each other and shrink the bore of cylinder from {{convert|99.5|to|94|mm|abbr=on}}. It results in less unburned fuel during cold start, thereby reducing emissions.

It is a common and abundant species in the coastal oak woodlands of [[California]], where it grows [[saprobic]]ally, feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various [[oak]] species. First described in 1860 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis|Curtis]], the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition.

If cut, the mushroom tissue will \"bleed\" a deep reddish to orangish [[latex]]. As is typical of the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', caps of ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' are bluntly conical, becoming bell-shaped to convex, and eventually flatten out when old.

The single collection was found growing on fallen [[oak]] leaves at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], in [[Solano County, California]] in January 1856. The specimen was sent by American mycologist [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] to his British colleague [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]], who published a brief description of the species in 1860, calling it ''Agaricus californiensis'', in what was then the [[subgenus]] ''Mycena''. Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from ''A.&nbsp;aurantio-marginatus'' (known today as ''[[Mycena aurantiomarginata]]'')<ref name=\"urlFungorum - Species synonymy\"/> in the nature of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and they called it \"a more graceful species.\"<ref name=Berkeley1860/> In his 1887 ''Sylloge Fungorum'', [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] raised the subgenus ''Mycena'' to generic status, so the species became known as ''Mycena californiensis''.<ref name=Saccardo1887/>\n\nIn his 1947 [[monograph]] of North American ''Mycena'', [[Alexander H.

He compared isotype material (material collected at the same time and place as the [[holotype]]) of ''M. californiensis'' with Californian specimens and the type of ''M.&nbsp;elegantula'' and found all of them to represent the same species, publishing the results with Dennis Desjardin in their 1999 ''Mycotaxon'' article \"''Mycena californiensis'' resurrected\".

The cap margins (edges) are curved inwards when young, but as they age they become wavy or [[wikt:crenate|crenate]] (with rounded scallops), develop striations (radial grooves) and may even split. The surface of the cap is dull and smooth. Its color ranges from reddish brown to  brownish orange in young specimens, with the color fading as the mushroom matures; the center of the cap is usually darker than the margins. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, and either the same color as the cap or lighter; it may stain a dark red color when bruised.[[File:Mycena californiensis 72627.jpg|thumb|left|The white to light pink gills have darker-colored edges.]]The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] attachment to the stem\u2014broadly attached slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem. They are not closely spaced together, and there are about 15\u201320 of them. Some of the gills do not extend the full distance from the edge of the cap to the stem. These short gills, called ''lamellulae'', form one to two groups of roughly equal length. All of the gills have a white to pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] color, with the gill edges ranging from reddish orange to reddish brown to brownish orange. The hollow stem is {{convert|29|\u2013|130|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and roughly the same thickness throughout. The top of the stem may be either [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing to be covered with a very fine whitish powder on a surface) or smooth, while the stem base is covered with \"hairs\" that may be strigose (large, coarse, and bristle-like) to [[wikt:downy|downy]] (soft and fuzzy).

Further details are revealed with a [[light microscope]]: the spores are [[ellipsoid]] to almond-shaped, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8\u201312 by 4\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and typically have dimensions of 26\u201337.5 by 7\u201310.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' has [[wikt:cheilocystidum|cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill edges) that measure 16\u201350 by 6.5\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcm. These cells have irregular projections that can range in size from 1.5\u201318.8 by 1.5\u20136.5&nbsp;\u03bcm and are variously shaped, from knob-like to cylindrical. The cells contain brownish contents that will stain darkly with [[Melzer's reagent]], a common [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical reagent]] used in mushroom identification.

Another ''Mycena'' commonly confused with ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is ''[[Mycena sanguinolenta|M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta]]'', a species that also exudes reddish latex.

The top of the stem may be either [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing to be covered with a very fine whitish powder on a surface) or smooth, while the stem base is covered with \"hairs\" that may be strigose (large, coarse, and bristle-like) to [[wikt:downy|downy]] (soft and fuzzy). The stem is some shade of brown. The mushroom tissue will \"bleed\" a brownish-range to reddish-brown [[latex]] when it is cut.<ref name=Perry1992/> The edibility of ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is unknown.<ref name=\"url CA Fungi\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nIn deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], the [[spore]]s appear white. Further details are revealed with a [[light microscope]]: the spores are [[ellipsoid]] to almond-shaped, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8\u201312 by 4\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and typically have dimensions of 26\u201337.5 by 7\u201310.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' has [[wikt:cheilocystidum|cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill edges) that measure 16\u201350 by 6.5\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcm. These cells have irregular projections that can range in size from 1.5\u201318.8 by 1.5\u20136.5&nbsp;\u03bcm and are variously shaped, from knob-like to cylindrical. The cells contain brownish contents that will stain darkly with [[Melzer's reagent]], a common [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical reagent]] used in mushroom identification. With the exception of the medullary [[hypha]]e of the stem (longitudinally-arranged hyphae making up the stem surface), all hyphae contain [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=Perry1992/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Potential lookalike species include ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' (left) and ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' (right)\n| image1    = Mycena purpureofusca 65470.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (150 * 2592 / 1944) round 0}}\n| image2    = Mycena sanguinolenta - Lindsey.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (150 * 398 / 600) round 0}}\n}}\n\n''Mycena californiensis'' may be distinguished from the closely related ''[[Mycena atromarginata|M.&nbsp;atromarginata]]'' by its smaller size and the purplish tint to the edge of the gills, and from ''[[Mycena purpureofusca|M.&nbsp;purpureofusca]]'' by its differently shaped, longer spores. Another ''Mycena'' commonly confused with ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is ''[[Mycena sanguinolenta|M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta]]'', a species that also exudes reddish latex. It can be distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' by the [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] (tapering at each end) cheilocystidia that do not have outgrowths. An additional difference between the two is that ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is associated with [[conifer]] wood and debris.<ref name=Perry1992/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies grow in clusters or scattered on the decomposing leaves and acorns of oak trees, such as [[Quercus agrifolia|Coast Live Oak]], [[Quercus lobata|Valley Oak]] and [[Quercus kelloggii|Black Oak]].

Earlier she was as Executive Counselor to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA) from 2001 to 2007 and as Associate Commissioner and Deputy Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals at SSA from 1992-2001.\n\nPreviously, Geier was General Counsel for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC)1988-1992.

In 1973, a group of parents, teachers, and faculty members were allowed to intervene. In 1983, the district court allowed another group of black and white TSU faculty members and students to intervene. Also in 1983, the district court allowed the Alumni Association, which consists of graduates of TSU, to appear as amicus curiae.\n\nIn 1984, all of the parties except the United States agreed to a settlement agreement, which the district court entered as an order. The Settlement was affirmed in Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799 (6th Cir. 1986). Under the Settlement, defendants agreed to promote system-wide desegregation by a variety of means including (1) attempting to obtain a student body at TSU that is 50% white; (2) assuring that changes in admissions policies do not have adverse racial impact; and (3) actively recruiting African-American faculty and administrative staff for Tennessee's predominantly white institutions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThirty-eight years after first filing her case, Geier stood alongside Gov.

Earlier she was as Executive Counselor to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA) from 2001 to 2007 and as Associate Commissioner and Deputy Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals at SSA from 1992-2001.\n\nPreviously, Geier was General Counsel for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC)1988-1992. Her work at ARC followed nine years with the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) Civil Division, where she was Assistant Director for Commercial Litigation and Senior Trial Counsel.

In 1973, a group of parents, teachers, and faculty members were allowed to intervene. In 1983, the district court allowed another group of black and white TSU faculty members and students to intervene. Also in 1983, the district court allowed the Alumni Association, which consists of graduates of TSU, to appear as amicus curiae.\n\nIn 1984, all of the parties except the United States agreed to a settlement agreement, which the district court entered as an order. The Settlement was affirmed in Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799 (6th Cir. 1986). Under the Settlement, defendants agreed to promote system-wide desegregation by a variety of means including (1) attempting to obtain a student body at TSU that is 50% white; (2) assuring that changes in admissions policies do not have adverse racial impact; and (3) actively recruiting African-American faculty and administrative staff for Tennessee's predominantly white institutions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThirty-eight years after first filing her case, Geier stood alongside Gov.

The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], or [[mushroom]]s, have conic to bell-shaped to convex [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are initially dark brown but fade to brownish-gray when young, reaching diameters of up to {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are typically wrinkled or somewhat grooved, and have reddish-brown spots in age, or after being cut or bruised. The whitish to pale gray [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] also become spotted reddish-brown as they mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], up to {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and covered with whitish hairs at its base, can also develop reddish stains. The [[mycelium]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' has [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties. The [[saprobic]] fungus is found in Europe and North America, where it grows in groups or clusters on the rotting wood of both [[hardwood]]s and [[conifer]]s. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fungus is unknown. Although the species is known for, and named after its propensity to stain reddish, occasionally these stains do not appear, making it virtually indistinguishable from ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was first [[species description|described scientifically]] by the German mycologist [[Petter Karsten]] in 1890.<ref name=Karsten1980/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena maculata\"/> The name ''Mycena maculata'' was also used by the Australian mycologist [[John Burton Cleland]] in 1934,<ref name=Cleland1934/> but that usage was considered illegitimate,<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena maculata Cleland\"/> and the species he described has since been renamed to ''[[Mycena austromaculata]]'' by Cheryl Grgurinovic and [[Tom May (mycologist)|Tom May]] in 1997.<ref name=Grgurinovic1997/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''maculata'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word \"spotted\".<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> The mushroom is commonly known as the \"reddish-spotted Mycena\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena maculata 60204.jpg|thumb|left|The whitish gills develop reddish-brown stains as they mature.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' varies in shape from broadly conic to convex initially, soon expanding to bell-shaped or broadly convex at maturity; when expanded the cap diameter is typically between {{convert|2|and|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It usually has a distinct [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which can be abruptly convex in some individuals and very broad and low in others. The cap margin closely approaches the stem when young, but often flares or curves upward with age. The cap surface is smooth, slimy to the touch, often opaque when young but becomes partially translucent so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap may be seen nearly to the center, before fading. It is often somewhat wrinkled or has the radial gill grooves deepening with age. It is initially dirty blackish-brown or nearly black, becoming paler dirty brown to brownish-gray with age, and usually with reddish-brown spots. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is somewhat thick under the umbo, but becomes abruptly thinner over the area of the margin (about 0.15&nbsp;mm). It is [[wikt:cartilaginous|cartilaginous]] and firm, dark or pale watery gray, changing slowly to dirty reddish-brown when cut or bruised. It has no distinguishable odor, and a taste ranging from mild to slightly [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] (like flour).<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/>\n\nThe [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are bluntly [[adnation|adnate]], later becoming toothed and somewhat [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]]. The gills are narrow, becoming moderately broad (4\u20135&nbsp;mm), whitish to pale gray in color, soon staining with reddish spots.  Sometimes the gills separate slightly from the cap, but remain attached to each other to form a collar. The gill spacing is close to subdistant, with about 17\u201324 gills reaching the stem; there are additionally about three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The stem is usually {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, occasionally much longer, often with a long pseudorhiza (a cordlike structure resembling a plant root) {{convert|1|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} that can root into the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The stem is densely covered with sharp, stiff white hairs on the lower portion, and smooth above. It is sometimes twisted, nearly equal in width throughout, hollow, and cartilaginous. The top portion of the stem is pallid, while the remainder is the same color or paler than the cap. The stem base becomes stained reddish-brown to purplish, or the entire lower portion turns a dirty [[wine (color)|wine red]].<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\">Smith, 1947, pp. 341\u201343.</ref> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe spores are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (meaning they turn bluish-black to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), and measure 7\u20139 by 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are 30\u201335 by 7\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are embedded in the hymenium and inconspicuous, measuring 20\u201328 by 6\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm. They are irregular in form; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part, others have irregular branched finger-like protuberances, while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in ''Mycena maculata''. The gill tissue is [[hyaline]] or very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap tissue has a thin [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells, while the remainder is filamentous, and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous-brown in iodine.<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/> The [[mycelium]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' is [[bioluminescent]];<ref name=Treu1990/> this property has not been reported for the fruit bodies.<ref name=Desjardin2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = right\n| image1 = Mycena galericulata 60303.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| caption1 = ''M. galericulata''\n| image2 = Mycena haematopus 56359.jpg\n| width2 =177\n| caption2 = ''M. haematopus''\n}}\nIn the absence of the characteristic reddish staining (particularly in young specimens), ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' is indistinguishable in the field from ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]'', which also tends to grow in groups or [[wikt:tuft|tufts]] on wood.

Although the species is known for, and named after its propensity to stain reddish, occasionally these stains do not appear, making it virtually indistinguishable from ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was first [[species description|described scientifically]] by the German mycologist [[Petter Karsten]] in 1890.<ref name=Karsten1980/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena maculata\"/> The name ''Mycena maculata'' was also used by the Australian mycologist [[John Burton Cleland]] in 1934,<ref name=Cleland1934/> but that usage was considered illegitimate,<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena maculata Cleland\"/> and the species he described has since been renamed to ''[[Mycena austromaculata]]'' by Cheryl Grgurinovic and [[Tom May (mycologist)|Tom May]] in 1997.<ref name=Grgurinovic1997/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''maculata'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word \"spotted\".<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> The mushroom is commonly known as the \"reddish-spotted Mycena\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena maculata 60204.jpg|thumb|left|The whitish gills develop reddish-brown stains as they mature.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' varies in shape from broadly conic to convex initially, soon expanding to bell-shaped or broadly convex at maturity; when expanded the cap diameter is typically between {{convert|2|and|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It usually has a distinct [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which can be abruptly convex in some individuals and very broad and low in others. The cap margin closely approaches the stem when young, but often flares or curves upward with age. The cap surface is smooth, slimy to the touch, often opaque when young but becomes partially translucent so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap may be seen nearly to the center, before fading. It is often somewhat wrinkled or has the radial gill grooves deepening with age. It is initially dirty blackish-brown or nearly black, becoming paler dirty brown to brownish-gray with age, and usually with reddish-brown spots. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is somewhat thick under the umbo, but becomes abruptly thinner over the area of the margin (about 0.15&nbsp;mm). It is [[wikt:cartilaginous|cartilaginous]] and firm, dark or pale watery gray, changing slowly to dirty reddish-brown when cut or bruised. It has no distinguishable odor, and a taste ranging from mild to slightly [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] (like flour).<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/>\n\nThe [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are bluntly [[adnation|adnate]], later becoming toothed and somewhat [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]]. The gills are narrow, becoming moderately broad (4\u20135&nbsp;mm), whitish to pale gray in color, soon staining with reddish spots.  Sometimes the gills separate slightly from the cap, but remain attached to each other to form a collar. The gill spacing is close to subdistant, with about 17\u201324 gills reaching the stem; there are additionally about three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The stem is usually {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, occasionally much longer, often with a long pseudorhiza (a cordlike structure resembling a plant root) {{convert|1|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} that can root into the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The stem is densely covered with sharp, stiff white hairs on the lower portion, and smooth above. It is sometimes twisted, nearly equal in width throughout, hollow, and cartilaginous. The top portion of the stem is pallid, while the remainder is the same color or paler than the cap. The stem base becomes stained reddish-brown to purplish, or the entire lower portion turns a dirty [[wine (color)|wine red]].<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\">Smith, 1947, pp. 341\u201343.</ref> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe spores are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (meaning they turn bluish-black to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), and measure 7\u20139 by 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are 30\u201335 by 7\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are embedded in the hymenium and inconspicuous, measuring 20\u201328 by 6\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm. They are irregular in form; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part, others have irregular branched finger-like protuberances, while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in ''Mycena maculata''. The gill tissue is [[hyaline]] or very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap tissue has a thin [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells, while the remainder is filamentous, and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous-brown in iodine.<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/> The [[mycelium]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' is [[bioluminescent]];<ref name=Treu1990/> this property has not been reported for the fruit bodies.<ref name=Desjardin2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = right\n| image1 = Mycena galericulata 60303.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| caption1 = ''M. galericulata''\n| image2 = Mycena haematopus 56359.jpg\n| width2 =177\n| caption2 = ''M. haematopus''\n}}\nIn the absence of the characteristic reddish staining (particularly in young specimens), ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' is indistinguishable in the field from ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]'', which also tends to grow in groups or [[wikt:tuft|tufts]] on wood.

The group formed in 1992, following a series of live \"jams\" instigated by DJ Dave Carnovale (Crucial D) in collaboration with Damian Robinson and other DJs Scott Pullen and Mark Walton which took place at the Bentley Bar c. 1991 in Sydney's Darlinghurst area. They have released five albums to date. \nOriginally featuring [[reggae]] and [[hip hop]], the group expanded their sound to incorporate elements of [[Soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[funk]] and [[breakbeat|breaks]]. They have been nominated for three [[ARIA Music Awards]] and an Australian Dance Music Award as well as creating dozens of remixes for others.\n\nThe lineup of the group was originally Linda Janssen and MC KYE on vocals, alongside producers Damian Robinson and DJ Dave Carnovale. Over the years many other artists have been included in the lineup of the 'Live' band including Marko Simec (Waiting For Guinness), the late Bruce (Babs) Clarke, well known breaks producer Andy Page, Dave Norris (Nubreed) as well as current performers Gerard Masters, Ian Mussington and Cameron Undy. Dave Carnovale departed the band in 2003 to concentrate on his 'Dubnosis' project and MC Kye departed the band shortly after the release of their fourth album ''4ormation'' in 2005 to work on his Budspells Album. They have headlined their own tours and have supported [[Ben Harper]] and [[The Fugees]]\n\n==Releases==\nThe first single releases, ''Stand Up'', ''Inside'' and ''Summer Sun'' were produced by [[John Prior (musician)|John Prior]] at Unity Gain Studios. ''Stand Up'' was the group's first video, ''Inside'' and ''Summer Sun'' were originally released on Matt Hayward's independent label One Movement, while ''Summer Sun'' was picked up by DJ Andy Glitre and continued to receive high rotation on national radio network [[Triple J]] for several years. The first album release, ''Music From The Core'' was also originally released on One Movement in 1996 and the single \"Local MP\" also achieved high radio rotation. These tracks were featured on the soundtrack to the French film ''[[Clubbed to Death (Lola)]]''. They collaborated with other local artists such as [[Yothu Yindi]], [[Directions in Groove]], [[Deborah Conway]], [[Iva Davies]], [[Christine Anu]] and [[Renee Geyer]].\n\nThe second album, ''Inna Styles'' was released through Mushroom in 2000, followed by an extensive touring schedule. Three singles from the album ''I Don\u2019t Wanna know'', ''Church of Al Green'', and ''Stay With Me Til Dawn'' were again featured on Triple J. The album also featured dancefloor tracks ''Cookin\u2019 with Kazz'' and ''Genie of the Lab''. In 2000 Wicked Beat Sound System received an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]] nomination for ''Inna Styles'' and a Dance Music Award nomination (DMA) for Best Band. They also played festivals across Australia including the [[Perth International Arts Festival]], Vibes On A Summer's Day and the closing of the Sydney Paralympics.\n\nIn 2002 the third album, ''New Soul Breaks'' was released and featured vocal tracks by Janssen including ''I Want To'' and ''Brand New Day'', as well as instrumental tracks ''Do The Tings'' and ''Ounce Of Swing''. In the same year they received another ARIA nomination for ''Best Dance Release''. In 2005 Wicked Beat Sound System released ''4ormation'' featuring the track ''Nightmare''. Shortly after the release of ''4ormation'' MC Kye departed the group to concentrate on his solo project and the group ceased touring for a period of time. In 2006, Wicked Beat Sound System, now largely Robinson and Janssen, recorded ''[[Hydromajestik]]'' which was released on 24 March 2007. More in the vein of their previous ''Inna Styles'' album this album featured vocal tracks in addition to [[dub music|dub]]-influenced instrumentals, the first single was ''Won\u2019t Let Go''.\n\nIn 2008 WBSS released Dreaming album . The Dreaming album was originally a commissioned piece of work written by Damian Robinson. He was approached by Indigenous Artistic director Rhoda Roberts to compose the music for a Cleansing Ceremony she was directing called Sydney Dreaming which was to be a theatrical adaptation of the rainmaker creation story. Since that performance, variations of this music have been performed at several Festivals and Ceremonies including Woodford Festival and Perths International Arts festival. The Dreaming album is the culmination of several years work. The original concept was penned in the heat of a Byron Bay summer and completed in WBs studio in Sydney and then Bungendore. The themes revolve around Salt Water, Fresh Water and Desert, three dividing realities for aboriginal connection to country.\n\nThe '''Dreaming''' Cd was nominated for Aria award in 2009 in the category of \"Best World Music Release\".\n\nReworked variations from this Album were used to make the soundtrack for the Lighting Of The Sydney Opera House Sails for Vivid Festival 2016 along with [https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/visit-us/BaduGili.html Badu Gili] (meaning \u2018water light\u2019 in the language of the traditional owners of Bennelong Point), which accompanies a contemporary aboriginal art projection performed each evening year-round on the western sails of the Sydney opera house.\n\nIn 2017 Robinson was also commissioned to compose the soundtrack for The Parrtjima Festival at Alice Springs.

The group formed in 1992, following a series of live \"jams\" instigated by DJ Dave Carnovale (Crucial D) in collaboration with Damian Robinson and other DJ's Scott Pullen and Mark Walton which took place at the Bentley Bar c. 1991 in Sydney's Darlinghurst area. They have released five albums to date. \nOriginally featuring [[reggae]] and [[hip hop]], the group expanded their sound to incorporate elements of [[Soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[funk]] and [[breakbeat|breaks]]. They have been nominated for three [[ARIA Music Awards]] and an Australian Dance Music Award as well as creating dozens of remixes for others.\n\nThe lineup of the group was originally Linda Janssen and MC KYE on vocals, alongside producers Damian Robinson and DJ Dave Carnovale. Over the years many other artists have been included in the lineup of the 'Live' band including Marko Simec (Waiting For Guinness), the late Bruce (Babs) Clarke, well known breaks producer Andy Page, Dave Norris (Nubreed) as well as current performers Gerard Masters, Ian Mussington and Cameron Undy. Dave Carnovale departed the band in 2003 to concentrate on his 'Dubnosis' project and MC Kye departed the band shortly after the release of their fourth album ''4ormation'' in 2005 to work on his Budspells Album. They have headlined their own tours and have supported [[Ben Harper]] and [[The Fugees]]\n\n==Releases==\nThe first single releases, ''Stand Up'', ''Inside'' and ''Summer Sun'' were produced by [[John Prior (musician)|John Prior]] at Unity Gain Studios. ''Stand Up'' was the group's first video, ''Inside'' and ''Summer Sun'' were originally released on Matt Hayward's independent label One Movement, while ''Summer Sun'' was picked up by DJ Andy Glitre and continued to receive high rotation on national radio network [[Triple J]] for several years. The first album release, ''Music From The Core'' was also originally released on One Movement in 1996 and the single \"Local MP\" also achieved high radio rotation. These tracks were featured on the soundtrack to the French film ''[[Clubbed to Death (Lola)]]''. They collaborated with other local artists such as [[Yothu Yindi]], [[Directions in Groove]], [[Deborah Conway]], [[Iva Davies]], [[Christine Anu]] and [[Renee Geyer]].\n\nThe second album, ''Inna Styles'' was released through Mushroom in 2000, followed by an extensive touring schedule. Three singles from the album ''I Don\u2019t Wanna know'', ''Church of Al Green'', and ''Stay With Me Til Dawn'' were again featured on Triple J. The album also featured dancefloor tracks ''Cookin\u2019 with Kazz'' and ''Genie of the Lab''. In 2000 Wicked Beat Sound System received an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]] nomination for ''Inna Styles'' and a Dance Music Award nomination (DMA) for Best Band. They also played festivals across Australia including the [[Perth International Arts Festival]], Vibes On A Summer's Day and the closing of the Sydney Paralympics.\n\nIn 2002 the third album, ''New Soul Breaks'' was released and featured vocal tracks by Janssen including ''I Want To'' and ''Brand New Day'', as well as instrumental tracks ''Do The Tings'' and ''Ounce Of Swing''. In the same year they received another ARIA nomination for ''Best Dance Release''. In 2005 Wicked Beat Sound System released ''4ormation'' featuring the track ''Nightmare''. Shortly after the release of ''4ormation'' MC Kye departed the group to concentrate on his solo project and the group ceased touring for a period of time. In 2006, Wicked Beat Sound System, now largely Robinson and Janssen, recorded ''[[Hydromajestik]]'' which was released on 24 March 2007. More in the vein of their previous ''Inna Styles'' album this album featured vocal tracks in addition to [[dub music|dub]]-influenced instrumentals, the first single was ''Won\u2019t Let Go''.\n\nIn 2008 WBSS released Dreaming album . The Dreaming album was originally a commissioned piece of work written by Damian Robinson. He was approached by Indigenous Artistic director Rhoda Roberts to compose the music for a Cleansing Ceremony she was directing called Sydney Dreaming which was to be a theatrical adaptation of the rainmaker creation story. Since that performance, variations of this music have been performed at several Festivals and Ceremonies including Woodford Festival and Perths International Arts festival. The Dreaming album is the culmination of several years work. The original concept was penned in the heat of a Byron Bay summer and completed in WBs studio in Sydney and then Bungendore. The themes revolve around Salt Water, Fresh Water and Desert, three dividing realities for aboriginal connection to country.\n\nThe '''Dreaming''' Cd was nominated for Aria award in 2009 in the category of \"Best World Music Release\".\n\nReworked variations from this Album were used to make the soundtrack for the Lighting Of The Sydney Opera House Sails for Vivid Festival 2016 along with [https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/visit-us/BaduGili.html Badu Gili] (meaning \u2018water light\u2019 in the language of the traditional owners of Bennelong Point), which accompanies a contemporary aboriginal art projection performed each evening year-round on the western sails of the Sydney opera house.\n\nIn 2017 Robinson was also commissioned to compose the soundtrack for The Parrtjima Festival at Alice Springs. The festival involved five Aboriginal art centres and showcased the work of 20 Aboriginal artists. Parrtjima (pronounced Par-CHee-ma) means \u2018lighting up\u2019 and conveys two meanings: physically illuminating an object with light and \u2018lighting up\u2019 as in to shed light and understanding on a subject.

A common situation where caustics are visible is when light shines on a drinking glass. The glass casts a shadow, but also produces a curved region of bright light. In ideal circumstances (including perfectly parallel rays, as if from a point source at infinity), a [[nephroid]]-shaped patch of light can be produced.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircleCatacaustic.html Circle Catacaustic].

Some of them even support volumetric caustics. This is accomplished by [[Ray tracing (graphics)|raytracing]] the possible paths of a light beam, accounting for the refraction and reflection.  [[Photon mapping]] is one implementation of this. Volumetric caustics can also be achieved by [[volumetric path tracing]]. Some computer graphic systems work by \"forward ray tracing\" wherein photons are modeled as coming from a light source and bouncing around the environment according to rules. Caustics are formed in the regions where sufficient photons strike a surface causing it to be brighter than the average area in the scene.  \u201cBackward ray tracing\u201d works in the reverse manner beginning at the surface and determining if there is a direct path to the light source.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPU Gems: Programming Techniques, Tips and Tricks for Real-Time Graphics |date=2004 |editor-first=Randima |editor-last=Fernando |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0321228321 |chapter=Chapter 2.

This will lead to a scattered, discontinuous pattern. To tackle this problem, optimal-transport-based is one of the existing proposed methods to control caustic pattern by redirecting light's directions as it propagates through the surface of a certain [[Transparency and translucency|transparent material]]. This is done by solving an inverse optimization problem based on [[Transportation theory (mathematics)|optimal transport]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://lgg.epfl.ch/publications/2014/Caustics/paper.pdf|title=High-contrast Computational Caustic Design|last=Yuliy Schwartzburg, Romain Testuz, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Mark Pauly (2014)|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Optimal Transport, Old and New|last=C\u00e9dric|first=Villani|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-540-71050-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> Given a reference image of an object/pattern, the target is to formulate the mathematical description of the material surface through which light refracts and converges to the similar pattern of the reference image. This is done by rearranging/recomputing the initial light intensity until the minimum of the optimization problem is reached.\n\n==== Design pipeline ====\nHere considering only refractive caustic, the objective can be determined as follows (similar principle for reflective caustic with different output):\n\n''<u>Input:</u>'' image of pattern to be obtained after propagating lights through the material, given the light source position.\n\n<u>''Output:''</u> caustic geometry on the receiver (flat solid surface, e.g.: floor, wall, etc...)\n\nIn order to achieve the target pattern, the surface where light refracts through and exits to the outer environment must be manufactured into certain shape to achieve desired pattern on the other side of the material.\n\nAs mentioned, given an input image, this process will produce the similar caustic pattern as the output. In principle, there are two core stages with each includes two sub-stages:\n\n*[[File:CausOptim.png|thumb|381x381px|Optimal-transport-based caustic design]]Solving Optimal Transport Problem\n*# Compute Target Light Distribution\n*#Compute Mapping from Initial Distribution to Target Distribution\n* Optimizing Target Surface\n*# Compute Normal Representation of Surface\n*# Surface Refinement\n\n==== Solving optimal transport problem ====\nAs the case refraction occurs through a transparent surface, for instance the patterns appearing under clear water surface, 3 main phenomena can be observed:\n\n* Very bright (condensed light intensity) points (so-called [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularity]])\n* Curve-like objects that connect the points\n* Regions with low light intensity\n\nTo perform computation, the following 3 quantities are being respectively introduced to describe the geometric characteristics of the pattern: point singularity <math>\\Phi_{p}</math> (measuring light intensity at certain highly concentrated light-point), curve singularity <math>\\Phi_{c}</math> (measuring light intensity at/around a light-curve), and [[Irradiance|irradiance measure]] <math>\\Phi_{I}</math> (measuring intensity in a certain poorly concentrated light-area). Putting them altogether, the following function defines the total [[Radiant flux|radiant flux measure]] <math>\\Phi_T</math> at a certain section \u03a9 on the target surface:\n\n:<math>\\Phi_T(\\Omega) = \\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\delta} \\Phi_{p}^i(\\Omega) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\gamma} \\Phi_{c}^j(\\Omega) + \\Phi_I(\\Omega)\\displaystyle</math>\n\nAfter this step, there are two existing measures of the radiant flux measures of the source <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> (uniform distribution, by initialization) and the target <math>\\Phi_{T}</math> (computed in previous step). What remains to compute is the mapping from the source to target. In order to do this, there are several quantities to be defined. Firstly, two light intensities evaluated by probabilities: <math>\\mu_S</math> (light intensity evaluated by dividing <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> by the [[flux]] of the union region between <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> and <math>\\Phi_{T}</math>), <math>\\mu_T</math> (light intensity evaluated by dividing <math>\\Phi_{T}</math> by the [[flux]] of the union region between <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> and <math>\\Phi_{T}</math>) are defined. Secondly, the source mesh is generated as multiple sites <math>s_i \\in (\\Phi_S \\cup \\Phi_T)</math>, which is later being deformed. Next, a [[power diagram]] <math>P_w</math> (a set of <math>C_i^w</math> power cells) is defined on this set of sites <math>s_i</math> weighted by a weight vector <math>\\omega</math>. Finally, the goal is to decide whether which power cells are going to be move. Considering all <math>x</math> vertices on the surface, finding the minimizer <math>\\omega_{min}</math> of the following [[convex function]] will produce the matched power diagram for the target:\n\n:<math>f(\\omega) = \\sum_{s_i \\in S} (\\omega_i.\\mu_S(C_i^0) - \\int\\limits_{C_i^{\\omega}} (\\|x - s_i\\|^2 - \\omega_i)d\\mu_T(x))</math>\n\n==== Optimizing target surface ====\n[[File:TarOptim.png|thumb|436x436px|Computation Process]]\nAfter solving optimal transport problem, the vertices are achieved. However, this gives no information about what the final surface should look like. To achieve the desired target surface given the incoming light ray <math>d_I</math>, outgoing light ray <math>d_O</math> and power diagram from the step above, the surface normals representation can be computed according to [[Snell's law]] as:\n\n:<math>n = d_I + {\\eta x \\over \\lVert d_I + \\eta d_T \\rVert} = d_I + {\\eta x \\over \\lVert d_I + \\eta {(x_R - x) \\over || x_R - x ||}\\rVert}</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:<math>\\eta</math>: [[Refractive index|refraction coefficient]]\n\n:<math>x_R</math>: target position obtained from solving above optimal transport problem\n\nAs the normal representation is obtained, surface refinement is then achieved by minimizing the following [[Energy function|compound energy function]]:\n\n:<math>\\underset{x}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\, \\omega \\,  \\cdot[\nE_{int}, \\,\nE_{dir},\\,\nE_{flux}, \\, \nE_{reg}, \\,\nE_{bar}\n]</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:<math>\nE_{int} = \\sum_{v \\in M_T} \\lVert n_o - n\\rVert_2^2</math> is the integration energy that aligns the vertex normals <math>n_o</math> obtained from the Optimal Transport with the target normals <math>n</math> obtained from the Snell's law computation above.\n\n:<math>E_{dir} = \\sum_{v \\in M_T} \\lVert x - \\textbf{proj}_{(x_S, \\,d_I)}(x)\\rVert_2^2</math> as mesh generated in step Solving Optimal Transport cannot adapt to the sharp instances from the discontinuities, this energy is to penalize the vertices to not change significantly from the incoming light ray.\n\n:<math>\nE_{flux} = \\sum_{t \\in M_T} \\lVert \\Phi_T(t) - \\Phi_S(t_s)\\rVert_2^2 \n</math> is the energy measuring the flux over the triangle <math>t</math> in the mesh.\n\n:<math>\nE_{reg} = \\lVert \\textbf{L}\\textbf{X}\\rVert_2^2</math> is the energy that regularizes the shape of the triangles to maintain its well-shapedness.\n\n:<math>\nE_{bar} = \\sum_{v \\in M_T} \\lVert max(0, -log((1 - n_R.(x - x_R)) + d_{TH})\\rVert^2</math> is barrier energy to ensure that surface does not deform beyond a certain distance threshold <math>d_{TH}</math>.\n\n=== Differentiable inverse rendering caustic pattern design ===\n\n==== Basic principle ====\n[[Inverse rendering|Inverse graphics]] is a method to observe the data from image and infer all possible properties including 3D geometry, lighting, materials, and motion, thus generating realistic image.<ref>{{Citation|last=Loper|first=Matthew M.|title=OpenDR: An Approximate Differentiable Renderer|date=2014|work=Computer Vision \u2013 ECCV 2014|pages=154\u2013169|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-10583-3|last2=Black|first2=Michael J.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10584-0_11}}</ref> In conventional computer graphics, to render an image with desired appearance and effects, it is given all the properties/characteristics. This could be considered as the forward process. On the contrary, in caustic design, the properties and characteristics of objects (especially the material surface) are not trivial. The given constraint is the target image to obtain . Therefore, the goal is to get the properties and characteristics by observing and inferring the target image. This can be considered the inverse/backward process. \n\nThe following is the basic [[loss function]] explaining how to optimize the parameters:\n\n:<math>L(c) = \\lVert f(c)-I \\rVert^2</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:{{math|<var>L</var>(<var>c</var>)}}: loss function, mean square error of the rendered image and the target\n\n:{{mvar|c}}: contains elements which can influence the generated image\n\n:{{mvar|I}}: target image\n\n==== Designed pipeline ====\n[[File:Cam-geo-app.png|thumb|546x546px|Differentiable inverse rendering caustic design]]\nAt first, the target pattern is designed and compute the forward pass to get the synthetic pattern. It's compared to the target pattern and get the loss.\nThe objection is to let the synthetic pattern is similar to the target pattern as much as possible. And then do the back propagetion to get the optimized properties need to use in caustic manufacturing.\n\n==== Elements contributing to generated image ====\n\n* Appearance (<math>A</math>): per-pixel surface appearance is modeled as product of [[Mipmap|mipmapped]] texture and per-pixel brightness.\n* Geometry (<math>V</math>): assume a 3D scene to be approximated by triangles, parameterized by vertices <math>V</math>.\n* Camera (<math>C</math>): focal length, the point of view, the center of the camera.\n\nThere could be more elements, for example [[albedo]] and [[Refractive index|refraction coefficient]].\n\n==== General differentiable framework ====\nIntroduce U as an intermediate variable indicating 2D projected vertex coordinate positions. The gradient of these properties can be derived by chain rule indirectly.\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial U} \\times \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}</math>\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A} \\times \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial V}</math>\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial U} \\times \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial C}</math>\n\nAfter applying the [[stochastic gradient descent]], the optimal <math>A</math>, <math>V</math> and <math>C</math> could be achieved. Subsequently, these quantities are used to carve or mill the material to generate the target pattern.\n\n==== Implementation ====\nOne common approach is to utilize the ability to perform differential operations in various [[deep learning]] auto-differentiation frameworks/libraries such as: [[TensorFlow|Tensorflow]], [[PyTorch]], [[Theano (software)|Theano]].\n\nOne more approach is to make use of the OpenDR<ref>{{Citation|last=Loper|first=Matthew M.|title=OpenDR: An Approximate Differentiable Renderer|date=2014|work=Computer Vision \u2013 ECCV 2014|pages=154\u2013169|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-10583-3|last2=Black|first2=Michael J.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10584-0_11}}</ref> framework to build a forward graphics model and to automatically obtain derivatives with respect to the model parameters for optimization. As optimization properties are obtained, the target image can be generated. OpenDR provides a local optimization method that can be incorporated into probabilistic programming frameworks. This can be used to solve the problem of caustic.\n\n== Manufacturing, materials and applications ==\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nAs the caustic pattern has been designed computationally, the processed data will be then sent to manufacturing stage to get final product.

A common situation where caustics are visible is when light shines on a drinking glass. The glass casts a shadow, but also produces a curved region of bright light.

[[Photon mapping]] is one implementation of this. Volumetric caustics can also be achieved by [[volumetric path tracing]]. Some computer graphic systems work by \"forward ray tracing\" wherein photons are modeled as coming from a light source and bouncing around the environment according to rules. Caustics are formed in the regions where sufficient photons strike a surface causing it to be brighter than the average area in the scene.  \u201cBackward ray tracing\u201d works in the reverse manner beginning at the surface and determining if there is a direct path to the light source.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPU Gems: Programming Techniques, Tips and Tricks for Real-Time Graphics |date=2004 |editor-first=Randima |editor-last=Fernando |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0321228321 |chapter=Chapter 2.

This will lead to a scattered, discontinuous pattern. To tackle this problem, optimal-transport-based is one of the existing proposed methods to control caustic pattern by redirecting light's directions as it propagates through the surface of a certain [[Transparency and translucency|transparent material]]. This is done by solving an inverse optimization problem based on [[Transportation theory (mathematics)|optimal transport]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://lgg.epfl.ch/publications/2014/Caustics/paper.pdf|title=High-contrast Computational Caustic Design|last=Yuliy Schwartzburg, Romain Testuz, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Mark Pauly (2014)|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Optimal Transport, Old and New|last=C\u00e9dric|first=Villani|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-540-71050-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> Given a reference image of an object/pattern, the target is to formulate the mathematical description of the material surface through which light refracts and converges to the similar pattern of the reference image.

In principle, there are two core stages with each includes two sub-stages:\n\n*[[File:CausOptim.png|thumb|381x381px|Optimal-transport-based caustic design]]Solving Optimal Transport Problem\n*# Compute Target Light Distribution\n*#Compute Mapping from Initial Distribution to Target Distribution\n* Optimizing Target Surface\n*# Compute Normal Representation of Surface\n*# Surface Refinement\n\n==== Solving optimal transport problem ====\nAs the case refraction occurs through a transparent surface, for instance the patterns appearing under clear water surface, 3 main phenomena can be observed:\n\n* Very bright (condensed light intensity) points (so-called [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularity]])\n* Curve-like objects that connect the points\n* Regions with low light intensity\n\nTo perform computation, the following 3 quantities are being respectively introduced to describe the geometric characteristics of the pattern: point singularity <math>\\Phi_{p}</math> (measuring light intensity at certain highly concentrated light-point), curve singularity <math>\\Phi_{c}</math> (measuring light intensity at/around a light-curve), and [[Irradiance|irradiance measure]] <math>\\Phi_{I}</math> (measuring intensity in a certain poorly concentrated light-area). Putting them altogether, the following function defines the total [[Radiant flux|radiant flux measure]] <math>\\Phi_T</math> at a certain section \u03a9 on the target surface:\n\n:<math>\\Phi_T(\\Omega) = \\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\delta} \\Phi_{p}^i(\\Omega) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\gamma} \\Phi_{c}^j(\\Omega) + \\Phi_I(\\Omega)\\displaystyle</math>\n\nAfter this step, there are two existing measures of the radiant flux measures of the source <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> (uniform distribution, by initialization) and the target <math>\\Phi_{T}</math> (computed in previous step). What remains to compute is the mapping from the source to target. In order to do this, there are several quantities to be defined. Firstly, two light intensities evaluated by probabilities: <math>\\mu_S</math> (light intensity evaluated by dividing <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> by the [[flux]] of the union region between <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> and <math>\\Phi_{T}</math>), <math>\\mu_T</math> (light intensity evaluated by dividing <math>\\Phi_{T}</math> by the [[flux]] of the union region between <math>\\Phi_{S}</math> and <math>\\Phi_{T}</math>) are defined. Secondly, the source mesh is generated as multiple sites <math>s_i \\in (\\Phi_S \\cup \\Phi_T)</math>, which is later being deformed. Next, a [[power diagram]] <math>P_w</math> (a set of <math>C_i^w</math> power cells) is defined on this set of sites <math>s_i</math> weighted by a weight vector <math>\\omega</math>. Finally, the goal is to decide whether which power cells are going to be move. Considering all <math>x</math> vertices on the surface, finding the minimizer <math>\\omega_{min}</math> of the following [[convex function]] will produce the matched power diagram for the target:\n\n:<math>f(\\omega) = \\sum_{s_i \\in S} (\\omega_i.\\mu_S(C_i^0) - \\int\\limits_{C_i^{\\omega}} (\\|x - s_i\\|^2 - \\omega_i)d\\mu_T(x))</math>\n\n==== Optimizing target surface ====\n[[File:TarOptim.png|thumb|436x436px|Computation Process]]\nAfter solving optimal transport problem, the vertices are achieved. However, this gives no information about what the final surface should look like. To achieve the desired target surface given the incoming light ray <math>d_I</math>, outgoing light ray <math>d_O</math> and power diagram from the step above, the surface normals representation can be computed according to [[Snell's law]] as:\n\n:<math>n = d_I + {\\eta x \\over \\lVert d_I + \\eta d_T \\rVert} = d_I + {\\eta x \\over \\lVert d_I + \\eta {(x_R - x) \\over || x_R - x ||}\\rVert}</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:<math>\\eta</math>: [[Refractive index|refraction coefficient]]\n\n:<math>x_R</math>: target position obtained from solving above optimal transport problem\n\nAs the normal representation is obtained, surface refinement is then achieved by minimizing the following [[Energy function|compound energy function]]:\n\n:<math>\\underset{x}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\, \\omega \\,  \\cdot[\nE_{int}, \\,\nE_{dir},\\,\nE_{flux}, \\, \nE_{reg}, \\,\nE_{bar}\n]</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:<math>\nE_{int} = \\sum_{v \\in M_T} \\lVert n_o - n\\rVert_2^2</math> is the integration energy that aligns the vertex normals <math>n_o</math> obtained from the Optimal Transport with the target normals <math>n</math> obtained from the Snell's law computation above.\n\n:<math>E_{dir} = \\sum_{v \\in M_T} \\lVert x - \\textbf{proj}_{(x_S, \\,d_I)}(x)\\rVert_2^2</math> as mesh generated in step Solving Optimal Transport cannot adapt to the sharp instances from the discontinuities, this energy is to penalize the vertices to not change significantly from the incoming light ray.\n\n:<math>\nE_{flux} = \\sum_{t \\in M_T} \\lVert \\Phi_T(t) - \\Phi_S(t_s)\\rVert_2^2 \n</math> is the energy measuring the flux over the triangle <math>t</math> in the mesh.\n\n:<math>\nE_{reg} = \\lVert \\textbf{L}\\textbf{X}\\rVert_2^2</math> is the energy that regularizes the shape of the triangles to maintain its well-shapedness.\n\n:<math>\nE_{bar} = \\sum_{v \\in M_T} \\lVert max(0, -log((1 - n_R.(x - x_R)) + d_{TH})\\rVert^2</math> is barrier energy to ensure that surface does not deform beyond a certain distance threshold <math>d_{TH}</math>.\n\n=== Differentiable inverse rendering caustic pattern design ===\n\n==== Basic principle ====\n[[Inverse rendering|Inverse graphics]] is a method to observe the data from image and infer all possible properties including 3D geometry, lighting, materials, and motion, thus generating realistic image.<ref>{{Citation|last=Loper|first=Matthew M.|title=OpenDR: An Approximate Differentiable Renderer|date=2014|work=Computer Vision \u2013 ECCV 2014|pages=154\u2013169|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-10583-3|last2=Black|first2=Michael J.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10584-0_11}}</ref> In conventional computer graphics, to render an image with desired appearance and effects, it is given all the properties/characteristics. This could be considered as the forward process. On the contrary, in caustic design, the properties and characteristics of objects (especially the material surface) are not trivial. The given constraint is the target image to obtain . Therefore, the goal is to get the properties and characteristics by observing and inferring the target image. This can be considered the inverse/backward process. \n\nThe following is the basic [[loss function]] explaining how to optimize the parameters:\n\n:<math>L(c) = \\lVert f(c)-I \\rVert^2</math>\n\nwhere,\n\n:{{math|<var>L</var>(<var>c</var>)}}: loss function, mean square error of the rendered image and the target\n\n:{{mvar|c}}: contains elements which can influence the generated image\n\n:{{mvar|I}}: target image\n\n==== Designed pipeline ====\n[[File:Cam-geo-app.png|thumb|546x546px|Differentiable inverse rendering caustic design]]\nAt first, the target pattern is designed and compute the forward pass to get the synthetic pattern. It's compared to the target pattern and get the loss.\nThe objection is to let the synthetic pattern is similar to the target pattern as much as possible. And then do the back propagetion to get the optimized properties need to use in caustic manufacturing.\n\n==== Elements contributing to generated image ====\n\n* Appearance (<math>A</math>): per-pixel surface appearance is modeled as product of [[Mipmap|mipmapped]] texture and per-pixel brightness.\n* Geometry (<math>V</math>): assume a 3D scene to be approximated by triangles, parameterized by vertices <math>V</math>.\n* Camera (<math>C</math>): focal length, the point of view, the center of the camera.\n\nThere could be more elements, for example [[albedo]] and [[Refractive index|refraction coefficient]].\n\n==== General differentiable framework ====\nIntroduce U as an intermediate variable indicating 2D projected vertex coordinate positions. The gradient of these properties can be derived by chain rule indirectly.\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial U} \\times \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}</math>\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A} \\times \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial V}</math>\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial U} \\times \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial C}</math>\n\nAfter applying the [[stochastic gradient descent]], the optimal <math>A</math>, <math>V</math> and <math>C</math> could be achieved. Subsequently, these quantities are used to carve or mill the material to generate the target pattern.\n\n==== Implementation ====\nOne common approach is to utilize the ability to perform differential operations in various [[Deep learning|Deep Learning]] auto-differentiation frameworks/libraries such as: [[TensorFlow|Tensorflow]], [[PyTorch]], [[Theano (software)|Theano]].\n\nOne more approach is to make use of the OpenDR<ref>{{Citation|last=Loper|first=Matthew M.|title=OpenDR: An Approximate Differentiable Renderer|date=2014|work=Computer Vision \u2013 ECCV 2014|pages=154\u2013169|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-10583-3|last2=Black|first2=Michael J.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10584-0_11}}</ref> framework to build a forward graphics model and to automatically obtain derivatives with respect to the model parameters for optimization. As optimization properties are obtained, the target image can be generated. OpenDR provides a local optimization method that can be incorporated into probabilistic programming frameworks. This can be used to solve the problem of caustic.\n\n=== Per-pixel discrete caustic pattern design ===\n\n==== Basic Principle ====\nPer-pixel manipulation can generate a diverse array of artistic images. In discrete caustic design, each pixel can be absorbed and redirected light in different position so that can be generated different patterns. Each pixel is considered to be \"a stick\" and it can be replaced or rotated to redirect the light in different positions, generating the target image. However, mimicking this process is too time-consuming to generate some complicated patterns since there are millions of combinations for these sticks. In order to achieve the goal more easily, it is necessary to determine the layout of the sticks in such a way that the light is redirected by the sticks to form the target caustic geometry on the receiver.[[File:Pixel art in caustic.png|thumb|[http://nishitalab.org/user/egaku/eg12/yue-rearrangeable-lens-sticks.pdf Cautisc in Pixel Art]]][[File:Rotation in different angle.png|thumb|[http://nishitalab.org/user/egaku/eg12/yue-rearrangeable-lens-sticks.pdf Each stick can redirect light in four directions]]]\n\n==== Constraints ====\nThe binary variable <math>A_{i, \\,j, \\,k} = {0 \\ or \\ 1}</math> represents all of the possible placement of the sticks. The integer <math>i = 1...N_T</math> denotes the type of the stick and <math>N_T</math> is the number of types. Different types of material have different [[Snell's law|refracted index]], which means that light would be refracted in different angles. In <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yue|first=Yonghao|last2=Iwasaki|first2=Kei|last3=Chen|first3=Bing-Yu|last4=Dobashi|first4=Yoshinori|last5=Nishita|first5=Tomoyuki|date=2012|title=Pixel Art with Refracted Light by Rearrangeable Sticks|journal=Computer Graphics Forum|language=en|volume=31|issue=2pt3|pages=575\u2013582|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03036.x|issn=1467-8659}}</ref>, the material is only [[Acrylic resin|acrylate resin]]. The integer <math>j = 1,\\, 2,\\, 3, \\, 4</math> denotes the rotated orientation. Each stick can be rotated in four directions <math>{0^\\circ , 90^\\circ , 180^\\circ , 270^\\circ}</math>. Therefore, for a specific stick, the light can be refracted in four positions. The integer <math>k = 1...N_P</math> denotes the position of stick and <math>N_P</math> is the number of pixel.\n\n<math>s_x</math> and <math>s_y</math>  denote as described above instead of <math>i</math>, and <math>p_x</math> and <math>p_y</math> instead of <math>k</math>. And the color of desired pattern at the position <math>(q_x, \\, q_y)</math> denotes as <math>c(q_x, \\, q_y)</math>. In practice, there would be some variations from the desired light. Therefore, it is able to represent the amount of these variations by using variable <math>n(q_x, \\, q_y)</math>. The following constraint is considered:\n\n<math>\\sum_{s_{x,j}+p_x=q_x \\  \\ s_{y,j}+p_y=q_y}A_{(s_x,s_y),j,(p_x,p_y)}=c(q_x,q_y)+n(q_x,q_y)</math>\n\nBecause the intensity of the pixels on the screen should not be negative, the third constraint must be satisfied as:\n\n<math>\\ c(q_x,q_y)+n(q_x,q_y) </math> \u2265 0\n\n==== Objective Function ====\nThe goal is to make the noise small and smooth. Therefore, minimizing the sum of variation and the gradient ensures the minimal noise without fluctuating significantly. The objective function is formulated as:\n\n<math> \\underset{A_{i,j,k}; n_{q_x,q_y}}{\\operatorname{arg\\,min}}\\,\nw_a\\sum_{q_x,q_y}n^2(q_x,q_y) + w_b \\sum_{q_x,q_y}| \\nabla n(q_x,q_y)|^2 </math>\n\nThe sticks can be rearranged with respect to the optimal parameters to form the target geometry.\n\n== Manufacturing, materials and applications ==\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nAs the caustic pattern has been designed computationally, the processed data will be then sent to manufacturing stage to get final product. The most common approach is subtractive manufacturing.\n[[File:Diffren.png|thumb|483x483px|Design and manufacturing process|alt=]]\n<br />\n\n=== Materials ===\nIn general, the caustic pattern principles can apply to any refractive (or reflective) materials and this is mostly done by [[machining]] methods (i.e.: subtractive manufacturing).
