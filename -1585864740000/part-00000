However, he is troubled by religious unrest in his own kingdom, as well as by political struggles and changing allegiances with other countries. Weighing most on his mind is his failure thus far to produce a male heir with his Queen, Katherine of Aragon, a pious and dutiful Queen who is popular with the people. He does, however, dote on his daughter Mary, whom he hopes to marry off to a European ruler. The difficult pursuit of a [[divorce]] approved by the [[Pope]] begins when Henry meets, falls in love with, and later seduces Anne Boleyn. Determined that Anne will be his wife and will provide him with a legitimate son, Henry separates himself from his wife and the Catholic faith causing friction with the pope and a clash of religious opinions. The series portrays Henry as having a major turning point in his marriage to Katherine after a near-death experience in the early 1520s, after which he becomes obsessed with trying to produce a male heir.\n\nWhen he fails in his attempts to have a son with her, he is quick to lay the blame at Anne's door and then by chance meets Jane Seymour, a sweet, shy girl, and falls in love with her. Convinced that his future lies with Jane, Henry takes the chance to be rid of Anne when his longtime friend Charles Brandon tells him of rumors suggesting that she has been unfaithful. Anne is quickly brought to trial, found guilty and executed.\n\nAlthough Henry's personal life improves with his marriage to Jane Seymour, who helps reunite him with his daughters, his position is threatened when Catholics in the north start to rebel against him. He crushes the rebellion and brutally punishes those involved. Finally Henry's wish comes true when Jane gives him the one thing that his last two wives could not: a son. But Jane falls sick and dies from childbed fever a few days later, leaving Henry in a deep state of depression.\n\nHe remains a widower for three years until Thomas Cromwell pushes him into a fourth marriage with the German Anne of Cleves. He agrees to wed her but is disgusted by her when he finally meets her. Unable to escape the betrothal, he marries Anne but starts divorce proceedings soon after. He then notices the extremely young Catherine Howard and decides to marry her because she makes him feel young again. Catherine Howard is executed once her hidden past relations with Francis Dereham and her adulterous affair with Thomas Culpeper came to light. Henry later marries his sixth and final wife, Catherine Parr, a wealthy widow closer to Henry's age. She is a loving wife and stepmother to all three of Henry's children and is made Queen Regent during Henry's absence at [[Boulogne]]. Bishop Gardiner and others suspect Catherine Parr of heresy and nearly have her arrested for it, but she is able to convince Henry of her devotion to him.\n\nIn 1536, while participating in a joust, Henry suffered a grievous leg wound that never healed properly and gave him pain the rest of his life. It also prevented him from being as active as he had been, and he became morbidly obese in the last years of his life. His increasing pain and approaching infirmity makes it doubtful the King can participate in the invasion of France in alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor. However, he rouses himself and leads the successful siege of Boulogne in 1544. In the fall of that year, he returns to England, where his health declines until his death in January 1547.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Cardinal Wolsey}} '''Cardinal Wolsey'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Sam Neill]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Wolsey]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Cardinal Thomas Wolsey of York is King Henry VIII's primary and most trusted adviser, but the Cardinal's personal power (and influence over the King) has aroused the ire of several noblemen in Henry's court, and even of Queen Katherine herself. He desperately tries to find a way for Henry to free himself of his marriage, but fails and his enemies pounce. He is subsequently arrested for treason against the King and commits suicide by slashing his neck during prayer.(historically he died of natural causes whilst en route from York to London to face trial). His name is mentioned again in the seventh episode of season two by Anne, alluding to his charitable work when she reprimands Cromwell for being greedy with assets taken from dissolved abbeys.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Anthony Knivet}} '''Sir Anthony Knivet'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Callum Blue]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Knyvett]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Longtime friend to King Henry VIII; he only appears in the first season.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Charles Brandon}} '''Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Henry Cavill]] (2007\u20132010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 4.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | A longtime friend to King Henry VIII, Brandon briefly falls out of favour when he secretly married Henry's widowed sister, Princess Margaret, after her brief term as Queen of Portugal. Brandon's infidelity makes the marriage an unhappy one. He becomes an ally of the Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Boleyn, to bring about the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey and to ensure his own return to court. After the removal of Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor, Brandon is appointed to the presidency of the Privy Council by Henry. After his promotion he shows little interest in the work of government leaving this responsibility to the Duke of Norfolk with whom he jointly shares the duties as president. Brandon is seen as a playboy in the show's first season, but as Duke of Suffolk becomes a mature courtier and magnate after marrying Catherine Willoughby in the second season. He hates the new queen and eventually quarrels with the Boleyn family, mainly directing his rage at his onetime ally, Thomas Boleyn. In the third season, Brandon is a reluctant but efficient leader of the King's forces, sent to ruthlessly repress a Catholic uprising. He is jealous of Thomas Cromwell, working to ensure his fall from office. In the third and fourth seasons, Brandon senses the increasing disdain that his second wife feels for his flawed character. In the final season he falls in love with Brigitte Rousselot, a young French woman he captured during the [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u201346)|siege of Boulogne]] and takes her back to England.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Duke of Norfolk}} '''Duke of Norfolk'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Henry Czerny]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Uncle of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII's fifth wife, Catherine Howard. Norfolk is represented as an arrogant intriguer, conscious of his noble rank and arch-enemy of Cardinal Wolsey. He and his brother-in-law Thomas Boleyn conspire to maneuver his niece, Anne Boleyn, into Henry's bed in order to gain influence over him and to advance their own interests. Together with Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, they engineer Wolsey's overthrow and then his arrest (and indirectly, his subsequent death). Norfolk is subsequently jointly appointed with Suffolk to the presidency of the Privy Council. Norfolk does not appear in seasons 2, 3 or 4, although, in actual history, he was still alive and played a significant role in the events which transpired in those series; [[Catherine Howard]] was a closer relation to him than portrayed in season 3. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Anne Boleyn}} '''Anne Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Natalie Dormer]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Anne Boleyn]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10{{br}}(4.10 Dream Sequence)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Daughter of Thomas Boleyn, and sister of George and Mary Boleyn. Anne was sent to be a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine, as a pawn of her father's and her uncle's schemes to ruin Cardinal Wolsey. She attracted Henry VIII's attention at the masquerade where she, along with Henry's sister Margaret, played two of the Graces. By her father's orders, she continually put herself in Henry's way, till Henry was so enamoured of her that he vowed he would take her as his only mistress if she would give herself to him. Anne, remembering how her sister was thrown aside after Henry tired of her, refused him, saying that she was saving her virginity for her eventual husband, causing Henry, already at odds with Queen Katherine for failing to produce a living son, to consider annulment or divorce. She admits to her father that while she did not like the role of sacrificial lamb at first, she was growing to love Henry. At first the relationship was a secret, but more and more Henry honored her as his consort rather than Katherine. The delay of the annulment proceedings frustrated Henry, and Anne used this opportunity to blame Wolsey for the delay, leaving him when she felt that the proceedings will never come to fruition. She also gradually turned him in favor of Protestantism so that, as head of the church in his realm, he could finally divorce Katherine without referring to the Roman Church.\n\nThe second season sees Anne reach the peak of her power. She is created as Marquess of Pembroke and is taken to France to meet the French King, Francis, as the future Queen and sleeps with Henry and thus conceives a child who she is confident will be a boy.  Soon afterwards, Henry marries Anne and crowns her as Queen, his marriage to Catherine annulled by Cranmer; however, Anne and Henry's hopes are dashed when she gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, which sets in motion the Act of Succession. She is more or less manipulated by her father to do everything to win Henry's love (which becomes evident after her miscarriage of her second child). She allows Henry to disinherit his daughter Mary but tries to establish ties with her on the condition that Mary accept her as queen \u2013 Mary rebuffs this offer.\n\nAnne becomes desperate to conceive a son, but miscarries twice after Elizabeth and is eventually accused of witchcraft and adultery.  Henry removes Elizabeth from the line of succession, convinced she is not his daughter, and sentences Anne to execution by beheading, which she goes to with dignity and surprising admiration from the people.  Anne re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Elizabeth, expressing pride for her daughter, proclaiming her innocence that the crimes she was killed for, and showing sympathy for her deceased cousin Catherine Howard.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Katherine of Aragon}} '''Katherine of Aragon'''<ref name=\"Spelling\">As established by the series credits and [http://www.sho.com/site/tudors/characters.do character list on the official website] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628235856/http://www.sho.com/site/tudors/characters.do |date=2009-06-28 }}, the character's name is spelled Katherine with a \"K\" in contrast to the [[English language]] spelling \"Catherine\" usually used for the actual historical figure.</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07{{br}}(4.10 Dream Sequence)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Youngest child of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, Katherine is the first wife and [[queen consort]] of Henry VIII. She was once married to Henry's older brother, Arthur, but claims that that marriage was never consummated. Most of her children with Henry VIII were either miscarried or died in infancy; her one surviving child was her daughter, Princess Mary.\n\nBecause of her seeming inability to give him a son, along with the onset of [[menopause]], Henry worries that England might face a reversion to civil war in the event of his death. With the [[Wars of the Roses]] still a recent memory, he was determined to have a legitimate son to whom to pass his throne. He therefore preferred to believe that Katherine lied when she swore that her previous marriage was never consummated and that therefore his marriage to her was [[incest]]uous and illegal. Katherine was very lonely at court, her only friend was the ambassador of Spain, as Cardinal Wolsey dismissed her Spanish ladies-in-waiting for fear that they were spies for the Holy Roman Emperor. Nevertheless, she always does her duty as Queen of England admirably, even mingling with and donating to the common people after church services, and she is loved by the English people despite her Spanish background. She is banished to spend her final days at the house \"The More\", without any contact from the king's staff or her daughter Mary. She is last seen dictating her will on her deathbed, read both aloud and, intercutting with, by a mournful Henry VIII; Anne smiles upon hearing the news and states that \"Now, I am indeed queen.\" Katherine re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Mary, confronting Henry about his treatment of her daughter and her own status as his 'true wife'. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Boleyn}} '''Thomas Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Nick Dunning]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Father of George, Mary, and Anne Boleyn, and brother-in-law to the Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn appears initially as the English ambassador to France, who sees his daughters primarily as a means to advance family interests. To this end, he encourages Mary to become Henry's mistress and, subsequently, Anne to aim for the higher status of a royal marriage. Together with Norfolk and Suffolk, Boleyn engineers Cardinal Wolsey's downfall. He then becomes a leading member of the Royal Council, although somewhat subordinate to his two fellow plotters in jointly handling the country's affairs. In the second season, Boleyn starts to worry that Anne is losing the king's love and urges her to keep him at her side, even telling her to 'offer him a gift', one of her ladies-in-waiting as a mistress. He is later faced with Anne's fear of the Seymour family but this only catches his attention when his ally, Thomas Cromwell, offers his quarters to them at the King's request. Following Cromwell's investigation of rumors of treason committed by Anne, Boleyn is arrested along with others, but is reprieved by the King and exiled from court. He is berated by Charles Brandon in the last episode of Season 2 for his selfishness and his evident relief that he will live while his son and daughter will die. In the Season 4 episode \"''A Moment of Nostalgia''\" Brandon mentions that Boleyn has died recently with only the ghosts of his children in attendance at the funeral.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas More}} '''Thomas More'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Jeremy Northam]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas More]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Longtime friend of Henry VIII, Sir Thomas is a pious Christian who abhors war and tried to advise Henry against it. He nevertheless believes that stern action is required to combat the rise of Lutheranism. During his time as Lord Chancellor after Wolsey, More burns to death six people found guilty of heresy, although he offers them the chance to recant. After it becomes apparent that the king was also changing his attitude towards Catholicism, he becomes worried, finally recalling that Wolsey once told him that he should have told the king what he ought to do, not what he can do, for \"if the lion knows his own strength, no man could control him\". More is married with four children. In the second season More avoids taking any public position over the king's \"great matter\" of divorce from Catherine, but is finally condemned and executed after refusing to take an oath recognizing Henry as supreme head of the English Church.  He is condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered but Henry, out of respect, reduces the execution to a quick beheading. Henry shows deep regret over More's death. \n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Cromwell}} '''Thomas Cromwell'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[James Frain]] (2007\u20132009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.04<!-- NOTE: Not main cast credited until episode #1.04 -->\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.08\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Although Thomas Cromwell was elevated by Cardinal Wolsey after the king's secretary was removed (see Richard Pace, below), he was secretly the ally of the Boleyn family. He is also represented as the man who introduces Anne Boleyn to [[Lutheranism]], which she subsequently introduced to Henry VIII. In the second season, Cromwell rises to the position of chief minister after the fall of Thomas More. Although More is later beheaded for refusing to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church in England, Cromwell takes a sympathetic approach towards him, as he deeply admires More; he also orders swift and necessary action when allegations arise regarding Queen Anne Boleyn (which leads to her ultimate downfall).  A characteristic of Cromwell is that, although he is untrustworthy to anyone but the King and is no-one's true friend, he always gives potential opponents a fair warning and a neutral, unbiased viewpoint; while guarded about his own opinions, he is not hesitant to show genuine admiration when he feels it. In this, he is very like Thomas More (though Cromwell is a Protestant reformer and More was a devout Catholic) but is much more unscrupulous with his actions.\n\nCromwell is depicted as being ruthless and calculating, but also as a hard-working and extremely able minister; he is Wolsey's true successor as the King's right hand. His historic role as a talented administrator and reformer eventually comes into conflict with Henry's ambiguous commitment to the Reformation; the series portrays Cromwell as a committed Protestant who sees the Reformation slipping away, with the Church of England, despite its break from Rome, retaining Catholic tradition and ritual. An attempt to strengthen the King's ties to Protestantism through a German marriage to Anne of Cleves (though couched as a political alliance) backfires. Because of his commoner origins Cromwell is resented by nobles such as the Duke of Suffolk and frequently abused even by Henry. His beheading is a botched affair because the executioner is drunk.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Wyatt}} '''Thomas Wyatt'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Jamie King (actor)|Jamie King]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03<!-- NOTE: Not main cast credited until episode #2.01 -->\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The former love of Anne Boleyn, poet Thomas Wyatt befriends and collaborates with composer Thomas Tallis while both are on a trip to [[France]] with Cardinal Wolsey. He claims to have had carnal relations with Anne, although this is at odds with Anne saying that her maidenhead was only for her husband to claim. He makes few appearances in the first season, but appears frequently in the second. He still holds and proclaims his feelings for Anne even though she has married the King. Wyatt is arrested and charged with betraying Henry, but is released in time to see Anne's execution. He notes the irony that of the accused lovers, he is the only one who is actually guilty and the only one who survived.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Cranmer}} '''Thomas Cranmer'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Hans Matheson]] (2008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Cranmer]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was involved in handing the dispute over Henry's marriage of Katherine of Aragon as being \"null and void\" and recognize Anne Boleyn as the new queen, having everybody swear an oath to recognize their new queen. He was introduced as a nervous man when Thomas Cromwell introduced him to the king. When he became the new Archbishop, he gained more confidence and took decisions to move against Katherine and reform the Church in England. He was portrayed from then on as cold and harsh but devoted. A determined Protestant reformer, he resented traditionalist men like Thomas More and Bishop Fisher and, despite their years of loyal service to the king, he branded them as traitors.\n\nHe is deeply loyal and devoted to Anne Boleyn but, despite his devotion to her, he is forced to relinquish the mutual desire for a reformed faith when Anne falls from favour. He takes her last confession in the Tower and breaks the news to her that Elizabeth is to be declared illegitimate but promises her that he will endeavour to keep her in the King's \"good and kind graces\". Historically Cranmer lived until Henry's daughter Mary inherited the throne, when she, a staunch catholic, had him executed for his Protestant beliefs.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Paul III}} '''Pope Paul III'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Peter O'Toole]] (2008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Pope Paul III]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church who declares Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn invalid and with ex-communicates Henry. Portrayed as a skilled politician with a dry sense of humour, Pope Paul sends a \"Soldier in Christ\" to assassinate the new queen, with the promise that he will gain access into heaven no matter if it succeeds or fails. Paul is outraged by and denounces the executions of both Bishop Fisher and Thomas More. He has no qualms about using force when necessary but is also portrayed as a loving man who considers the Catholics his children and wants to protect them like a father would protect his child. This is shown, for example, when Paul signs a [[Sublimis Deus|document prohibiting the enslavement of the peoples of the New World]]. He remarks - rather pompously- that he must act as the conscience of the Kings of Europe. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Jane Seymour}} '''Jane Seymour'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Anita Briem]] (2008){{br}}[[Annabelle Wallis]] (2009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Jane Seymour]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07 (Briem){{br}}Episode 3.01 (Wallis)\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10 (Briem){{br}}Episode 3.04 (Wallis){{br}}(4.10 Dream Sequence)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Becoming less interested in his new wife Anne Boleyn with her failure to produce a male heir, King Henry VIII has Jane Seymour made one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting in an attempt to seduce her. Jane, mindful of her reputation and following her brother's advice, refuses Henry's gifts and advances, impressing the king with her modesty. A romance develops between Henry and Jane as his marriage to Anne further deteriorates; when Anne catches Henry kissing Jane, she flies into a rage and miscarries a son. Henry orchestrates Anne's arrest for adultery, moving Jane into her quarters and unofficially proposing marriage. Henry and Jane become engaged on the same day as Anne's execution and get married just 10 days later. As an increasingly popular Queen, Jane promotes Mary's interests and secures her position back at court. She also appeals to Henry to restore the monasteries on behalf of the Catholics but she is quickly rebuked by him for meddling in his affairs. Unlike the doomed Anne, she heeds his warning and pursues her agendas within the restrictions of her gender and position. Jane reunites Henry with both his daughters over Christmastide to everybody's delight. Her position as Queen is cemented when she gives birth to Henry's son, Edward. However the birth is long and difficult and she dies twelve days after from childbed fever, leaving Henry devastated as he falls into a deep depression from his grief. Henry regards Jane as his true love because of her kind nature and the fact that she gave him a son. She is given a Queen's burial and Henry promises that one day they will be with each other again when he is buried beside her. Jane re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Edward, furious that Edward has been treated badly and will die at a very young age, frightening Henry. When Wallis took over the role for the third season, most of Briem's scenes were re-filmed for the recap in the season opener.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Francis Bryan}} '''Sir Francis Bryan'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Alan van Sprang]] (2009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Francis Bryan]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.08\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Bryan is a spy, agent, reputed assassin, and an accomplished [[Cryptography|cryptographer]].

Bryan takes an instant attraction to the fictional character Lady Ursula Misseldon and quickly becomes her lover. Although initially ready to act as an agent for Thomas Cromwell in attempting to intimidate Princess Mary, Bryan turns against the disgraced Minister and by getting his executioner drunk is able to ensure that Cromwell's death is a cruel one. He is sent by Henry to France and Italy to murder Cardinal Reginald Pole but fails in this mission.  \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Robert Aske}} '''Robert Aske'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Gerard McSorley]] (2009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.04\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Aske is a [[Yorkshire]] lawyer who opposes the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] and becomes the leader of the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] - a rising in northern England.

However the king is not attracted to her, famously saying \"I like her not!\", and the marriage is annulled less than a year later. Having the benefit of Katherine of Aragon's, Anne Boleyn's, and Jane Seymour's experiences to study, or perhaps simply as eager for an escape route as Henry, she wisely accepts the king's decision, and is rewarded with a pension and lands. She was referred to as \"the King's Beloved Sister\" and remained well liked by the King's daughters, who continued to visit her after the annulment.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Catherine Howard}} '''Catherine Howard'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Tamzin Merchant]] (2009\u20132010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Catherine Howard]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.08<!-- Main cast credited as of episode 4.01 -->\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 4.05 \n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Henry's fifth wife, Catherine came to court to serve as lady-in-waiting to Anne of Cleves before catching the King's eye.

Mary's early years were full of happiness, receiving love and adoration from both her parents, and was once betrothed to the [[Dauphin of France]], her cousin, Charles V of Spain, and Francis I's youngest son, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. Initially, Mary remained unaware of her parents failing marriage, though gradually she became increasingly aware of the situation; starting when her illegitimate half-brother received titles and his own household, and she too received a household of her own, but far away in the [[Welsh Marches]] and under the care of her governess; Lady Salisbury. Mary's place in succession was lost when her parents' marriage was annulled, and so Mary was referred to as \"Lady Mary\", and any and all contact with her mother was forbidden (much to her pain; as she was not present when she died of illness). Ultimately, her father severed all ties with her when her half-sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] was born, and so Mary was formally expelled from court, her servants dismissed from her service, and she was forced to serve as a [[lady-in-waiting]], while Elizabeth received Mary's place in the succession. Mary is relieved not only when her future stepmother, Jane Seymour, made efforts to befriend with her and revealed her hopes to restore her to the succession, but also to hear of Anne Boleyn's execution. Mary was allowed back to court when she (very reluctantly) signed a document that formally declared her allegiance to her father and acknowledgement as him being the Head of the Church; relinquishing her own Catholic faith in the process (something she agonized over). Henry had threatened to put her to death if she had refused, but upon seeing Mary for the first time in years, immediately regretted all his actions and welcomed her back. Mary was initially furious over the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Anne of Cleves becoming the new queen, but warmed to her considerably upon meeting Catherine Howard, her frivolous, immature replacement. Following Catherine's execution, Mary renewed her friendship with Catherine Parr, the Lady Latimer (historically, Parr was Katherine of Aragon's goddaughter, though this was not mentioned in the series), and was initially pleased at her father's interest and subsequent marriage to her. Mary's attitude hardened upon realizing that Parr was Protestant, however. This discovery, which coincides with the departure of her friend and father-figure Eustace Chapuys, the Imperial Ambassador, causes Mary to finally snap and reveal the true depths of her fanaticism.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Edward Seymour}} '''Edward Seymour'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Max Brown (actor)|Max Brown]] (2008\u20132010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.08\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 4.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Brother of Jane Seymour, he is quickly elevated as Jane gained the King's favour.

In Episode 1.04, Compton is knighted Sir William Compton, alongside Knivert, for no more apparent reason than having amused the King by substituting a small log for a lance while jousting. The new Sir William is portrayed throughout the series as a witty and elegant courtier who avoids the occasional blunders of his two friends Brandon and Knivert. Compton, though married, soon shows a romantic homosexual interest in the young composer [[Thomas Tallis (The Tudors)|Thomas Tallis]] in Episode 1.05. At first Tallis refuses Compton's advances, but does not pull away when Compton kisses him; later they are shown in bed together.

After his first choice dies he marries the second. In a rare supernatural element in the series the dead sister watches Tallis and his new wife in bed together. Though he does not appear in subsequent seasons, Tallis continued to prosper throughout the period, and received the favor of Elizabeth I.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Mary Boleyn}} '''Mary Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Perdita Weeks]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Mary Boleyn]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Daughter of Thomas Boleyn and sister to George and Anne Boleyn.

He refuses, and she is further irritated that he has chosen his common-born friend Charles Brandon to accompany her to Portugal and present her to her future husband.  Margaret pressures Henry to agree that, once her husband is dead, she may marry whomever she chooses; he seems to concede. Margaret is at first dismissive of court [[lothario]] Brandon, but they soon have passionate sex on the long sea voyage to Portugal. Margaret marries the decrepit Portuguese king, who lives only a few days until she smothers him in his sleep. Henry is angry to lose the political alliance, but even more furious when he discovers that Margaret and Brandon have married without his consent. With accusations of treason, they are exiled from court; the Duke of Norfolk soon promises to intervene on Brandon's behalf in exchange for Brandon's assistance in ruining Norfolk's political rival, Cardinal Wolsey. Margaret's relationship with Brandon eventually collapses; she argues that he only \"loved her for an hour\", as he continues to have affairs with other women. As Brandon returns to favor at court, Margaret displays an obvious dislike for Anne Boleyn and her allies. Margaret falls ill with pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], and dies as Charles is engaging in sex with another woman. Henry is furious at Brandon for his lack of attention to his wife, and Brandon shows remorse as he buries Margaret. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Ambassador Mendoza}} '''Ambassador Mendoza'''\n| align=\"center\"| Declan Conlon (2007\u20132009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[\u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.02\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The Spanish ambassador to England, Mendoza serves as a link between Queen Katherine and her nephew, Charles V, as her letters are being opened by Cardinal Wolsey. He is also the one friend Katherine has at court, since her Spanish ladies-in-waiting were dismissed by Wolsey, and her English ladies-in-waiting were either bribed or seduced by the Cardinal, to say nothing of being seduced by the king himself. He bore the brunt of Henry VIII's anger and when Charles V broke the treaty between England and Spain by setting free Francis I of France without consulting Henry, as Charles's ally, and also marrying Isabella of Portugal when he is betrothed to Princess Mary. He is promoted by Charles and sent home to Spain, leaving the issue of Queen Katherine and King Henry's divorce to be handled by Eustace Chapuys (the Imperial Ambassador, who remained to represent all of Charles V's territory). \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Eustace Chapuys}} '''Eustace Chapuys'''\n| align=\"center\"| Anthony Brophy (2007\u20132010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Eustace Chapuys]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 4.08\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's ambassador to the court of Henry VIII, initially serving alongside Mendoza (the Spanish Ambassador), but later representing all of Charles V's territory on his own. As the Emperor is the nephew to Katherine of Aragon, his ambassador acts as her ally and plots against Anne Boleyn but achieves little. Chapuys attempts to use the devoutly Catholic courtier William Brereton to assassinate Anne but the conspiracy fails. Brereton is subsequently executed for (falsely) admitting that he had an affair with Queen Anne. While presented as a skilled and cunning diplomat and courtier, Chapuys appears genuinely devoted to Lady Mary, advising and reassuring her during the period that she is out of favour with the King. Towards the end of the series, Chapuys, now elderly and suffering from bad [[gout]], resigns his post and returns to Spain. Although furious with Chapuys and the Emperor for their recent treaty with France, Henry appears somewhat put out that he is to leave and wishes him a happy retirement. Before he leaves, Chapuys gives Mary a ring that had been given to him by the Emperor, which he in turn had received from Katherine of Aragon. Mary vows to restore England to Catholicism no matter the cost; Chapuys is visibly shaken by Mary's fanaticism. Shortly after his return to Spain, Chapuys dies, news that devastates Mary.\n\nChapuys has the distinction of being the only character to feature prominently in all four seasons without ever being a starring cast member. His origin and ultimate fate were changed for the series: historically, he was a [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoyard]] (not a Spaniard as suggested in the series) and retired to the Low Countries, where he set up a small college in 1548. He died in 1556, meaning that he in fact lived into Mary's reign. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Emperor Charles}} '''Emperor Charles'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Sebastian Armesto]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Alternately the ally and adversary of King Henry VIII, Charles begins the series as the King of Spain and is the nephew of Henry's first wife, Queen Katherine of Aragon. He swiftly becomes [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as well, making him the single most powerful man in Christendom, and thus the perfect ally for Henry to lay aside his alliance with France for. He was betrothed to Princess Mary, although he later broke the betrothal in order to marry Isabella of Portugal. Charles only appears in a single episode of the first season, but is mentioned in almost every episode of the series thereafter, usually referred to simply as \"the Emperor.\" He is initially represented in England by Ambassadors Mendoza (of Spain) and Chapuys (of the Holy Roman Empire), although he eventually recalls Mendoza and authorizes Chapuys to represent him alone. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|George Boleyn}} '''George Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[P\u00e1draic Delaney]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.04\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.09\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Son of Thomas Boleyn and brother to Mary and Anne Boleyn.

Lady Salisbury later earns the King's enmity as the mother of Reginald Pole, who declines his offer of an appointment to a senior position in the Church of England but reluctantly accepts the rank of cardinal from the Pope. With Cardinal Pole beyond his reach Henry takes vengeance against his family by having Lady Salisbury, another of her sons and her young grandson executed. Historically, this was widely seen as an atrocious act by Henry against an elderly woman who was innocent of any crime.   \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Bishop John Fisher}} '''Bishop John Fisher'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Bosco Hogan]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Bishop John Fisher]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.05\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Bishop of Rochester and legal [[counsel]] to Katherine of Aragon.

When Catherine learns that Brandon has had a brief affair with the French ambassador's mistress she forgives him, saying that he was the only one who made her cry. In Season 3 their marriage suffers from her contempt for Brandon's willingness to enforce the King's orders in ruthlessly putting down Catholic unrest in northern England.  In season 4, she is not present and is estranged from her husband. She is not referred to in the series as \u2018Catherine Willoughby\u2019 (which would have been historically accurate, as she was the daughter of Lord Willoughby and Katherine of Aragon's lady in waiting Maria de Salinas); Brandon says her name is \u2018Catherine Brook\u2019.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|William Brereton}} '''William Brereton'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[James Gilbert (actor)|James Gilbert]] (2008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.09\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Seeming to be commissioned by Pope Paul III and Ambassador Chapuys to assassinate Anne Boleyn for the good of King Henry VIII and the Catholic Church.

She has an arranged marriage (through her and George's families), is sexually abused by George, who shows no affection for her at all. She tries to win his love but is frustrated by his affairs and disgusted when she learns of his relationship with Mark Smeaton. She avoids sharing in the fall of the Boleyns by giving evidence against her husband and agreeing to the allegation that he committed incest with his sister.\n\nDespite her unhappy marriage and the scandal of her in-laws, Jane is asked back to court by Queen Jane and is appointed her principal lady in waiting. Jane secretly helps the Queen to get funds to the Lady Elizabeth's governess when Henry refuses to pay and arranges the public return of Lady Mary to court. Lady Rochford is a keen supporter of the Reformation and abhors the Catholic faith, although she is so moved by Jane's actions that she puts aside her opinions. She is later seen as a lady-in-waiting to Catherine Howard, whom she despises, and manipulates her into a clandestine affair with Thomas Culpepper, one of Henry's grooms who is pathologically obsessed with the young queen. Once the affair came to light, she was interrogated and arrested for treason (as well as aiding and abetting) and had a nervous breakdown. Despite Lady Rochford being declared legally insane, King Henry VIII passed a law to make it legal to execute her by beheading. She was executed the same day as Catherine Howard. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Princess Elizabeth Tudor}} '''Princess Elizabeth Tudor'''\n| align=\"center\"| Kate Duggan (2008) <br />Claire MacCauley (2009) <br />Laoise Murray (2010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Elizabeth I of England]] \n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07 (Duggan) <br /> Episode 3.03 (MacCauley) <br /> Episode 4.01 (Murray)\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10 (Duggan) <br /> Episode 3.07 (MacCauley) <br /> Episode 4.10 (Murray)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn.

Shortly before Anne's execution, her marriage to Henry is annulled, making Elizabeth a bastard. She is removed from the line of succession and referred to as Lady Elizabeth.\n\nIn the aftermath of Anne's execution, Henry is initially unwilling to have anything to do with Elizabeth, claiming not to believe that she is his child, but when Elizabeth's half-sister, Mary, and stepmother, Jane Seymour, arrange for her to be brought to court and presented to her father for Christmas 1536, she is welcomed. She attends the christening of her half-brother, Edward, and later goes to live at Hundson with Mary. In episode 3.07, Elizabeth and Mary are present at court to greet their newest stepmother, Anne of Cleves. During Henry's marriage to Katherine Howard, Elizabeth is much warmer to her than Mary, but makes no secret of her preference for Anne of Cleves, and spends most of her free time at Hever Castle (Anne's residence and Elizabeth's ancestral home). In episode 4.06, Elizabeth treats her restoration to the succession with dread, and declares to Mary, with God as her witness, that she will never marry.\n\nElizabeth develops a closeness to her sister and brother. She is seen to be good friends with Anne of Cleves and, in the fourth season, grows close to Catherine Parr, who vows to raise Elizabeth in the faith of her mother. However, throughout all of this, she and her father remain somewhat distant. By the end Henry acknowledges, while conversing with the spirit of Anne Boleyn, that he has always been proud of his daughter and does recognise that she is very intelligent. He also reveals that he wishes that he could have shown her more affection but that her resemblance to her mother (Elizabeth looked like her father, but had her mother's eyes and personality) made him keep her at arm's length.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Lady Ursula Misseldon}} '''Lady Ursula Misseldon'''\n| align=\"center\"| Charlotte Salt (2009)\n| align=\"center\"| Mary Shelton or Margaret Skipwith<ref>http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/margaret-skipwith-ormsby-mistress-henry-viii-elizabeth-norton/#more-25977</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | A lady in waiting to Queen Jane though not a historical figure.

Weighing most on his mind is his failure thus far to produce a male heir with his Queen, Katherine of Aragon, a pious and dutiful Queen who is popular with the people. He does, however, dote on his daughter Mary, whom he hopes to marry off to a European ruler. The difficult pursuit of a [[divorce]] approved by the [[Pope]] begins when Henry meets, falls in love with, and later seduces Anne Boleyn. Determined that Anne will be his wife and will provide him with a legitimate son, Henry separates himself from his wife and the Catholic faith causing friction with the pope and a clash of religious opinions. The series portrays Henry as having a major turning point in his marriage to Katherine after a near-death experience in the early 1520s, after which he becomes obsessed with trying to produce a male heir.\n\nWhen he fails in his attempts to have a son with her, he is quick to lay the blame at Anne's door and then by chance meets Jane Seymour, a sweet, shy girl, and falls in love with her. Convinced that his future lies with Jane, Henry takes the chance to be rid of Anne when his longtime friend Charles Brandon tells him of rumors suggesting that she has been unfaithful. Anne is quickly brought to trial, found guilty and executed.\n\nAlthough Henry's personal life improves with his marriage to Jane Seymour, who helps reunite him with his daughters, his position is threatened when Catholics in the north start to rebel against him. He crushes the rebellion and brutally punishes those involved. Finally Henry's wish comes true when Jane gives him the one thing that his last two wives could not: a son. But Jane falls sick and dies from childbed fever a few days later, leaving Henry in a deep state of depression.\n\nHe remains a widower for three years until Thomas Cromwell pushes him into a fourth marriage with the German Anne of Cleves. He agrees to wed her but is disgusted by her when he finally meets her. Unable to escape the betrothal, he marries Anne but starts divorce proceedings soon after. He then notices the extremely young Catherine Howard and decides to marry her because she makes him feel young again. Catherine Howard is executed once her hidden past relations with Francis Dereham and her adulterous affair with Thomas Culpeper came to light. Henry later marries his sixth and final wife, Catherine Parr, a wealthy widow closer to Henry's age. She is a loving wife and stepmother to all three of Henry's children and is made Queen Regent during Henry's absence at [[Boulogne]]. Bishop Gardiner and others suspect Catherine Parr of heresy and nearly have her arrested for it, but she is able to convince Henry of her devotion to him.\n\nIn 1536, while participating in a joust, Henry suffered a grievous leg wound that never healed properly and gave him pain the rest of his life. It also prevented him from being as active as he had been, and he became morbidly obese in the last years of his life. His increasing pain and approaching infirmity makes it doubtful the King can participate in the invasion of France in alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor. However, he rouses himself and leads the successful siege of Boulogne in 1544. In the fall of that year, he returns to England, where his health declines until his death in January 1547.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Cardinal Wolsey}} '''Cardinal Wolsey'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Sam Neill]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Wolsey]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Cardinal Thomas Wolsey of York is King Henry VIII's primary and most trusted adviser, but the Cardinal's personal power (and influence over the King) has aroused the ire of several noblemen in Henry's court, and even of Queen Katherine herself. He desperately tries to find a way for Henry to free himself of his marriage, but fails and his enemies pounce. He is subsequently arrested for treason against the King and commits suicide by slashing his neck during prayer.(historically he died of natural causes whilst en route from York to London to face trial).

Brandon's infidelity makes the marriage an unhappy one. He becomes an ally of the Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Boleyn, to bring about the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey and to ensure his own return to court. After the removal of Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor, Brandon is appointed to the presidency of the Privy Council by Henry. After his promotion he shows little interest in the work of government leaving this responsibility to the Duke of Norfolk with whom he jointly shares the duties as president. Brandon is seen as a playboy in the show's first season, but as Duke of Suffolk becomes a mature courtier and magnate after marrying Catherine Willoughby in the second season. He hates the new queen and eventually quarrels with the Boleyn family, mainly directing his rage at his onetime ally, Thomas Boleyn. In the third season, Brandon is a reluctant but efficient leader of the King's forces, sent to ruthlessly repress a Catholic uprising. He is jealous of Thomas Cromwell, working to ensure his fall from office. In the third and fourth seasons, Brandon senses the increasing disdain that his second wife feels for his flawed character. In the final season he falls in love with Brigitte Rousselot, a young French woman he captured during the [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u201346)|siege of Boulogne]] and takes her back to England.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Duke of Norfolk}} '''Duke of Norfolk'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Henry Czerny]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Uncle of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII's fifth wife, Catherine Howard. Norfolk is represented as an arrogant intriguer, conscious of his noble rank and arch-enemy of Cardinal Wolsey. He and his brother-in-law Thomas Boleyn conspire to maneuver his niece, Anne Boleyn, into Henry's bed in order to gain influence over him and to advance their own interests. Together with Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, they engineer Wolsey's overthrow and then his arrest (and indirectly, his subsequent death). Norfolk is subsequently jointly appointed with Suffolk to the presidency of the Privy Council. Norfolk does not appear in seasons 2, 3 or 4, although, in actual history, he was still alive and played a significant role in the events which transpired in those series; [[Catherine Howard]] was a closer relation to him than portrayed in season 3. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Anne Boleyn}} '''Anne Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Natalie Dormer]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Anne Boleyn]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10{{br}}(4.10 Dream Sequence)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Daughter of Thomas Boleyn, and sister of George and Mary Boleyn. Anne was sent to be a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine, as a pawn of her father's and her uncle's schemes to ruin Cardinal Wolsey. She attracted Henry VIII's attention at the masquerade where she, along with Henry's sister Margaret, played two of the Graces. By her father's orders, she continually put herself in Henry's way, till Henry was so enamoured of her that he vowed he would take her as his only mistress if she would give herself to him. Anne, remembering how her sister was thrown aside after Henry tired of her, refused him, saying that she was saving her virginity for her eventual husband, causing Henry, already at odds with Queen Katherine for failing to produce a living son, to consider annulment or divorce. She admits to her father that while she did not like the role of sacrificial lamb at first, she was growing to love Henry. At first the relationship was a secret, but more and more Henry honored her as his consort rather than Katherine. The delay of the annulment proceedings frustrated Henry, and Anne used this opportunity to blame Wolsey for the delay, leaving him when she felt that the proceedings will never come to fruition. She also gradually turned him in favor of Protestantism so that, as head of the church in his realm, he could finally divorce Katherine without referring to the Roman Church.\n\nThe second season sees Anne reach the peak of her power. She is created as Marquess of Pembroke and is taken to France to meet the French King, Francis, as the future Queen and sleeps with Henry and thus conceives a child who she is confident will be a boy.  Soon afterwards, Henry marries Anne and crowns her as Queen, his marriage to Catherine annulled by Cranmer; however, Anne and Henry's hopes are dashed when she gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, which sets in motion the Act of Succession. She is more or less manipulated by her father to do everything to win Henry's love (which becomes evident after her miscarriage of her second child). She allows Henry to disinherit his daughter Mary but tries to establish ties with her on the condition that Mary accept her as queen \u2013 Mary rebuffs this offer.\n\nAnne becomes desperate to conceive a son, but miscarries twice after Elizabeth and is eventually accused of witchcraft and adultery.  Henry removes Elizabeth from the line of succession, convinced she is not his daughter, and sentences Anne to execution by beheading, which she goes to with dignity and surprising admiration from the people.  Anne re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Elizabeth, expressing pride for her daughter, proclaiming her innocence that the crimes she was killed for, and showing sympathy for her deceased cousin Catherine Howard.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Katherine of Aragon}} '''Katherine of Aragon'''<ref name=\"Spelling\">As established by the series credits and [http://www.sho.com/site/tudors/characters.do character list on the official website] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628235856/http://www.sho.com/site/tudors/characters.do |date=2009-06-28 }}, the character's name is spelled Katherine with a \"K\" in contrast to the [[English language]] spelling \"Catherine\" usually used for the actual historical figure.</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07{{br}}(4.10 Dream Sequence)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Youngest child of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, Katherine is the first wife and [[queen consort]] of Henry VIII. She was once married to Henry's older brother, Arthur, but claims that that marriage was never consummated. Most of her children with Henry VIII were either miscarried or died in infancy; her one surviving child was her daughter, Princess Mary.\n\nBecause of her seeming inability to give him a son, along with the onset of [[menopause]], Henry worries that England might face a reversion to civil war in the event of his death. With the [[Wars of the Roses]] still a recent memory, he was determined to have a legitimate son to whom to pass his throne. He therefore preferred to believe that Katherine lied when she swore that her previous marriage was never consummated and that therefore his marriage to her was [[incest]]uous and illegal. Katherine was very lonely at court, her only friend was the ambassador of Spain, as Cardinal Wolsey dismissed her Spanish ladies-in-waiting for fear that they were spies for the Holy Roman Emperor. Nevertheless, she always does her duty as Queen of England admirably, even mingling with and donating to the common people after church services, and she is loved by the English people despite her Spanish background. She is banished to spend her final days at the house \"The More\", without any contact from the king's staff or her daughter Mary. She is last seen dictating her will on her deathbed, read both aloud and, intercutting with, by a mournful Henry VIII; Anne smiles upon hearing the news and states that \"Now, I am indeed queen.\" Katherine re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Mary, confronting Henry about his treatment of her daughter and her own status as his 'true wife'. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Boleyn}} '''Thomas Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Nick Dunning]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Father of George, Mary, and Anne Boleyn, and brother-in-law to the Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn appears initially as the English ambassador to France, who sees his daughters primarily as a means to advance family interests. To this end, he encourages Mary to become Henry's mistress and, subsequently, Anne to aim for the higher status of a royal marriage. Together with Norfolk and Suffolk, Boleyn engineers Cardinal Wolsey's downfall. He then becomes a leading member of the Royal Council, although somewhat subordinate to his two fellow plotters in jointly handling the country's affairs. In the second season, Boleyn starts to worry that Anne is losing the king's love and urges her to keep him at her side, even telling her to 'offer him a gift', one of her ladies-in-waiting as a mistress. He is later faced with Anne's fear of the Seymour family but this only catches his attention when his ally, Thomas Cromwell, offers his quarters to them at the King's request. Following Cromwell's investigation of rumors of treason committed by Anne, Boleyn is arrested along with others, but is reprieved by the King and exiled from court. He is berated by Charles Brandon in the last episode of Season 2 for his selfishness and his evident relief that he will live while his son and daughter will die. In the Season 4 episode \"''A Moment of Nostalgia''\" Brandon mentions that Boleyn has died recently with only the ghosts of his children in attendance at the funeral.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas More}} '''Thomas More'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Jeremy Northam]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas More]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Longtime friend of Henry VIII, Sir Thomas is a pious Christian who abhors war and tried to advise Henry against it. He nevertheless believes that stern action is required to combat the rise of Lutheranism. During his time as Lord Chancellor after Wolsey, More burns to death six people found guilty of heresy, although he offers them the chance to recant. After it becomes apparent that the king was also changing his attitude towards Catholicism, he becomes worried, finally recalling that Wolsey once told him that he should have told the king what he ought to do, not what he can do, for \"if the lion knows his own strength, no man could control him\". More is married with four children. In the second season More avoids taking any public position over the king's \"great matter\" of divorce from Catherine, but is finally condemned and executed after refusing to take an oath recognizing Henry as supreme head of the English Church.  He is condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered but Henry, out of respect, reduces the execution to a quick beheading. Henry shows deep regret over More's death. \n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Cromwell}} '''Thomas Cromwell'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[James Frain]] (2007\u20132009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.04<!-- NOTE: Not main cast credited until episode #1.04 -->\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.08\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Although Thomas Cromwell was elevated by Cardinal Wolsey after the king's secretary was removed (see Richard Pace, below), he was secretly the ally of the Boleyn family. He is also represented as the man who introduces Anne Boleyn to [[Lutheranism]], which she subsequently introduced to Henry VIII. In the second season, Cromwell rises to the position of chief minister after the fall of Thomas More. Although More is later beheaded for refusing to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church in England, Cromwell takes a sympathetic approach towards him, as he deeply admires More; he also orders swift and necessary action when allegations arise regarding Queen Anne Boleyn (which leads to her ultimate downfall).  A characteristic of Cromwell is that, although he is untrustworthy to anyone but the King and is no-one's true friend, he always gives potential opponents a fair warning and a neutral, unbiased viewpoint; while guarded about his own opinions, he is not hesitant to show genuine admiration when he feels it. In this, he is very like Thomas More (though Cromwell is a Protestant reformer and More was a devout Catholic) but is much more unscrupulous with his actions.\n\nCromwell is depicted as being ruthless and calculating, but also as a hard-working and extremely able minister; he is Wolsey's true successor as the King's right hand. His historic role as a talented administrator and reformer eventually comes into conflict with Henry's ambiguous commitment to the Reformation; the series portrays Cromwell as a committed Protestant who sees the Reformation slipping away, with the Church of England, despite its break from Rome, retaining Catholic tradition and ritual. An attempt to strengthen the King's ties to Protestantism through a German marriage to Anne of Cleves (though couched as a political alliance) backfires. Because of his commoner origins Cromwell is resented by nobles such as the Duke of Suffolk and frequently abused even by Henry. His beheading is a botched affair because the executioner is drunk.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Wyatt}} '''Thomas Wyatt'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Jamie King (actor)|Jamie King]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03<!-- NOTE: Not main cast credited until episode #2.01 -->\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The former love of Anne Boleyn, poet Thomas Wyatt befriends and collaborates with composer Thomas Tallis while both are on a trip to [[France]] with Cardinal Wolsey. He claims to have had carnal relations with Anne, although this is at odds with Anne saying that her maidenhead was only for her husband to claim. He makes few appearances in the first season, but appears frequently in the second. He still holds and proclaims his feelings for Anne even though she has married the King. Wyatt is arrested and charged with betraying Henry, but is released in time to see Anne's execution. He notes the irony that of the accused lovers, he is the only one who is actually guilty and the only one who survived.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Thomas Cranmer}} '''Thomas Cranmer'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Hans Matheson]] (2008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Thomas Cranmer]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was involved in handing the dispute over Henry's marriage of Katherine of Aragon as being \"null and void\" and recognize Anne Boleyn as the new queen, having everybody swear an oath to recognize their new queen. He was introduced as a nervous man when Thomas Cromwell introduced him to the king. When he became the new Archbishop, he gained more confidence and took decisions to move against Katherine and reform the Church in England. He was portrayed from then on as cold and harsh but devoted. A determined Protestant reformer, he resented traditionalist men like Thomas More and Bishop Fisher and, despite their years of loyal service to the king, he branded them as traitors.\n\nHe is deeply loyal and devoted to Anne Boleyn but, despite his devotion to her, he is forced to relinquish the mutual desire for a reformed faith when Anne falls from favour. He takes her last confession in the Tower and breaks the news to her that Elizabeth is to be declared illegitimate but promises her that he will endeavour to keep her in the King's \"good and kind graces\". Historically Cranmer lived until Henry\u2019s daughter Mary inherited the throne, when she, a staunch catholic, had him executed for his Protestant beliefs.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Paul III}} '''Pope Paul III'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Peter O'Toole]] (2008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Pope Paul III]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church who declares Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn invalid and with ex-communicates Henry. Portrayed as a skilled politician with a dry sense of humour, Pope Paul sends a \"Soldier in Christ\" to assassinate the new queen, with the promise that he will gain access into heaven no matter if it succeeds or fails. Paul is outraged by and denounces the executions of both Bishop Fisher and Thomas More. He has no qualms about using force when necessary but is also portrayed as a loving man who considers the Catholics his children and wants to protect them like a father would protect his child. This is shown, for example, when Paul signs a [[Sublimis Deus|document prohibiting the enslavement of the peoples of the New World]]. He remarks - rather pompously- that he must act as the conscience of the Kings of Europe. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Jane Seymour}} '''Jane Seymour'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Anita Briem]] (2008){{br}}[[Annabelle Wallis]] (2009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Jane Seymour]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07 (Briem){{br}}Episode 3.01 (Wallis)\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10 (Briem){{br}}Episode 3.04 (Wallis){{br}}(4.10 Dream Sequence)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Becoming less interested in his new wife Anne Boleyn with her failure to produce a male heir, King Henry VIII has Jane Seymour made one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting in an attempt to seduce her. Jane, mindful of her reputation and following her brother's advice, refuses Henry's gifts and advances, impressing the king with her modesty. A romance develops between Henry and Jane as his marriage to Anne further deteriorates; when Anne catches Henry kissing Jane, she flies into a rage and miscarries a son. Henry orchestrates Anne's arrest for adultery, moving Jane into her quarters and unofficially proposing marriage. Henry and Jane become engaged on the same day as Anne's execution and get married just 10 days later. As an increasingly popular Queen, Jane promotes Mary's interests and secures her position back at court. She also appeals to Henry to restore the monasteries on behalf of the Catholics but she is quickly rebuked by him for meddling in his affairs. Unlike the doomed Anne, she heeds his warning and pursues her agendas within the restrictions of her gender and position. Jane reunites Henry with both his daughters over Christmastide to everybody's delight. Her position as Queen is cemented when she gives birth to Henry's son, Edward. However the birth is long and difficult and she dies twelve days after from childbed fever, leaving Henry devastated as he falls into a deep depression from his grief. Henry regards Jane as his true love because of her kind nature and the fact that she gave him a son. She is given a Queen's burial and Henry promises that one day they will be with each other again when he is buried beside her. Jane re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Edward, furious that Edward has been treated badly and will die at a very young age, frightening Henry.

Bryan takes an instant attraction to the fictional character Lady Ursula Misseldon and quickly becomes her lover. Although initially ready to act as an agent for Thomas Cromwell in attempting to intimidate Princess Mary, Bryan turns against the disgraced Minister and by getting his executioner drunk is able to ensure that Cromwell's death is a cruel one.

Mary's place in succession was lost when her parents' marriage was annulled, and so Mary was referred to as \"Lady Mary\", and any and all contact with her mother was forbidden (much to her pain; as she was not present when she died of illness). Ultimately, her father severed all ties with her when her half-sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] was born, and so Mary was formally expelled from court, her servants dismissed from her service, and she was forced to serve as a [[lady-in-waiting]], while Elizabeth received Mary's place in the succession. Mary is relieved not only when her future stepmother, Jane Seymour, made efforts to befriend with her and revealed her hopes to restore her to the succession, but also to hear of Anne Boleyn's execution. Mary was allowed back to court when she (very reluctantly) signed a document that formally declared her allegiance to her father and acknowledgement as him being the Head of the Church; relinquishing her own Catholic faith in the process (something she agonized over). Henry had threatened to put her to death if she had refused, but upon seeing Mary for the first time in years, immediately regretted all his actions and welcomed her back. Mary was initially furious over the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Anne of Cleves becoming the new queen, but warmed to her considerably upon meeting Catherine Howard, her frivolous, immature replacement. Following Catherine's execution, Mary renewed her friendship with Catherine Parr, the Lady Latimer (historically, Parr was Katherine of Aragon's goddaughter, though this was not mentioned in the series), and was initially pleased at her father's interest and subsequent marriage to her. Mary's attitude hardened upon realizing that Parr was Protestant, however. This discovery, which coincides with the departure of her friend and father-figure Eustace Chapuys, the Imperial Ambassador, causes Mary to finally snap and reveal the true depths of her fanaticism.\n\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Edward Seymour}} '''Edward Seymour'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Max Brown (actor)|Max Brown]] (2008\u20132010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.08\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 4.10\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Brother of Jane Seymour, he is quickly elevated as Jane gained the King's favour.

Their marriage is a happy one and Catherine even serves as regent for Henry during his Boulogne campaign. Catherine is a Protestant reformer and is later suspected of heresy by Bishop Gardiner. However, after an appeal to Henry's ego, she manages to escape the charges being brought against her. Catherine is shown to be close to all three of the King's children.

After being reprimanded by Henry for attempting to humiliate Wolsey, Buckingham recklessly plans to assassinate the King. However, this plan is reported to the Cardinal by Thomas Boleyn, whom Buckingham had tried to recruit. Buckingham is subsequently convicted of treason and beheaded.

In Episode 1.04, Compton is knighted Sir William Compton, alongside Knivert, for no more apparent reason than having amused the King by substituting a small log for a lance while jousting. The new Sir William is portrayed throughout the series as a witty and elegant courtier who avoids the occasional blunders of his two friends Brandon and Knivert. Compton, though married, soon shows a romantic homosexual interest in the young composer [[Thomas Tallis (The Tudors)|Thomas Tallis]] in Episode 1.05. At first Tallis refuses Compton's advances, but does not pull away when Compton kisses him; later they are shown in bed together.

He refuses, and she is further irritated that he has chosen his common-born friend Charles Brandon to accompany her to Portugal and present her to her future husband.  Margaret pressures Henry to agree that, once her husband is dead, she may marry whomever she chooses; he seems to concede. Margaret is at first dismissive of court [[lothario]] Brandon, but they soon have passionate sex on the long sea voyage to Portugal. Margaret marries the decrepit Portuguese king, who lives only a few days until she smothers him in his sleep. Henry is angry to lose the political alliance, but even more furious when he discovers that Margaret and Brandon have married without his consent. With accusations of treason, they are exiled from court; the Duke of Norfolk soon promises to intervene on Brandon's behalf in exchange for Brandon's assistance in ruining Norfolk's political rival, Cardinal Wolsey. Margaret's relationship with Brandon eventually collapses; she argues that he only \"loved her for an hour\", as he continues to have affairs with other women. As Brandon returns to favor at court, Margaret displays an obvious dislike for Anne Boleyn and her allies. Margaret falls ill with pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], and dies as Charles is engaging in sex with another woman. Henry is furious at Brandon for his lack of attention to his wife, and Brandon shows remorse as he buries Margaret. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Ambassador Mendoza}} '''Ambassador Mendoza'''\n| align=\"center\"| Declan Conlon (2007\u20132009)\n| align=\"center\"| [[\u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.02\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The Spanish ambassador to England, Mendoza serves as a link between Queen Katherine and her nephew, Charles V, as her letters are being opened by Cardinal Wolsey. He is also the one friend Katherine has at court, since her Spanish ladies-in-waiting were dismissed by Wolsey, and her English ladies-in-waiting were either bribed or seduced by the Cardinal, to say nothing of being seduced by the king himself. He bore the brunt of Henry VIII's anger and when Charles V broke the treaty between England and Spain by setting free Francis I of France without consulting Henry, as Charles's ally, and also marrying Isabella of Portugal when he is betrothed to Princess Mary. He is promoted by Charles and sent home to Spain, leaving the issue of Queen Katherine and King Henry's divorce to be handled by Eustace Chapuys (the Imperial Ambassador, who remained to represent all of Charles V's territory). \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Eustace Chapuys}} '''Eustace Chapuys'''\n| align=\"center\"| Anthony Brophy (2007\u20132010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Eustace Chapuys]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 4.08\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's ambassador to the court of Henry VIII, initially serving alongside Mendoza (the Spanish Ambassador), but later representing all of Charles V's territory on his own. As the Emperor is the nephew to Katherine of Aragon, his ambassador acts as her ally and plots against Anne Boleyn but achieves little. Chapuys attempts to use the devoutly Catholic courtier William Brereton to assassinate Anne but the conspiracy fails. Brereton is subsequently executed for (falsely) admitting that he had an affair with Queen Anne. While presented as a skilled and cunning diplomat and courtier, Chapuys appears genuinely devoted to Lady Mary, advising and reassuring her during the period that she is out of favour with the King. Towards the end of the series, Chapuys, now elderly and suffering from bad [[gout]], resigns his post and returns to Spain. Although furious with Chapuys and the Emperor for their recent treaty with France, Henry appears somewhat put out that he is to leave and wishes him a happy retirement. Before he leaves, Chapuys gives Mary a ring that had been given to him by the Emperor, which he in turn had received from Katherine of Aragon. Mary vows to restore England to Catholicism no matter the cost; Chapuys is visibly shaken by Mary's fanaticism. Shortly after his return to Spain, Chapuys dies, news that devastates Mary.\n\nChapuys has the distinction of being the only character to feature prominently in all four seasons without ever being a starring cast member. His origin and ultimate fate were changed for the series: historically, he was a [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoyard]] (not a Spaniard as suggested in the series) and retired to the Low Countries, where he set up a small college in 1548. He died in 1556, meaning that he in fact lived into Mary's reign. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |  \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Emperor Charles}} '''Emperor Charles'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Sebastian Armesto]] (2007)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.03\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Alternately the ally and adversary of King Henry VIII, Charles begins the series as the King of Spain and is the nephew of Henry's first wife, Queen Katherine of Aragon. He swiftly becomes [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as well, making him the single most powerful man in Christendom, and thus the perfect ally for Henry to lay aside his alliance with France for. He was betrothed to Princess Mary, although he later broke the betrothal in order to marry Isabella of Portugal. Charles only appears in a single episode of the first season, but is mentioned in almost every episode of the series thereafter, usually referred to simply as \"the Emperor.\" He is initially represented in England by Ambassadors Mendoza (of Spain) and Chapuys (of the Holy Roman Empire), although he eventually recalls Mendoza and authorizes Chapuys to represent him alone. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|George Boleyn}} '''George Boleyn'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[P\u00e1draic Delaney]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.04\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.09\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Son of Thomas Boleyn and brother to Mary and Anne Boleyn.

Lady Salisbury later earns the King's enmity as the mother of Reginald Pole, who declines his offer of an appointment to a senior position in the Church of England but reluctantly accepts the rank of cardinal from the Pope. With Cardinal Pole beyond his reach Henry takes vengeance against his family by having Lady Salisbury, another of her sons and her young grandson executed. Historically, this was widely seen as an atrocious act by Henry against an elderly woman who was innocent of any crime.   \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Bishop John Fisher}} '''Bishop John Fisher'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[Bosco Hogan]] (2007\u20132008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Bishop John Fisher]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 1.05\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Bishop of Rochester and legal [[counsel]] to Katherine of Aragon.

When Catherine learns that Brandon has had a brief affair with the French ambassador's mistress she forgives him, saying that he was the only one who made her cry. In Season 3 their marriage suffers from her contempt for Brandon's willingness to enforce the King's orders in ruthlessly putting down Catholic unrest in northern England.  In season 4, she is not present and is estranged from her husband. She is not referred to in the series as \u2018Catherine Willoughby\u2019 (which would have been historically accurate, as she was the daughter of Lord Willoughby and Katherine of Aragon\u2019s lady in waiting Maria de Salinas); Brandon says her name is \u2018Catherine Brook\u2019.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|William Brereton}} '''William Brereton'''\n| align=\"center\"| [[James Gilbert (actor)|James Gilbert]] (2008)\n| align=\"center\"| [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]]\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.09\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | Seeming to be commissioned by Pope Paul III and Ambassador Chapuys to assassinate Anne Boleyn for the good of King Henry VIII and the Catholic Church.

She has an arranged marriage (through her and George's families), is sexually abused by George, who shows no affection for her at all. She tries to win his love but is frustrated by his affairs and disgusted when she learns of his relationship with Mark Smeaton. She avoids sharing in the fall of the Boleyns by giving evidence against her husband and agreeing to the allegation that he committed incest with his sister.\n\nDespite her unhappy marriage and the scandal of her in-laws, Jane is asked back to court by Queen Jane and is appointed her principal lady in waiting. Jane secretly helps the Queen to get funds to the Lady Elizabeth's governess when Henry refuses to pay and arranges the public return of Lady Mary to court. Lady Rochford is a keen supporter of the Reformation and abhors the Catholic faith, although she is so moved by Jane's actions that she puts aside her opinions. She is later seen as a lady-in-waiting to Catherine Howard, whom she despises, and manipulates her into a clandestine affair with Thomas Culpepper, one of Henry's grooms who is pathologically obsessed with the young queen. Once the affair came to light, she was interrogated and arrested for treason (as well as aiding and abetting) and had a nervous breakdown. Despite Lady Rochford being declared legally insane, King Henry VIII passed a law to make it legal to execute her by beheading. She was executed the same day as Catherine Howard. \n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Princess Elizabeth Tudor}} '''Princess Elizabeth Tudor'''\n| align=\"center\"| Kate Duggan (2008) <br />Claire MacCauley (2009) <br />Laoise Murray (2010)\n| align=\"center\"| [[Elizabeth I of England]] \n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.07 (Duggan) <br /> Episode 3.03 (MacCauley) <br /> Episode 4.01 (Murray)\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 2.10 (Duggan) <br /> Episode 3.07 (MacCauley) <br /> Episode 4.10 (Murray)\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | The daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn.

Shortly before Anne's execution, her marriage to Henry is annulled, making Elizabeth a bastard. She is removed from the line of succession and referred to as Lady Elizabeth.\n\nIn the aftermath of Anne's execution, Henry is initially unwilling to have anything to do with Elizabeth, claiming not to believe that she is his child, but when Elizabeth's half-sister, Mary, and stepmother, Jane Seymour, arrange for her to be brought to court and presented to her father for Christmas 1536, she is welcomed. She attends the christening of her half-brother, Edward, and later goes to live at Hundson with Mary. In episode 3.07, Elizabeth and Mary are present at court to greet their newest stepmother, Anne of Cleves. During Henry's marriage to Katherine Howard, Elizabeth is much warmer to her than Mary, but makes no secret of her preference for Anne of Cleves, and spends most of her free time at Hever Castle (Anne's residence and Elizabeth's ancestral home). In episode 4.06, Elizabeth treats her restoration to the succession with dread, and declares to Mary, with God as her witness, that she will never marry.\n\nElizabeth develops a closeness to her sister and brother. She is seen to be good friends with Anne of Cleves and, in the fourth season, grows close to Catherine Parr, who vows to raise Elizabeth in the faith of her mother. However, throughout all of this, she and her father remain somewhat distant. By the end Henry acknowledges, while conversing with the spirit of Anne Boleyn, that he has always been proud of his daughter and does recognise that she is very intelligent. He also reveals that he wishes that he could have shown her more affection but that her resemblance to her mother (Elizabeth looked like her father, but had her mother's eyes and personality) made him keep her at arm's length.\n|- style=\"background:#000000; height:2px\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| {{anchor|Lady Ursula Misseldon}} '''Lady Ursula Misseldon'''\n| align=\"center\"| Charlotte Salt (2009)\n| align=\"center\"| Mary Shelton or Margaret Skipwith<ref>http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/margaret-skipwith-ormsby-mistress-henry-viii-elizabeth-norton/#more-25977</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.01\n| align=\"center\"| Episode 3.05\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"5\" | A lady in waiting to Queen Jane though not a historical figure.

Life appears to go on as normal, but more and more of the populace are turned into vampires by Barlow and the new vampires he creates. Local writer Ben Mears, schoolteacher Matt Burke and a young boy named Mark Petrie discover what is happening. Joined by doctor Jimmy Cody and Susan Norton, they convince Callahan of the vampire presence and enlist him to help.\n\nCallahan leads a daytime assault on the old house that is Barlow's hiding place, only to find that the vampire has vacated the premises in anticipation of their attack. However, the group uses the opportunity to destroy the vampiric Susan, whom Barlow had turned during an unsuccessful attempt by her and Mark Petrie's to invade the house and destroy Barlow, and purify the house against future vampire occupation.\n\nThat night, Callahan encounters Barlow himself when the latter invades the Petrie family's home and kills Mark's parents in retaliation for Mark killing Barlow's trusted human familiar. Barlow then seizes Mark and challenges Callahan to drop the cross he is using to hold him at bay and face him \u201cfaith to faith\u201d. Callahan initially refuses, not trusting Barlow to release Mark, but Barlow ups the ante by releasing the boy, who flees. Now confronted with the choice, Callahan's faith fails, with the cross consequently becoming useless against Barlow. Barlow then seizes him, cuts open a vein in his own throat and forces the priest to drink his blood, damning him. Defeated, Callahan returns to his church, but burns his hand on the door and is refused entrance. Callahan leaves the town on a bus, bemoaning how \"unclean\" he has become.\n\n===''Wolves of the Calla''===\nAfter fleeing 'Salem's Lot, Callahan arrives in [[New York City]], and becomes a vagrant. Now able to sense vampires, he realizes that they live and hunt all around him.  His alcoholism gets worse but after he starts working at a homeless shelter, he begins to recover.  He befriends several people, such as Rowan Magruder and Lupe Delgado.  Callahan develops a deep fondness for Lupe, and later admits to having fallen in love with him. He wonders if this means he is [[gay]], but despite a brief kiss on the cheek, nothing physical occurs between them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=CRANMER|first1=DAVID|title=The Dark Tower: Wolves of the Calla Part III|url=https://www.criminalelement.com/blogs/2017/04/the-dark-tower-wolves-of-the-calla-part-iii|publisher=criminalelement.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCallahan learns that there are three types of vampires. The Type Ones are the most powerful and are almost [[Immortality|immortal]]. They can spread vampirism to others and create Type Two vampires. Kurt Barlow was a Type One. Type Twos are more common and can create other Type Twos or Type Threes. Lastly, the Type Threes cannot spread vampirism but can spread [[Blood-borne disease|diseases that travel by blood]], such as [[HIV]]. Callahan refers to them as \"mosquitoes\". After Lupe is infected by a Type Three vampire and dies from AIDS, Callahan begins to kill vampires (mostly Type Threes).  This attracts the attention of the [[Crimson King]] and his soldiers, the Low Men or \"[[can-toi]]\". The Hitler Brothers, two hoodlums who murder [[Jew]]s, black people and [[homosexual]]s and carve [[swastika]]s on their victim's foreheads, are hired to find Callahan. They torture Rowan Magruder, who later dies of his wounds, in hopes of finding him.\n\nThey later find and attack Callahan, and carve a [[cross]] on his forehead, intending it to become a swastika. But before they can finish the swastika, Callahan is rescued by Calvin Tower and Aaron Deepneau, two men who figure prominently later in Roland's quest. The Hitler Brothers flee, and are later killed by the Low Men. Callahan is later lured into a building by Richard Sayre, a Low Man, and several vampires. Rather than be infected, he jumps out a window committing [[suicide]].\n\nAfter his death, he wakes up in the Way Station, where he encounters [[Randall Flagg#The Dark Tower|Walter o'Dim]] who gives him [[Wizard's Rainbow#The Black Bend, AKA Black Thirteen|Black Thirteen]], one of the \"Bends\" in the [[Wizard's Rainbow]].  Walter apparently does so in the hopes that it will kill [[Roland Deschain]] later in his journey. It transports him to the Doorway Cave outside [[Calla Bryn Sturgis]], where he leads a new life and over the next five years attempts to teach the locals his religion.\n\nRoughly every twenty-three years, the Callas are raided by wolves, which turn out to be robotic soldiers serving the Crimson King. These Wolves steal half of the Calla's children, who return a few months later \"roont\".  \"Roont\" (ruined) children are sterile, mentally handicapped, grow to be larger and stronger than other children, and die painfully at a younger age. When Roland and his ka-tet arrive, Callahan seeks their help to defeat the Wolves. During their stay, he shares with them his story since the events of ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Salem's Lot''. The Wolves are defeated with the help of the ka-tet, but Susannah becomes possessed by the demon succubus known as Mia and escapes via the Doorway Cave. There, Callahan discovers a copy of the novel ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Salem's Lot'', in which he is a major character, causing him to question his reality.\n\n===''Song of Susannah''===\nImmediately after the events of the previous book, the ka-tet regroups in Callahan's house, where they lay down their plans of action; Roland and Eddie would follow Susannah to New York while Jake and Callahan would be sent to Maine, in order to visit Calvin Tower (the man who saved Callahan from the Hitler Brothers) as well as Stephen King, in order to ensure that the remaining books are written. While there, Callahan planned on questioning King about his existence, but something goes wrong when the door is opened.  The group is uncontrollably sucked through and separated, with Roland and Eddie ending up in Maine and Jake, Callahan, and Oy landing in New York City in the year 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Suzanne|title=A Read of the Dark Tower: Constant Reader Tackles Song of Susannah, 12th Stanza, \"Jake and Callahan,\" Sections 10-18|url=https://www.tor.com/2013/09/30/a-read-of-the-dark-tower-song-of-susannah-12th-stanza-jake-and-callahan-sections-10-18/|website=TOR|publisher=tor.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe trio lands violently in the middle of a busy street, and Oy is very nearly run down by a speeding cab. Preventing a potentially deadly response from an angry Jake, Callahan beats down the aggressive driver and bribes him (before Jake had the opportunity to shoot him), and they remove themselves from the scene.\n\nThanks to Jake's psychic connection with Susannah, they find the hotel where Susannah/Mia left Black Thirteen. They attempt to remove it safely, but it awakens and forces them both to their knees, urging them to murder each other. They nearly succumb to the suicidal whisperings, but Callahan uses his restored faith to silence the orb, putting it back into its slumber and saving their lives.\n\nIn search of a safe storage place, he and Jake move Black Thirteen to a long-term storage locker underneath the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], with the hope that either it will stay dormant or Roland will at some point come to destroy it. (Rather aptly, they comment on how [[September 11, 2001 attacks|a building falling on it might destroy it]], foreshadowing that the future terrorist attack will be the end of the crystal ball.)\n\nThey go to the Dixie Pig, the restaurant stronghold of the Low Men and vampires where Susannah is being held, where they prepare to ambush the unknown forces within.\n\n===''The Dark Tower''===\n[[File:Fathercallahandt7.jpg|thumb|right|Father Callahan from ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''.

After dispatching several Low Men and Type Ones, he is goaded to toss away both his cross and the sigul of the turtle (the magical ornament that incapacitates the Low Men). At this point Callahan realizes what he did not understand while facing Barlow in 'Salem's Lot: the power of his faith transcends such objects.\n\nEventually, once Jake has reached relative safety, Callahan is overwhelmed and swarmed by the vampires. Before the beasts can assault him, he once again escapes their clutches by shooting himself under the chin. Before taking his own life, he converses briefly with Roland, who bears witness to the scene across time and space. His final words to Roland and in life were a benediction to the Gunslinger: \"May you find your Tower, Roland, and breach it, ...and may you climb to the top!\"\n\nJake in particular was disturbed by his death, and the ka-tet mourned the loss of their friend and compatriot. When Roland finally made it to the Dark Tower, Callahan's is one of the names shouted by Roland as he walks through the field of roses, showing Roland's respect and love for the redeemed priest.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Deleted scene===\nThe original draft of ''{{'}}Salem's Lot'' originally depicted a different fate for Callahan. Rather than forced to drink Barlow's blood and leaving town damned, he marks the vampire with a knife before committing suicide. Furious, the vampire desecrates the priest's body, decapitating it and hanging it upside down. This scene was changed by King before he originally published the story, though it was included in a section of deleted scenes featured in the deluxe limited edition released by [[Centipede Press]] in 2005 and the later trade edition.\n\n===1979 miniseries===\nIn the [[Salem's Lot (1979 miniseries)|1979 miniseries adaptation of ''{{'}}Salem's Lot'']], Father Callahan is featured only as a minor character. He is played by James Gallery.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Callahan is first briefly seen officiating at the funeral of Danny Glick. Later, Ben Mears and Susan Norton have a brief interview with him where they try to convince him to join them against the evil in the town. Callahan is skeptical and makes a brief comment on how the Church's view of evil has changed. Soon afterwards, Callahan is at the Petrie house to talk to Mark and his parents about Mark's nocturnal experiences. Abruptly, with a surge of electricity and a tremor, the vampire Barlow enters, kills the Petrie parents, seizes Mark and challenges Callahan. The exchange, although shortened, is much the same as in the original novel, only with Straker, now also present, interpreting for the monstrous and inarticulate Barlow. Barlow lets Mark go in order to confront Callahan, who falteringly hold on to his crucifix while facing the vampire. Barlow plucks the Crucifix from the priest's hand, and Callahan is not seen again, presumably killed.\n\n===1995 radio drama===\nIn the [[Salem's Lot (radio drama)|BBC radio-dramatization]] of the ''{{'}}Salem's Lot'' novel, Callahan was voiced and played by [[Nigel Anthony]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio 3 Drama, 1995|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/r3-1995.html|publisher=suttonelms.org.uk|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2004 miniseries===\n[[File:Callahanreview.jpg|thumb|James Cromwell as Father Callahan.]]\n\nIn the 2004 [[Salem's Lot (2004 miniseries)|''Salem's Lot'' miniseries]], Father Callahan was portrayed by [[James Cromwell]]. The beginning of the film shows an event taking place after most of the story; Ben Mears enters a homeless shelter in a big city and sees Callahan giving out food. Mears confronts Callahan and chases him up some stairs where they struggle. Callahan shoots Mears, but Mears pushes himself and Callahan out a window and the two of them land on a police car. The rest of the film is told in flashback as Ben explains to a hospital orderly why he attacked Callahan.<ref>{{cite web|title='Salem's Lot 2004 Movie Review|url=http://perpetualpublishing.com/2011/08/22/salems-lot-movie-review/|publisher=perpetualpublishing.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCallahan is generally portrayed as in the novel (although there is a scene with him browsing what could be a Satanic porn site), but after Barlow forces him to drink his blood, Callahan does not leave town in shame.  Instead, he takes Straker's place as Barlow's [[servant|attendant]]. Callahan later visits Matt Burke in the hospital and murders him. After Ben Mears destroys Barlow, Callahan then leads the remaining vampires of Salem's Lot as his new unholy congregation while the town burns around them.\n\nAs Ben Mears tells his story to the orderly, Callahan is suffocated with a pillow by Mark Petrie in the hospital.\n\nThe framing story of Callahan now living in a big city, working in a homeless shelter and his being pushed out of an upper storey window are clearly inspired by the events in the ''Dark Tower: Wolves of the Calla'' novel, though the miniseries does not use any of the further material featuring Callahan from the other ''Dark Tower'' books, which feature his return and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://stephenking.com/DarkTower/ The Dark Tower official website]\n\n{{DarkTower}}\n{{'Salem's Lot}}\n{{Characters created by Stephen King}}\n\n<!-- not redundant, as he is not only a Dark Tower character -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Callahan, Father}}\n[[Category:Salem's Lot]]\n[[Category:The Dark Tower characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 21st century]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual males]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Maine]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n[[Category:Stephen King characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #66023C\n| name               = Father Callahan\n| series             = [[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]\n| image              = Callahanbook5.jpg\n| caption            = Father Callahan from ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]''.

He is at first an [[alcoholic]] with a troubled faith, but he seems to find his peace in ''The Dark Tower'' novels, and his faith is restored.<ref>{{cite web|title=FATHER DONALD CALLAHAN|url=https://www.shmoop.com/salems-lot/donald-callahan.html|publisher=shmoop.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===''{{'}}Salem's Lot''===\nFather Callahan is the local [[Roman Catholic]] priest of the small Maine town of [[Jerusalem's Lot (Stephen King)|Jerusalem's Lot]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=VAN RHEENEN|first1=ERIK|title=13 Things You May Not Know About The Dark Tower Series|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/62981/12-things-you-may-not-know-about-dark-tower-series|website=[[Mental Floss]]|publisher=mentalfloss.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=August 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Father Donald Callahan (Character) from Salem's Lot (1979) (TV)|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0019199/bio|website=[[IMDb]]|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref> An alcoholic, Callahan presides over the funeral of Danny Glick, a young boy who was, unbeknownst to the townsfolk, killed by the vampire [[Kurt Barlow]]. Life appears to go on as normal, but more and more of the populace are turned into vampires by Barlow and the new vampires he creates. Local writer Ben Mears, schoolteacher Matt Burke and a young boy named Mark Petrie discover what is happening. Joined by doctor Jimmy Cody and Susan Norton, they convince Callahan of the vampire presence and enlist him to help.\n\nCallahan leads a daytime assault on the old house that is Barlow\u2019s hiding place, only to find that the vampire has vacated the premises in anticipation of their attack. However, the group uses the opportunity to destroy the vampiric Susan, whom Barlow had turned during an unsuccessful attempt by her and Mark Petrie's to invade the house and destroy Barlow, and purify the house against future vampire occupation.\n\nThat night, Callahan encounters Barlow himself when the latter invades the Petrie family\u2019s home and kills Mark\u2019s parents in retaliation for Mark killing Barlow\u2019s trusted human familiar. Barlow then seizes Mark and challenges Callahan to drop the cross he is using to hold him at bay and face him \u201cfaith to faith\u201d. Callahan initially refuses, not trusting Barlow to release Mark, but Barlow ups the ante by releasing the boy, who flees. Now confronted with the choice, Callahan\u2019s faith fails, with the cross consequently becoming useless against Barlow. Barlow then seizes him, cuts open a vein in his own throat and forces the priest to drink his blood, damning him. Defeated, Callahan returns to his church, but burns his hand on the door and is refused entrance. Callahan leaves the town on a bus, bemoaning how \"unclean\" he has become.\n\n===''Wolves of the Calla''===\nAfter fleeing 'Salem's Lot, Callahan arrives in [[New York City]], and becomes a vagrant. Now able to sense vampires, he realizes that they live and hunt all around him.  His alcoholism gets worse but after he starts working at a homeless shelter, he begins to recover.  He befriends several people, such as Rowan Magruder and Lupe Delgado.  Callahan develops a deep fondness for Lupe, and later admits to having fallen in love with him. He wonders if this means he is [[gay]], but despite a brief kiss on the cheek, nothing physical occurs between them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=CRANMER|first1=DAVID|title=The Dark Tower: Wolves of the Calla Part III|url=https://www.criminalelement.com/blogs/2017/04/the-dark-tower-wolves-of-the-calla-part-iii|publisher=criminalelement.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCallahan learns that there are three types of vampires. The Type Ones are the most powerful and are almost [[Immortality|immortal]]. They can spread vampirism to others and create Type Two vampires. Kurt Barlow was a Type One. Type Twos are more common and can create other Type Twos or Type Threes. Lastly, the Type Threes cannot spread vampirism but can spread [[Blood-borne disease|diseases that travel by blood]], such as [[HIV]]. Callahan refers to them as \"mosquitoes\". After Lupe is infected by a Type Three vampire and dies from AIDS, Callahan begins to kill vampires (mostly Type Threes).  This attracts the attention of the [[Crimson King]] and his soldiers, the Low Men or \"[[can-toi]]\". The Hitler Brothers, two hoodlums who murder [[Jew]]s, black people and [[homosexual]]s and carve [[swastika]]s on their victim's foreheads, are hired to find Callahan. They torture Rowan Magruder, who later dies of his wounds, in hopes of finding him.\n\nThey later find and attack Callahan, and carve a [[cross]] on his forehead, intending it to become a swastika. But before they can finish the swastika, Callahan is rescued by Calvin Tower and Aaron Deepneau, two men who figure prominently later in Roland's quest. The Hitler Brothers flee, and are later killed by the Low Men. Callahan is later lured into a building by Richard Sayre, a Low Man, and several vampires. Rather than be infected, he jumps out a window committing [[suicide]].\n\nAfter his death, he wakes up in the Way Station, where he encounters [[Randall Flagg#The Dark Tower|Walter o'Dim]] who gives him [[Wizard's Rainbow#The Black Bend, AKA Black Thirteen|Black Thirteen]], one of the \"Bends\" in the [[Wizard's Rainbow]].  Walter apparently does so in the hopes that it will kill [[Roland Deschain]] later in his journey. It transports him to the Doorway Cave outside [[Calla Bryn Sturgis]], where he leads a new life and over the next five years attempts to teach the locals his religion.\n\nRoughly every twenty-three years, the Callas are raided by wolves, which turn out to be robotic soldiers serving the Crimson King. These Wolves steal half of the Calla's children, who return a few months later \"roont\".  \"Roont\" (ruined) children are sterile, mentally handicapped, grow to be larger and stronger than other children, and die painfully at a younger age. When Roland and his ka-tet arrive, Callahan seeks their help to defeat the Wolves. During their stay, he shares with them his story since the events of ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Salem's Lot''. The Wolves are defeated with the help of the ka-tet, but Susannah becomes possessed by the demon succubus known as Mia and escapes via the Doorway Cave. There, Callahan discovers a copy of the novel ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Salem's Lot'', in which he is a major character, causing him to question his reality.\n\n===''Song of Susannah''===\nImmediately after the events of the previous book, the ka-tet regroups in Callahan's house, where they lay down their plans of action; Roland and Eddie would follow Susannah to New York while Jake and Callahan would be sent to Maine, in order to visit Calvin Tower (the man who saved Callahan from the Hitler Brothers) as well as Stephen King, in order to ensure that the remaining books are written. While there, Callahan planned on questioning King about his existence, but something goes wrong when the door is opened.  The group is uncontrollably sucked through and separated, with Roland and Eddie ending up in Maine and Jake, Callahan, and Oy landing in New York City in the year 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Suzanne|title=A Read of the Dark Tower: Constant Reader Tackles Song of Susannah, 12th Stanza, \"Jake and Callahan,\" Sections 10-18|url=https://www.tor.com/2013/09/30/a-read-of-the-dark-tower-song-of-susannah-12th-stanza-jake-and-callahan-sections-10-18/|website=TOR|publisher=tor.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe trio lands violently in the middle of a busy street, and Oy is very nearly run down by a speeding cab. Preventing a potentially deadly response from an angry Jake, Callahan beats down the aggressive driver and bribes him (before Jake had the opportunity to shoot him), and they remove themselves from the scene.\n\nThanks to Jake's psychic connection with Susannah, they find the hotel where Susannah/Mia left Black Thirteen. They attempt to remove it safely, but it awakens and forces them both to their knees, urging them to murder each other. They nearly succumb to the suicidal whisperings, but Callahan uses his restored faith to silence the orb, putting it back into its slumber and saving their lives.\n\nIn search of a safe storage place, he and Jake move Black Thirteen to a long-term storage locker underneath the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], with the hope that either it will stay dormant or Roland will at some point come to destroy it. (Rather aptly, they comment on how [[September 11, 2001 attacks|a building falling on it might destroy it]], foreshadowing that the future terrorist attack will be the end of the crystal ball.)\n\nThey go to the Dixie Pig, the restaurant stronghold of the Low Men and vampires where Susannah is being held, where they prepare to ambush the unknown forces within.\n\n===''The Dark Tower''===\n[[File:Fathercallahandt7.jpg|thumb|right|Father Callahan from ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''. Art by [[Michael Whelan]].]]\nJake and Callahan burst into the Dixie Pig, where they are greeted by a preponderance of Low Men and lesser vampires, as well as a gathering of \"Type One\" vampires (of which there are only a small number in existence).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Suzanne|title=A Read of the Dark Tower: Constant Reader Tackles The Dark Tower, The Little Red King, Chapter 1|url=https://www.tor.com/2013/10/21/a-read-of-the-dark-tower-the-dark-tower-part-one-the-little-red-king-dan-tete-chapter-1-callahan-and-the-vampires/|website=TOR|publisher=tor.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSeeing the overwhelming odds against them, Callahan sends Jake on ahead to rescue Susannah while he draws their attention. After dispatching several Low Men and Type Ones, he is goaded to toss away both his cross and the sigul of the turtle (the magical ornament that incapacitates the Low Men). At this point Callahan realizes what he did not understand while facing Barlow in 'Salem's Lot: the power of his faith transcends such objects.\n\nEventually, once Jake has reached relative safety, Callahan is overwhelmed and swarmed by the vampires. Before the beasts can assault him, he once again escapes their clutches by shooting himself under the chin. Before taking his own life, he converses briefly with Roland, who bears witness to the scene across time and space. His final words to Roland and in life were a benediction to the Gunslinger: \"May you find your Tower, Roland, and breach it, ...and may you climb to the top!\"\n\nJake in particular was disturbed by his death, and the ka-tet mourned the loss of their friend and compatriot. When Roland finally made it to the Dark Tower, Callahan's is one of the names shouted by Roland as he walks through the field of roses, showing Roland's respect and love for the redeemed priest.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Deleted scene===\nThe original draft of ''{{'}}Salem's Lot'' originally depicted a different fate for Callahan. Rather than forced to drink Barlow's blood and leaving town damned, he marks the vampire with a knife before committing suicide. Furious, the vampire desecrates the priest's body, decapitating it and hanging it upside down. This scene was changed by King before he originally published the story, though it was included in a section of deleted scenes featured in the deluxe limited edition released by [[Centipede Press]] in 2005 and the later trade edition.\n\n===1979 miniseries===\nIn the [[Salem's Lot (1979 miniseries)|1979 miniseries adaptation of ''{{'}}Salem's Lot'']], Father Callahan is featured only as a minor character. He is played by James Gallery.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Callahan is first briefly seen officiating at the funeral of Danny Glick. Later, Ben Mears and Susan Norton have a brief interview with him where they try to convince him to join them against the evil in the town. Callahan is skeptical and makes a brief comment on how the Church's view of evil has changed. Soon afterwards, Callahan is at the Petrie house to talk to Mark and his parents about Mark's nocturnal experiences. Abruptly, with a surge of electricity and a tremor, the vampire Barlow enters, kills the Petrie parents, seizes Mark and challenges Callahan. The exchange, although shortened, is much the same as in the original novel, only with Straker, now also present, interpreting for the monstrous and inarticulate Barlow. Barlow lets Mark go in order to confront Callahan, who falteringly hold on to his crucifix while facing the vampire. Barlow plucks the Crucifix from the priest's hand, and Callahan is not seen again, presumably killed.\n\n===1995 radio drama===\nIn the [[Salem's Lot (radio drama)|BBC radio-dramatization]] of the ''{{'}}Salem's Lot'' novel, Callahan was voiced and played by [[Nigel Anthony]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio 3 Drama, 1995|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/r3-1995.html|publisher=suttonelms.org.uk|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2004 miniseries===\n[[File:Callahanreview.jpg|thumb|James Cromwell as Father Callahan.]]\n\nIn the 2004 [[Salem's Lot (2004 miniseries)|''Salem's Lot'' miniseries]], Father Callahan was portrayed by [[James Cromwell]]. The beginning of the film shows an event taking place after most of the story; Ben Mears enters a homeless shelter in a big city and sees Callahan giving out food. Mears confronts Callahan and chases him up some stairs where they struggle. Callahan shoots Mears, but Mears pushes himself and Callahan out a window and the two of them land on a police car. The rest of the film is told in flashback as Ben explains to a hospital orderly why he attacked Callahan.<ref>{{cite web|title='Salem's Lot 2004 Movie Review|url=http://perpetualpublishing.com/2011/08/22/salems-lot-movie-review/|publisher=perpetualpublishing.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCallahan is generally portrayed as in the novel (although there is a scene with him browsing what could be a Satanic porn site), but after Barlow forces him to drink his blood, Callahan does not leave town in shame.  Instead, he takes Straker's place as Barlow's [[servant|attendant]]. Callahan later visits Matt Burke in the hospital and murders him. After Ben Mears destroys Barlow, Callahan then leads the remaining vampires of Salem's Lot as his new unholy congregation while the town burns around them.\n\nAs Ben Mears tells his story to the orderly, Callahan is suffocated with a pillow by Mark Petrie in the hospital.\n\nThe framing story of Callahan now living in a big city, working in a homeless shelter and his being pushed out of an upper storey window are clearly inspired by the events in the ''Dark Tower: Wolves of the Calla'' novel, though the miniseries does not use any of the further material featuring Callahan from the other ''Dark Tower'' books, which feature his return and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://stephenking.com/DarkTower/ The Dark Tower official website]\n\n{{DarkTower}}\n{{'Salem's Lot}}\n{{Characters created by Stephen King}}\n\n<!-- not redundant, as he is not only a Dark Tower character -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Callahan, Father}}\n[[Category:Salem's Lot]]\n[[Category:The Dark Tower characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 21st century]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual males]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Maine]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n[[Category:Stephen King characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e''{{'}}Salem's Lot'':Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Callahan"}

The Nazis particularly targeted Jewish children, but also targeted ethnically [[Poles|Polish]] children and [[Romani people|Romani]] (also called Gypsy) children along with children with mental or physical defects (disabled children). The Nazis and their collaborators killed children both for these ideological reasons and in retaliation for real or alleged partisan attacks.<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST]</ref> Early killings were encouraged by the Nazis in [[action T4]], where children with disabilities were gassed using [[carbon monoxide]], starved to death, given [[phenol]] injections to the heart, or [[hanging|hanged]].\n[[{{Adolf Hitler|state=germany}}]]\n1,500,000 children, nearly all Jewish, were killed by the Nazis. A much smaller number were saved. Some simply survived, often in a [[ghetto]], occasionally in a [[concentration camp]]. Some were saved in various programs like the [[Kindertransport]] and the [[One Thousand Children]], in both of which children fled their homeland. Other children were saved by becoming [[Hidden Children]].

Some Jewish children began to form small strikes in their schools, leaving without permission during class when anti-Semitic elements were used. Others tried to conform with no success, and some parents just took their children out of school. Many mothers were horrified to find out that their children were being emotionally and physically attacked by their classmates and teachers for being Jewish. Mothers were more likely to take their children out of school than fathers, seeing and hearing from their children the majority of what actually happened at school.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEventually Jewish schools were built, and the Jewish community supported the idea of teaching their children without fear of persecution. Consequently, the number of children going to private school increased from 14 percent in 1932 to 52 percent in 1936.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Marion|title=Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=94\u2013118}}</ref> While most were happy that their children could learn, many parents feared that the segregation of the Jewish community from the Aryan community was a goal of the Nazis.\n<!-- Unsourced section. 2 million conflicts with prior estimate of 1.5 million.

To Be Shot as Dangerous Enemies of the Third Reich (1943), New York.jpg|thumb|''To Be Shot as Dangerous Enemies of the Third Reich'' (1943), by [[Arthur Szyk]]]]\nThe Germans and their collaborators killed as many as 2&nbsp;million children, including over a million Jewish children, hundreds of thousands of [[Poles|Polish]] children, and tens of thousands of [[Romani people|Romani]] children, in addition to children of various ethnicities with physical and mental disabilities living in institutions across the German-occupied Europe. Aside from Polish, Romani and Polish-Jewish children, many Jewish children from France, the Netherlands, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and other countries also died as a result of mass deportations. The chances for survival for Jewish and some non-Jewish adolescents (13\u201318 years old) were greater, as they could be deployed at forced labor. The other children, usually infants or otherwise younger than adolescents, were disposed of in killing chambers such as gas-filled rooms or merely shot to fulfill the Germans' \"Final Solution\" to exterminate the Jews. Inside concentration camps, the presence of children was virtually nonexistent; they were killed instead. Experiments were also performed on children, especially twins. When the Holocaust ended and the Red Army found 9,000 survivors, only 451 were children.\n-->\n\n==Causes of death==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|width=175\n|image1=Bundesarchiv N 1576 Bild-003, Warschau, Bettelnde Kinder.jpg\n|caption1=Ghetto children\n<!-- Commented out: |image2=Childwarsawghetto.jpg -->\n|caption2=A child dying in the streets of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] 19 September 1941\n}}\n\nGerman forces established [[ghetto]]s early in the war in many Polish towns and cities such as [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. In them, Jewish children died from starvation and exposure as well as lack of adequate clothing and shelter. The German authorities were indifferent to this mass death because they considered most of the younger ghetto children to be unproductive and hence \"useless eaters\". Strict control was enforced over the inhabitants of the ghettos, and the food provided was deliberately limited. From 1942 onwards, the ghetto program ended. Inhabitants of the ghettos were murdered at various [[death camp]]s. Because children were generally too young to be deployed as forced labor, they were particularly vulnerable to being killed: they were one of the main groups in the first deportations to [[Nazi extermination camps|killing centers]] or in mass shootings near mass graves along with the elderly, the ill, and the disabled.<ref>[http://www.fightdemback.org/2008/02/11/doin-it-for-the-kids/ Doin\u2019 it for the kids!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516235751/http://www.fightdemback.org/2008/02/11/doin-it-for-the-kids/ |date=16 May 2008 }}</ref> Children who were healthy enough for labor were often worked to death doing jobs to benefit the camp; other times, children were forced to do unnecessary jobs like digging ditches.\n\nNon-Jewish children from certain other targeted groups were not spared. In the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], Romani children were killed. Meanwhile, five to seven thousand children died as victims of a \"euthanasia\" program. Others were murdered in reprisals, including most of the children of [[Lidice massacre|Lidice]]; many children in villages in the occupied parts of the Soviet Union were killed with their parents.<ref name=\"CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST\">{{Cite web |url=http://www1.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 |title=CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST |access-date=5 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012037/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 |archive-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \nDuring the Holocaust, children were more susceptible to the harm they were going to face because of the vulnerable state they were in. More than 1.5 million Jews died in the Holocaust. There are only few children that were saved in the war through programs such as Kinderspart and One Thousand Holocaust. Other children survived on their own by staying in the concentration camps or in the ghetto.\n\n== Medical incidents ==\n[[File:Children headed for deportation.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Ghetto Litzmannstadt]]. Children rounded up for deportation to the [[Chelmno extermination camp|Kulmhof extermination camp]].]]\n[[File:66935A.jpeg|thumb|Jewish twins kept alive to be used in Mengele's medical experiments. These children were liberated from Auschwitz by the Red Army in January 1945.]]\n\nThe German authorities also incarcerated a number of children in concentration camps and transit camps. Physicians and medical researchers of the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), a Nazi paramilitary organization, used children, especially twins, in concentration camps for medical experiments that often resulted in the deaths of the children.\n\nIn their \"search to retrieve 'Aryan blood'\", or the perfect race, SS race experts ordered hundreds of children in occupied Poland and the occupied parts of the [[Soviet Union]] to be kidnapped and transferred to the Reich to be adopted by racially suitable German families. Although the basis for these decisions was \"race-scientific,\" often blond hair, blue eyes, or fair skin was sufficient to merit the \"opportunity\" to be \"Germanized.\" On the other hand, female Poles and Soviet civilians who had been deported to Germany for forced labor were often forced sexual relations with a German man; many cases resulted in pregnancy, and the women were forced to have abortions or to bear their children under conditions that would ensure the infant's death, if the race experts determined that the child would have insufficient German blood.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.projetaladin.org/en/children-and-the-holocaust.html |title=Children During the Holocaust |access-date=1 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401180707/http://www.projetaladin.org/en/children-and-the-holocaust.html |archive-date=1 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Transit camps ==\nTransit camps were temporary stops on the way to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Many children were brought with their families to transit camps, unsure of what awaited them. Some hoped for starting a new life and making friends in the camps, while many others were scared. Children brought to the transit camps came from many different backgrounds.\n\nIn the transit camps, children were surrounded by bare bodies. Their beds were merely metal frames. There was a lack of food along with a fear of trains coming for deportation. No school supplies were provided. Children began to see their relatives in a different light because each family member dealt with various hardships in the transit camps.<ref name=\":1\">Dwork, Deborah. \"Transit Camps.\" Children with a Star: Jewish Youth in Nazi Europe, Yale University Press, 1993, pp. 113\u2013154.</ref>\n\nChildren had few resources at the transit camps to foster growth. A group of Hungarian [[Zionism|Zionists]] made a rescue committee to negotiate and prevent deportations. Older girls took care of young children. Physicians, nurses, and musicians organized lectures, concerts, and activities for children.<ref name=\":1\" /> Voluntary interns and philanthropic organizations supplied food, clothing, and organized secretive teaching rooms to help the children continue their education. Childcare workers taught children about the ideas of Zionism and the spirit of democracy; they additionally encouraged an affectionate atmosphere. These groups also helped ease the hunger issues in the camps.\n\nA notorious case of the Nazis holding a child in a transit camp is the case of [[Anne Frank]] and her sister in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Other notable cases include the children held in the [[Majdanek concentration camp]], some of whom were orphaned because their parents were killed in anti-partisan operations.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol7_00014.html \"Lublin\" chapter from Pinkas Hakehillot Polin (cont.)]</ref>\n\n== Auschwitz and Josef Mengele ==\n[[File:Czeslawa Kwoka - Brasse.jpg|thumb|[[Czes\u0142awa Kwoka]], child victim in Auschwitz]]\n[[Josef Mengele]] was a physician who worked at [[Auschwitz]], a concentration camp. His research subjects were better fed and housed than other prisoners and temporarily safe from the gas chambers.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=57}} He established a kindergarten for children who were the subjects of experiments, along with all Romani children under the age of six. The facility provided better food and living conditions than other areas of the camp and even included a playground.{{sfn|Kubica|1998|pp=320\u2013321}} When visiting his child subjects, he introduced himself as \"Uncle Mengele\" and offered them sweets.{{sfn|Lagnado|Dekel|1991|p=9}} However, he was also personally responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of victims.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=341}} Author [[Robert Jay Lifton]] describes Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely anti-Semitic, claiming that he believed that the Jews should be eliminated entirely as an inferior and dangerous race.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=376\u2013377}} Mengele's son Rolf said that his father showed no remorse for his wartime activities.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=48}} A lack of regulations on his experiments allowed Mengele to perform his experiments freely.\n\nA former Auschwitz prisoner doctor said:\n\n{{quote|He was capable of being so kind to the children, to have them become fond of him, to bring them sugar, to think of small details in their daily lives, and to do things we would genuinely admire&nbsp;... And then, next to that,&nbsp;... the crematoria smoke, and these children, tomorrow or in a half-hour, he is going to send them there. Well, that is where the anomaly lay.{{sfn|Lifton|1985|p=337}} }}\n\n[[File:WP Josef Mengele 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Photo from Mengele's Argentine identification document (1956)]]\n\nMengele had a fascination with twins. He was interested in the difference between identical and fraternal twins as well as how genetic diseases affected them and where they originated. The experiments also distinguished between genetic traits and those developed by the environment of the child. Mengele was known to pretend to be off duty while a train of new prisoners arrived so that he could personally select any twins whom he saw. He operated on children, partly to find genetic weaknesses in the makeup of Jewish or Romani people in order to provide scientific evidence for the ideas of the Nazi party. Mengele hypothesized that his subjects were particularly vulnerable to certain diseases because of their race. In addition to that, he believed that they had degenerative blood and tissue based on his samples.<ref name=\"Josef Mengele\">{{cite web |title=Josef Mengele |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nMengele or one of his assistants subjected twins to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=350}} He performed experiments such as unnecessary amputation of limbs; in another experiment, he intentionally infected a twin with [[typhus]] or another disease and transfused the blood of the infected twin into the other one. Many of his subjects died while undergoing these procedures.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=37}} After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=351}} [[Mikl\u00f3s Nyiszli]], a prisoner at Auschwitz, recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night through a [[chloroform]] injection to the heart.{{sfn|Lifton|1985}} If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative reports could be prepared after their deaths.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=347, 353}}\n\nHe was known for experimenting with eyes. One of his particular studies regarded [[heterochromia iridum]], a condition where people's eyes are differently colored.<ref name=\"Josef Mengele\"/> After he killed heterochromatics, he removed their eyes and sent them to Berlin for study. Another of Mengele's experiments with eyes involved attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals into the eyes of living subjects.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=362}} His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays.{{sfn|Astor|1985|p=102}} Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=360}} Mengele sought pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to gas chambers.{{sfn|Brozan|1982}} Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back-to-back in an attempt to create [[conjoined twins]].{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=37}} The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.{{sfn|Mozes-Kor|1992|p=57}}\n\n==Sisak concentration camp==\n{{Main|Sisak children's concentration camp}} {{summarize|from|Sisak children's concentration camp|better=y|section=y|date=March 2018}}\nDuring the existence of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during [[World War II]], [[Usta\u0161e|the Croatian Usta\u0161e]] established numerous concentration camps like those in [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=6711|publisher=Jasenovac Memorial Site|title=List of individual victims of Jasenovac concentration camp|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> [[\u0110akovo concentration camp|\u0110akovo]],<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=ABSEES|title=ABSEES - Soviet and East European Abstracts Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdpXAAAAYAAJ|date=January 1973|publisher=ABSEES}}</ref> and [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7384| title = Jastrebarsko Camp| author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| website = www.jusp-jasenovac.hr| publisher = Jasenovac Memorial Site| access-date = 11 September 2016| ref = {{harvid|Jasenovac Memorial Site}}}}</ref> in which many [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and [[Romani people|Romani]] children died as inmates.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fumi\u0107|first = Ivan|title = Djeca&nbsp;\u2014 \u017ertve usta\u0161kog re\u017eima|trans-title = Child Victims of the Usta\u0161e Regime|year = 2011| publisher = Savez antifasistickih borca I antifasista republike Hrvatske [Union of Anti-Fascist Fighters and Anti-Fascists of the Republic of Croatia]| location = Zagreb, Croatia| isbn = 978-953-7587-09-3| ref = harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference| title = Zlo\u010dini okupatora i njegovih saradnika nad decom kozarskog podru\u010dja 1941\u20131945. godine| trans-title = The Crimes of the Occupiers and their Collaborators Against Children in the Kozara region 1941\u20131945| last = Luki\u0107| first = Dragoje| conference = Kozara u narodnooslobodila\u010dkoj borbi i socijalisti\u010dkoj revoluciji (1941\u20131945) [Kozara in the National Liberation War and Socialist Revolution: (1941\u20131945)] (27&nbsp;\u2013 28 October 1977)| publisher = Nacionalni park \"Kozara\"| year = 1980| pages = 269\u2013284| location = Prijedor, Yugoslavia| oclc = 10076276| ref = harv}}</ref> Among them, there was Sisak concentration camp, which was specially formed for children as part of Jasenovac concentration camp.<ref>Marija Vuselica: Regionen Kroatien in Der Ort des Terrors: Arbeitserziehungslager, Ghettos, Jugendschutzlager, Polizeihaftlager, Sonderlager, Zigeunerlager, Zwangsarbeiterlager, Volume 9 of Der Ort des Terrors, Publisher\tC.H.Beck, 2009, {{ISBN|9783406572388}} pages 321-323</ref><ref>Anna Maria Gr\u00fcnfelder: Arbeitseinsatz f\u00fcr die Neuordnung Europas: Zivil- und ZwangsarbeiterInnen aus Jugoslawien in der \"Ostmark\" 1938/41-1945, Publisher B\u00f6hlau Verlag Wien, 2010 {{ISBN|9783205784531}} pages 101-106</ref>\n[[Image:Children in Sisak concentration camp.jpg|thumb|Children in [[Sisak children's concentration camp]]]]\n\n[[Sisak children's concentration camp]] was founded on 3 August 1942 following the [[Kozara Offensive]].<ref name=\"JMCSisakCamp\">{{cite web|title=SISAK CAMP|url=http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7375|website=Jasenovac Memorial Cite|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> It was part of an assembly camp, officially named the \"Refugee Transit Camp\".<ref name=\"JMCSisakCamp\"/> This concentration camp consisted of a special part officially called the \"Shelter for the Refugee Children\" under the auspices of the \"Ustasha Female Lineage\" and \"Ustasha Security Service\", and under the direct control of [[Antun Naj\u017eer]]. The camp was located in several buildings in [[Sisak]]: the former Yugoslav Falconry Association (\"Sokolana\"), the Sisters of St. Vincent nunnery, a rice warehouse, Rajs Saltworks warehouse, Novi Sisak elementary school, and the \"Karantena\" (Quarantine). All these buildings were considered unsuitable for the housing of children.{{according to whom|date=November 2019}} For example, in the Falconry Association, there were no doors; it was drafty because it was built for drying salt. Children, even those who were only a few months old, had to lie on the floor with only a thin layer of straw without any clothes or blankets. When a typhus epidemic broke out, Naj\u017eer ordered the transfer of the infected children to an improvised hospital, only serving to increase the number of deaths.\n\nThe first group of children arrived on 3 August 1942;<ref name=\"JMCSisakCamp\"/> there were 906 of them. The very next day another group of 650 children was brought; a third group arrived on 6 August with 1,272 children. In Teslic glasshouse and the newly built barracks, which were named \"Karantena\", a general concentration camp for men, women, and children had been established. During August and September 1942, Usta\u0161e took parents away from 3,971 children by sending the parents to forced labor. From August 1942 to 8 February 1943, there were 6,693 detained children, mostly Serbs from [[Kozara]], [[Kordun]], and [[Slavonia]].

Not far from the ambulance, from another barracks, the sad cries of the children were heard. There was set, on the bare floor, four hundred children: newborns, children from a few weeks or months, up to ten years of age. How many children came, and where they were dispatched, could no longer be found out. The children in the children's barracks cried inexorably and were calling their mothers, who were only a few steps away from the children, but the fascist criminals did not let mothers to approach their children. Older children tell us through tears, that they can not calm the little ones, because they are hungry, there are no one to change diapers of the little ones, and they are afraid that everyone will die. These children, who have not yet reached the age of ten, swear to us, \"Come on, sister, bring us mothers, bring at least mothers to these little ones. You will see, if you do not bring them their mothers, they will suffocate, by the tears alone.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nCoroner David Egi\u0107 officially recorded that out of 6,693 children, 1,152 died in the Camp, while teacher Ante Dumbovi\u0107 later claimed that the number was 1,630.<ref name=\"JMCSisakCamp\"/><ref>Review of International Affairs, Volume 33, Issues 762-785, Federation of Yugoslav Journalists, 1982 page 31</ref>\n\n==Means of survival==\nIn spite of their acute vulnerability, many children discovered ways to survive. Children smuggled food and medicine into the ghettos, in turn smuggling out their own personal possessions to trade for said goods. Children in youth movements later escaped the ghettos to join underground resistance activities such as Soviet partisan units; others formed their own units to harass the German occupiers.

Inspired by the [[Kindertransport]], Congress was urged to allow up to 100,000 Jewish children to come to America. Efforts around the United States allowed the rescue of 1,000 Jewish children from Nazis. Unlike the English work, the actual rescue efforts were not backed up by the government in any way.

According to estimations, 1.5&nbsp;million children, nearly all [[Jews|Jewish]], were murdered during the Holocaust, either directly or as a direct consequence of Nazi actions.\n \nThe Nazis advocated killing children of unwanted or \"dangerous\" groups in accordance with their ideological views, either as part of the Nazi idea of the racial struggle or as a measure of preventive security. The Nazis particularly targeted Jewish children, but also targeted ethnically [[Poles|Polish]] children and [[Romani people|Romani]] (also called Gypsy) children along with children with mental or physical defects (disabled children). The Nazis and their collaborators killed children both for these ideological reasons and in retaliation for real or alleged partisan attacks.<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST]</ref> Early killings were encouraged by the Nazis in [[action T4]], where children with disabilities were gassed using [[carbon monoxide]], starved to death, given [[phenol]] injections to the heart, or [[hanging|hanged]].\n\n1,500,000 children, nearly all Jewish, were killed by the Nazis. A much smaller number were saved. Some simply survived, often in a [[ghetto]], occasionally in a [[concentration camp]]. Some were saved in various programs like the [[Kindertransport]] and the [[One Thousand Children]], in both of which children fled their homeland. Other children were saved by becoming [[Hidden Children]]. During and even before the war many vulnerable children were rescued by [[\u0152uvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE).\n\n== Segregation in schools ==\nSegregation in schools began in April 1933 when the \"Law Against Overcrowding in German schools\" was enacted. A restriction was set that allowed only 1.5 percent of [[Jews|Jewish]] children to be enrolled in public schools; at the time, five percent of the children in Germany were of Jewish descent.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Nazism|Nazi]]s continued to \"Aryanize\" as their regime progressed. Jewish children were required to learn from different sources than their classmates. Many Jewish children were also given worse grades than their peers, indiscriminately with regards to the quality of their work. Jewish children were not allowed to participate in most school activities; many were segregated from former friends. As time passed, most teachers incorporated more elements of the Nazi ideology in their classrooms; once quieter in their beliefs, they started using anti-Semitic terms in class.<ref name=\":0\" /> Poor treatment of Jewish children was more common in rural schools, but there was also discrimination in large cities.\n\nMany Jewish students felt distant from their classmates. Some Jewish children began to form small strikes in their schools, leaving without permission during class when anti-Semitic elements were used. Others tried to conform with no success, and some parents just took their children out of school.

Mothers were more likely to take their children out of school than fathers, seeing and hearing from their children the majority of what actually happened at school.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEventually Jewish schools were built, and the Jewish community supported the idea of teaching their children without fear of persecution.

Aside from Polish, Romani and Polish-Jewish children, many Jewish children from France, the Netherlands, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and other countries also died as a result of mass deportations. The chances for survival for Jewish and some non-Jewish adolescents (13\u201318 years old) were greater, as they could be deployed at forced labor. The other children, usually infants or otherwise younger than adolescents, were disposed of in killing chambers such as gas-filled rooms or merely shot to fulfill the Germans' \"Final Solution\" to exterminate the Jews. Inside concentration camps, the presence of children was virtually nonexistent; they were killed instead. Experiments were also performed on children, especially twins. When the Holocaust ended and the Red Army found 9,000 survivors, only 451 were children.\n-->\n\n==Causes of death==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|width=175\n|image1=Bundesarchiv N 1576 Bild-003, Warschau, Bettelnde Kinder.jpg\n|caption1=Ghetto children\n<!-- Commented out: |image2=Childwarsawghetto.jpg -->\n|caption2=A child dying in the streets of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] 19 September 1941\n}}\n\nGerman forces established [[ghetto]]s early in the war in many Polish towns and cities such as [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. In them, Jewish children died from starvation and exposure as well as lack of adequate clothing and shelter. The German authorities were indifferent to this mass death because they considered most of the younger ghetto children to be unproductive and hence \"useless eaters\". Strict control was enforced over the inhabitants of the ghettos, and the food provided was deliberately limited. From 1942 onwards, the ghetto program ended. Inhabitants of the ghettos were murdered at various [[death camp]]s. Because children were generally too young to be deployed as forced labor, they were particularly vulnerable to being killed: they were one of the main groups in the first deportations to [[Nazi extermination camps|killing centers]] or in mass shootings near mass graves along with the elderly, the ill, and the disabled.<ref>[http://www.fightdemback.org/2008/02/11/doin-it-for-the-kids/ Doin\u2019 it for the kids!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516235751/http://www.fightdemback.org/2008/02/11/doin-it-for-the-kids/ |date=16 May 2008 }}</ref> Children who were healthy enough for labor were often worked to death doing jobs to benefit the camp; other times, children were forced to do unnecessary jobs like digging ditches.\n\nNon-Jewish children from certain other targeted groups were not spared. In the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], Romani children were killed. Meanwhile, five to seven thousand children died as victims of a \"euthanasia\" program. Others were murdered in reprisals, including most of the children of [[Lidice massacre|Lidice]]; many children in villages in the occupied parts of the Soviet Union were killed with their parents.<ref name=\"CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST\">{{Cite web |url=http://www1.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 |title=CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST |access-date=5 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012037/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 |archive-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \nDuring the Holocaust, children were more susceptible to the harm they were going to face because of the vulnerable state they were in. More than 1.5 million Jews died in the Holocaust. There are only few children that were saved in the war through programs such as Kinderspart and One Thousand Holocaust. Other children survived on their own by staying in the concentration camps or in the ghetto.\n\n== Medical incidents ==\n[[File:Children headed for deportation.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Ghetto Litzmannstadt]]. Children rounded up for deportation to the [[Chelmno extermination camp|Kulmhof extermination camp]].]]\n[[File:66935A.jpeg|thumb|Jewish twins kept alive to be used in Mengele's medical experiments. These children were liberated from Auschwitz by the Red Army in January 1945.]]\n\nThe German authorities also incarcerated a number of children in concentration camps and transit camps. Physicians and medical researchers of the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), a Nazi paramilitary organization, used children, especially twins, in concentration camps for medical experiments that often resulted in the deaths of the children.\n\nIn their \"search to retrieve 'Aryan blood'\", or the perfect race, SS race experts ordered hundreds of children in occupied Poland and the occupied parts of the [[Soviet Union]] to be kidnapped and transferred to the Reich to be adopted by racially suitable German families. Although the basis for these decisions was \"race-scientific,\" often blond hair, blue eyes, or fair skin was sufficient to merit the \"opportunity\" to be \"Germanized.\" On the other hand, female Poles and Soviet civilians who had been deported to Germany for forced labor were often forced sexual relations with a German man; many cases resulted in pregnancy, and the women were forced to have abortions or to bear their children under conditions that would ensure the infant's death, if the race experts determined that the child would have insufficient German blood.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.projetaladin.org/en/children-and-the-holocaust.html |title=Children During the Holocaust |access-date=1 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401180707/http://www.projetaladin.org/en/children-and-the-holocaust.html |archive-date=1 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Transit camps ==\nTransit camps were temporary stops on the way to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Many children were brought with their families to transit camps, unsure of what awaited them. Some hoped for starting a new life and making friends in the camps, while many others were scared. Children brought to the transit camps came from many different backgrounds.\n\nIn the transit camps, children were surrounded by bare bodies. Their beds were merely metal frames. There was a lack of food along with a fear of trains coming for deportation. No school supplies were provided. Children began to see their relatives in a different light because each family member dealt with various hardships in the transit camps.<ref name=\":1\">Dwork, Deborah. \"Transit Camps.\" Children with a Star: Jewish Youth in Nazi Europe, Yale University Press, 1993, pp. 113\u2013154.</ref>\n\nChildren had few resources at the transit camps to foster growth. A group of Hungarian [[Zionism|Zionists]] made a rescue committee to negotiate and prevent deportations. Older girls took care of young children. Physicians, nurses, and musicians organized lectures, concerts, and activities for children.<ref name=\":1\" /> Voluntary interns and philanthropic organizations supplied food, clothing, and organized secretive teaching rooms to help the children continue their education. Childcare workers taught children about the ideas of Zionism and the spirit of democracy; they additionally encouraged an affectionate atmosphere. These groups also helped ease the hunger issues in the camps.\n\nA notorious case of the Nazis holding a child in a transit camp is the case of [[Anne Frank]] and her sister in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Other notable cases include the children held in the [[Majdanek concentration camp]], some of whom were orphaned because their parents were killed in anti-partisan operations.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol7_00014.html \"Lublin\" chapter from Pinkas Hakehillot Polin (cont.)]</ref>\n\n== Auschwitz and Josef Mengele ==\n[[File:Czeslawa Kwoka - Brasse.jpg|thumb|[[Czes\u0142awa Kwoka]], child victim in Auschwitz]]\n[[Josef Mengele]] was a physician who worked at [[Auschwitz]], a concentration camp.

He was interested in the difference between identical and fraternal twins as well as how genetic diseases affected them and where they originated. The experiments also distinguished between genetic traits and those developed by the environment of the child. Mengele was known to pretend to be off duty while a train of new prisoners arrived so that he could personally select any twins whom he saw. He operated on children, partly to find genetic weaknesses in the makeup of Jewish or Romani people in order to provide scientific evidence for the ideas of the Nazi party. Mengele hypothesized that his subjects were particularly vulnerable to certain diseases because of their race. In addition to that, he believed that they had degenerative blood and tissue based on his samples.<ref name=\"Josef Mengele\">{{cite web |title=Josef Mengele |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nMengele or one of his assistants subjected twins to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=350}} He performed experiments such as unnecessary amputation of limbs; in another experiment, he intentionally infected a twin with [[typhus]] or another disease and transfused the blood of the infected twin into the other one. Many of his subjects died while undergoing these procedures.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=37}} After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=351}} [[Mikl\u00f3s Nyiszli]], a prisoner at Auschwitz, recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night through a [[chloroform]] injection to the heart.{{sfn|Lifton|1985}} If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative reports could be prepared after their deaths.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=347, 353}}\n\nHe was known for experimenting with eyes. One of his particular studies regarded [[heterochromia iridum]], a condition where people's eyes are differently colored.<ref name=\"Josef Mengele\"/> After he killed heterochromatics, he removed their eyes and sent them to Berlin for study. Another of Mengele's experiments with eyes involved attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals into the eyes of living subjects.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=362}} His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays.{{sfn|Astor|1985|p=102}} Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=360}} Mengele sought pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to gas chambers.{{sfn|Brozan|1982}} Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back-to-back in an attempt to create [[conjoined twins]].{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=37}} The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.{{sfn|Mozes-Kor|1992|p=57}}\n\n==Sisak concentration camp==\n{{Main|Sisak children's concentration camp}} {{summarize|from|Sisak children's concentration camp|better=y|section=y|date=March 2018}}\nDuring the existence of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during [[World War II]], [[Usta\u0161e|the Croatian Usta\u0161e]] established numerous concentration camps like those in [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=6711|publisher=Jasenovac Memorial Site|title=List of individual victims of Jasenovac concentration camp|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> [[\u0110akovo concentration camp|\u0110akovo]],<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=ABSEES|title=ABSEES - Soviet and East European Abstracts Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdpXAAAAYAAJ|date=January 1973|publisher=ABSEES}}</ref> and [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7384| title = Jastrebarsko Camp| author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| website = www.jusp-jasenovac.hr| publisher = Jasenovac Memorial Site| access-date = 11 September 2016| ref = {{harvid|Jasenovac Memorial Site}}}}</ref> in which many [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and [[Romani people|Romani]] children died as inmates.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fumi\u0107|first = Ivan|title = Djeca&nbsp;\u2014 \u017ertve usta\u0161kog re\u017eima|trans-title = Child Victims of the Usta\u0161e Regime|year = 2011| publisher = Savez antifasistickih borca I antifasista republike Hrvatske [Union of Anti-Fascist Fighters and Anti-Fascists of the Republic of Croatia]| location = Zagreb, Croatia| isbn = 978-953-7587-09-3| ref = harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference| title = Zlo\u010dini okupatora i njegovih saradnika nad decom kozarskog podru\u010dja 1941\u20131945. godine| trans-title = The Crimes of the Occupiers and their Collaborators Against Children in the Kozara region 1941\u20131945| last = Luki\u0107| first = Dragoje| conference = Kozara u narodnooslobodila\u010dkoj borbi i socijalisti\u010dkoj revoluciji (1941\u20131945) [Kozara in the National Liberation War and Socialist Revolution: (1941\u20131945)] (27&nbsp;\u2013 28 October 1977)| publisher = Nacionalni park \"Kozara\"| year = 1980| pages = 269\u2013284| location = Prijedor, Yugoslavia| oclc = 10076276| ref = harv}}</ref> Among them, there was Sisak concentration camp, which was specially formed for children as part of Jasenovac concentration camp.<ref>Marija Vuselica: Regionen Kroatien in Der Ort des Terrors: Arbeitserziehungslager, Ghettos, Jugendschutzlager, Polizeihaftlager, Sonderlager, Zigeunerlager, Zwangsarbeiterlager, Volume 9 of Der Ort des Terrors, Publisher\tC.H.Beck, 2009, {{ISBN|9783406572388}} pages 321-323</ref><ref>Anna Maria Gr\u00fcnfelder: Arbeitseinsatz f\u00fcr die Neuordnung Europas: Zivil- und ZwangsarbeiterInnen aus Jugoslawien in der \"Ostmark\" 1938/41-1945, Publisher B\u00f6hlau Verlag Wien, 2010 {{ISBN|9783205784531}} pages 101-106</ref>\n[[Image:Children in Sisak concentration camp.jpg|thumb|Children in [[Sisak children's concentration camp]]]]\n\n[[Sisak children's concentration camp]] was founded on 3 August 1942 following the [[Kozara Offensive]].<ref name=\"JMCSisakCamp\">{{cite web|title=SISAK CAMP|url=http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7375|website=Jasenovac Memorial Cite|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> It was part of an assembly camp, officially named the \"Refugee Transit Camp\".<ref name=\"JMCSisakCamp\"/> This concentration camp consisted of a special part officially called the \"Shelter for the Refugee Children\" under the auspices of the \"Ustasha Female Lineage\" and \"Ustasha Security Service\", and under the direct control of [[Antun Naj\u017eer]].

All these buildings were considered unsuitable for the housing of children.{{according to whom|date=November 2019}} For example, in the Falconry Association, there were no doors; it was drafty because it was built for drying salt. Children, even those who were only a few months old, had to lie on the floor with only a thin layer of straw without any clothes or blankets.

Youth Aliyah continued its activities after the war by helping child survivors to move to Palestine, which soon became the state of Israel in 1948.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1396144 Dalia Ofer, Holocaust Survivors as Immigrants: The Case of Israel and the Cyprus Detainees]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020819225247/http://www.motl.org/resource/curriculum/curriculum_12.htm Shivat Tzion- The Return to Zion]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bullenhuser Damm]]\n*[[Joseph Mengele]]\n*[[Kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nicholas Winton]]\n*[[Janusz Korczak]]\n*[[Bia\u0142ystok children]]\n*[[One Thousand Children]]\n\n<!-- Comment out until we can actually make a sources section\n==Sources==\n:''This article incorporates text from the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], and has been released under the [[GFDL]].''\n-->\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Child Holocaust victims}}\n*[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/nochildsplay/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki \u201cNo Child\u2019s Play\u201d \u2013 Children in the Holocaust: Creativity and Play] an online exhibition by [[Yad Vashem]]\n*[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] \u2013 Article [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005142 Children during the Holocaust]; and online exhibitions [https://web.archive.org/web/20041021163434/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/hiddenchildren/index/ Life in the Shadows]; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20130912124330/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/lodz/ Give Me Your Children]\n*[http://isurvived.org/Memorial-CHILDREN.html Holocaust Memorial Album Honoring more than 1.5 Million Souls Under 12 years of age that never returned ...] from Holocaust Survivors and Remembrance Project: \"Forget You Not\" \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090414221035/http://frank.mtsu.edu/~baustin/children.html Children and the Holocaust]\n*[http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/allies-bomb-northern-nazi-germany.htm/printable Nazis kidnap Polish children]\n\n[[Category:Children in the Holocaust| ]]\n[[Category:Children in war|Holocaust]]\n[[Category:Death of children|Holocaust]]\n", "name_user": "2605:6000:1513:4185:1036:a5e9:629d:7f95", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(pooooop)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_the_Holocaust"}

He was loosely based on real-life [[Baltimore]] homicide detective Thomas Pellegrini, featured in [[David Simon]]'s book ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]'',<ref>[http://citypaper.com/news/homicide-revisited-1.1598673 Smith, Van. \"Homicide, Revisited,\" ''Baltimore City Paper'', December 10, 2013.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213111457/http://citypaper.com/news/homicide-revisited-1.1598673 |date=December 13, 2013 }}</ref> though Pellegrini was reportedly not at all a fan of his fictional alter ego. The character also appeared in the ''[[Law & Order]]'' episode \"Charm City.\"\n\n==Childhood and early life==\nBorn on May 31, 1960 in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], Bayliss had a difficult and often contentious relationship with his family. Growing up he was very close with his cousins Jim and Kurt. In Season 3, after Jim shot and killed a [[Turkey|Turkish]] exchange student, Bayliss tried to shoehorn himself into his partner [[Frank Pembleton]]'s investigation. Pembleton learned that Kurt was killed during the [[Persian Gulf War]] and that Kurt and Jim's father was [[racism|racist]]. The case went to a [[grand jury]], which voted not to [[indictment|indict]] Jim. In Season 4, Bayliss briefly mentioned having a six-year-old niece.<ref>''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' episode \"Work Related\", originally aired May 17, 1996.</ref> His [[Undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] [[Minor (academic)|minor]] was in [[drama]].<ref>''Homicide: Life on the Street'' episode \"Homicide.com\", originally aired February 5, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn Season 5, Bayliss revealed to Pembleton that he had been [[child molestation|molested]] as a child by one of his uncles. When he told his father what had happened, the elder Bayliss accused him of lying and the relationship remained hostile until his father's death. Bayliss told Det. [[Meldrick Lewis]] that he was once arrested for protesting U.S. policy in El Salvador when he was a teenager, a story idea that Secor reportedly disdained as out of character for Bayliss. It was quickly discarded in favor of the character developments for Seasons 5\u20137, including his abuse history and religious journey.\n\n==Religion==\nUnlike several characters in the series, religion was not important in Bayliss's family background. When asked, he stated he had been raised \"mutt.\" In this case that meant his family attended several different denominations, most of which could be termed \"Mainline Protestant,\" but they had no attachment to any of them. Bayliss states that he was baptized into the Presbyterian Church and confirmed in the Episcopal Church. He briefly joined [[Unitarian Universalism]] for a girlfriend, but seems to have not been particularly sincere about it. He converted to Buddhism in the final season but eventually lost faith.\n\n== Adena Watson case ==\nTim Bayliss had originally worked for the mayor's security, but his ambition had been to work at [[Homicide]]. His first case as primary detective was the rape-murder of Adena Watson, and he was never able to close it. This case haunted him throughout the series, but particularly in the first four seasons. At times, it led to friction between himself and his partner, [[Frank Pembleton]], who scolded him for putting too much of himself into his cases. In the Season 4 episode \"Stakeout,\" he learns that Risley Tucker ([[Moses Gunn]]), an [[arabber]] who was the prime suspect, has died of natural causes. Pembleton and Bayliss had put Risley through a long interrogation in hopes of getting him to admit his guilt, but without success.\n\nThe Season 4 episode, \"Requiem for Adena\", centers on the murder of a young black girl that shows similarities to the Adena Watson case. Bayliss becomes obsessed with the idea that the two cases are connected, to the point that his actions begin to jeopardize Pembleton's efforts to get a confession. He learns that many of the people connected with Adena and/or Tucker have moved on from her death much better than he has, and states that he has begun to hate Adena because he cannot do so himself. At the end of the episode, he takes a framed photo of her from his desk (where it had stood ever since that investigation wound down), packs it into an envelope with a [[carnation]] from his lapel, and drops the envelope into a trash can.\n\nIn the Season 6 episode \"Finnegan's Wake\", Bayliss wrestles anew with the Watson case when he learns about the longest-running unsolved homicide on the BPD's books, the rape and murder in 1932 of a little girl named Clara Slone. Pembleton tells Tim that the senior detectives all decided to not tell him about the Slone case because it strongly echoed Adena Watson's case, not least because the lead detective in 1932 was a very young cop who saw the case quickly spiral out of his control. Tim is having dreams about the case, and tells the retired cop who helps Det. Falsone solve it that he wondered if he had true evil (the suspect, Risley Tucker) in his sights and let him get away.\n\n== Partnership with Pembleton ==\nThe partnership with Frank Pembleton would form a core element to the character and the entire show. Pembleton was by turns supportive and hurtful to Bayliss. He wanted to take a hard line on Bayliss's cousin who killed a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] exchange student, and also said that Bayliss lacked an understanding of \"his dark side\" so would do poorly in his job. Yet Pembleton also saved Bayliss from being charged in an incident that could have been interpreted as robbery, and once told him that he was the only person he trusted other than his wife, Mary. While Pembleton saw the world in strict black and white terms, Bayliss was far more open to accepting the shades of grey present in police work.\n\nThat said, the two ended their partnership for a time in the fifth season, partly due to Pembleton's stroke. Bayliss stated that Frank's rhythm was \"off\" after recovery, but there were also hints that he had come to prefer working without him. In addition, he felt uncomfortable with Pembleton after he told him how he (Bayliss) was sexually abused in childhood. The case in the episode featuring his admission (\"Betrayal\") involved a mother who allowed her boyfriend to beat her daughter from a previous marriage and was pregnant with the new boyfriend's child; Pembleton showed some sympathy to the woman's story, while Bayliss repeatedly and forcefully berated the woman for her reluctance to stop the ultimately-fatal abuse. Later, he returned to partnering with Pembleton due to Mary leaving Pembleton for a time. While working on a case in which a teenage girl murdered the stepfather who beat her mother, the two had very different views: while Pembleton is far more sympathetic to her, Bayliss is determined to see her charged with murder. Pembleton sees Tim's personal involvement and assures him that it is not his fault that he was abused. Following his stroke, Bayliss treats Pembleton in the same cold manner, often refusing to listen to his theories and indifferent to any attempts Pembleton made towards repairing their relationship, although this animosity had all but disappeared by the end of the fifth and start of the sixth season.\n\nPembleton left the force shortly after Bayliss was shot by a member of Georgia Rae Mahoney's gang in a gun battle. Pembleton met Bayliss's mother, Virginia, while Tim recovered from surgery. She told Frank what Tim thought of their friendship: \"He thinks the world of you. He says you're his friend. He says you're not a person who has friends, but he's your friend.\" Shortly afterwards, Pembleton and Mary say a prayer for Tim, during which Pembleton is visibly distraught (something he is almost never shown to be in the course of the show) and refers to Tim as his friend.\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn the first two seasons, Bayliss's character had been called a \"fair-haired choir boy\" and he stated once that he rejected the idea of having sex for any reason besides love. That started hints at having him \"lose his innocence,\" or questions of whether his claimed innocence was even genuine, occurred even then. Starting in the third season, the show's producers stated they wanted to more explicitly have him \"lose his innocence.\" Hence in season three he had an affair with crime scene specialist Emma Zoole, who liked having sex in a coffin.  She later broke up with him because he \"wouldn't fight with her.\" The statement had something of a double meaning as it directly involved his unwillingness to argue with her about their problems, but other aspects of the character implied she also was referring to his disdain for [[rough sex]]. The end of the relationship led to his pulling a gun on a store clerk in an irrational rage.\n\nIn later seasons he explored [[bisexuality]]. He did not \"[[coming out|come out]],\" in the standard sense, until season 7. In the first episode concerning the matter he flatly stated he was \"not [[gay]]\" and did not formally declare himself to be bisexual until Season 7, but even then he did not want to be deemed \"a crusader\" on the matter. This way of treating his sexuality is believed to have made the network uncomfortable.<ref>[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/reviews/3161/ New York Magazine]</ref> He had a fling with Dr. Cox and a semi-flirtation with Det. Ballard, and briefly dated a [[the closet|closeted]] uniform cop, but had no serious relationships in the final seasons of the show.\n\nDuring Season 6, Bayliss and Pembleton partnered again, and a drug war sparked by the killing of Baltimore drug kingpin Luther Mahoney led to brutal retaliation against the police department, including Mahoney's nephew, in custody, getting hold of an officer's gun and shooting up the squad room. Bayliss was among the detectives who shot down the gunman, and accompanied Pembleton and other members of the unit in carrying out the ensuing police response. During a gun battle, Pembleton froze when confronted by a suspect and Bayliss, who shoved him aside, was shot and severely wounded.  Pembleton, disgusted to find that fellow detective [[Mike Kellerman]] had deliberately shot Mahoney and would resign instead of being prosecuted, as well as grief-stricken over Bayliss's wounding, quit the force in disgust in the season finale.  Bayliss would return for Season 7, forever changed and foreshadowing his actions in that season.\n\nIn Season 7, having recovered from being shot, he converted to [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. At the end of the episode \"Zen and the Art of Murder\" it is implied he abandoned Buddhism as he feels having to shoot and kill a suspect who pulled a gun made him \"not a very good Buddhist.\" Bayliss' sexual orientation and religion had prompted him to develop a website, which was later shut down on request of Homicide Captain [[Roger Gaffney]]. In the series finale he is outraged when Luke Ryland, \"the Internet killer,\" escapes prosecution as the result of a legal snafu. Bayliss is later shown cleaning out his desk, with the implication that he is quitting the force, despite telling Giardello that he is merely doing some spring-cleaning. Ryland is found shot dead, execution-style, a while later.  In ''Homicide:  The Movie'' (2000), Bayliss was revealed to have taken an extended leave of absence, claiming that he had \"things to think about\" and issues (a point on which he is mocked by Meldrick Lewis). He returned to the force to solve Lieutenant Giardello's murder with the help of his old partner Pembleton; afterward, he confessed to Pembleton that he had indeed murdered Ryland, and asked Pembleton to turn him in.\n\nRyland's name is written on the Board in blue to indicate a closed, cold case. The circumstances leading up to that result (Bayliss' arrest or death) are not revealed, but Pembleton later comments that he caught two killers that night. In a Season 3 episode of ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', [[John Munch]] mentions he once had a partner who took cases too personally and ended up committing suicide; while he does not elaborate further, Munch was briefly partnered with Bayliss during the seventh season of ''Homicide''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Homicide: Life on the Street}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bayliss, Tim}}\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual males]]\n[[Category:Fictional Baltimore Police Department detectives]]\n[[Category:Homicide: Life on the Street characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| name       =  Timothy \"Tim\" Bayliss\n| image      = TimBayliss.jpg\n| image_size = 300px\n| caption    = Det.

At the end of the episode, he takes a framed photo of her from his desk (where it had stood ever since that investigation wound down), packs it into an envelope with a [[carnation]] from his lapel, and drops the envelope into a trash can.\n\nIn the Season 6 episode \"Finnegan's Wake\", Bayliss wrestles anew with the Watson case when he learns about the longest-running unsolved homicide on the BPD's books, the rape and murder in 1932 of a little girl named Clara Slone. Pembleton tells Tim that the senior detectives all decided to not tell him about the Slone case because it strongly echoed Adena Watson's case, not least because the lead detective in 1932 was a very young cop who saw the case quickly spiral out of his control. Tim is having dreams about the case, and tells the retired cop who helps Det. Falsone solve it that he wondered if he had true evil (the suspect, Risley Tucker) in his sights and let him get away.\n\n== Partnership with Pembleton ==\nThe partnership with Frank Pembleton would form a core element to the character and the entire show. Pembleton was by turns supportive and hurtful to Bayliss. He wanted to take a hard line on Bayliss's cousin who killed a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] exchange student, and also said that Bayliss lacked an understanding of \"his dark side\" so would do poorly in his job. Yet Pembleton also saved Bayliss from being charged in an incident that could have been interpreted as robbery, and once told him that he was the only person he trusted other than his wife, Mary. While Pembleton saw the world in strict black and white terms, Bayliss was far more open to accepting the shades of grey present in police work.\n\nThat said, the two ended their partnership for a time in the fifth season, partly due to Pembleton's stroke. Bayliss stated that Frank's rhythm was \"off\" after recovery, but there were also hints that he had come to prefer working without him. In addition, he felt uncomfortable with Pembleton after he told him how he (Bayliss) was sexually abused in childhood. The case in the episode featuring his admission (\"Betrayal\") involved a mother who allowed her boyfriend to beat her daughter from a previous marriage and was pregnant with the new boyfriend's child; Pembleton showed some sympathy to the woman's story, while Bayliss repeatedly and forcefully berated the woman for her reluctance to stop the ultimately-fatal abuse. Later, he returned to partnering with Pembleton due to Mary leaving Pembleton for a time. While working on a case in which a teenage girl murdered the stepfather who beat her mother, the two had very different views: while Pembleton is far more sympathetic to her, Bayliss is determined to see her charged with murder. Pembleton sees Tim's personal involvement and assures him that it is not his fault that he was abused. Following his stroke, Bayliss treats Pembleton in the same cold manner, often refusing to listen to his theories and indifferent to any attempts Pembleton made towards repairing their relationship, although this animosity had all but disappeared by the end of the fifth and start of the sixth season.\n\nPembleton left the force shortly after Bayliss was shot by a member of Georgia Rae Mahoney's gang in a gun battle. Pembleton met Bayliss's mother, Virginia, while Tim recovered from surgery. She told Frank what Tim thought of their friendship: \"He thinks the world of you. He says you're his friend. He says you're not a person who has friends, but he's your friend.\" Shortly afterwards, Pembleton and Mary say a prayer for Tim, during which Pembleton is visibly distraught (something he is almost never shown to be in the course of the show) and refers to Tim as his friend.\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn the first two seasons, Bayliss's character had been called a \"fair-haired choir boy\" and he stated once that he rejected the idea of having sex for any reason besides love. That started hints at having him \"lose his innocence,\" or questions of whether his claimed innocence was even genuine, occurred even then. Starting in the third season, the show's producers stated they wanted to more explicitly have him \"lose his innocence.\" Hence in season three he had an affair with crime scene specialist Emma Zoole, who liked having sex in a coffin.  She later broke up with him because he \"wouldn't fight with her.\" The statement had something of a double meaning as it directly involved his unwillingness to argue with her about their problems, but other aspects of the character implied she also was referring to his disdain for [[rough sex]]. The end of the relationship led to his pulling a gun on a store clerk in an irrational rage.\n\nIn later seasons he explored [[bisexuality]]. He did not \"[[coming out|come out]],\" in the standard sense, until season 7. In the first episode concerning the matter he flatly stated he was \"not [[gay]]\" and did not formally declare himself to be bisexual until Season 7, but even then he did not want to be deemed \"a crusader\" on the matter. This way of treating his sexuality is believed to have made the network uncomfortable.<ref>[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/reviews/3161/ New York Magazine]</ref> He had a fling with Dr. Cox and a semi-flirtation with Det. Ballard, and briefly dated a [[the closet|closeted]] uniform cop, but had no serious relationships in the final seasons of the show.\n\nDuring Season 6, Bayliss and Pembleton partnered again, and a drug war sparked by the killing of Baltimore drug kingpin Luther Mahoney led to brutal retaliation against the police department, including Mahoney's nephew, in custody, getting hold of an officer's gun and shooting up the squad room. Bayliss was among the detectives who shot down the gunman, and accompanied Pembleton and other members of the unit in carrying out the ensuing police response. During a gun battle, Pembleton froze when confronted by a suspect and Bayliss, who shoved him aside, was shot and severely wounded.  Pembleton, disgusted to find that fellow detective [[Mike Kellerman]] had deliberately shot Mahoney and would resign instead of being prosecuted, as well as grief-stricken over Bayliss's wounding, quit the force in disgust in the season finale.  Bayliss would return for Season 7, forever changed and foreshadowing his actions in that season.\n\nIn Season 7, having recovered from being shot, he converted to [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. At the end of the episode \"Zen and the Art of Murder\" it is implied he abandoned Buddhism as he feels having to shoot and kill a suspect who pulled a gun made him \"not a very good Buddhist.\" Bayliss' sexual orientation and religion had prompted him to develop a website, which was later shut down on request of Homicide Captain [[Roger Gaffney]]. In the series finale he is outraged when Luke Ryland, \"the Internet killer,\" escapes prosecution as the result of a legal snafu. Bayliss is later shown cleaning out his desk, with the implication that he is quitting the force, despite telling Giardello that he is merely doing some spring-cleaning. Ryland is found shot dead, execution-style, a while later.  In ''Homicide:  The Movie'' (2000), Bayliss was revealed to have taken an extended leave of absence, claiming that he had \"things to think about\" and issues (a point on which he is mocked by Meldrick Lewis). He returned to the force to solve Lieutenant Giardello's murder with the help of his old partner Pembleton; afterward, he confessed to Pembleton that he had indeed murdered Ryland, and asked Pembleton to turn him in.\n\nRyland's name is written on the Board in blue to indicate a closed, cold case. The circumstances leading up to that result (Bayliss' arrest or death) are not revealed, but Pembleton later comments that he caught two killers that night. In a Season 3 episode of ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', [[John Munch]] mentions he once had a partner who took cases too personally and ended up committing suicide; while he does not elaborate further, Munch was briefly partnered with Bayliss during the seventh season of ''Homicide''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Homicide: Life on the Street}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bayliss, Tim}}\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual males]]\n[[Category:Fictional Baltimore Police Department detectives]]\n[[Category:Homicide: Life on the Street characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters based on real people]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional suicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChildhood and early life:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 5-7 \u2192 5\u20137", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bayliss"}
