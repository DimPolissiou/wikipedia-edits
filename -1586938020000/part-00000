The Cavaliers and Hokies had a program-wide rivalry first called the ''Commonwealth Challenge'' (2005\u20132007) which UVA swept 2\u20130 before ending the series in a show of sportsmanship following the [[Virginia Tech massacre]].

Under the ''Challenge'' rules, UVA would have won the 2016\u201317 competition outright on points, 12\u201310. Under the new ''Clash'' rules, the programs tied on points, 11\u201311, and VT won the tiebreaker.}}  rules, is also led by UVA (3\u20132, as of 2020). Moreover, the Cavaliers [[#All-time and ACC series results|lead the rivalry series]] in the majority of sports.\n\nBoth athletics programs are members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. In sports that have divisional play, such as [[college baseball]] and [[college football]], they both compete in the Coastal division of the conference. Despite different or no conference affiliations from 1937 to 2004, Virginia and Virginia Tech always maintained athletic ties and were annual rivals in a great many sports.\n\n==All-time and ACC series results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left\"\n|-\n!

Former [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] quarterback and football analyst [[Kirk Herbstreit]] said in 2004 that he \"never realized how much those people hate each other.\" He went on to say \"when I was down in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], I said some nice things about [[Al Groh]] and it was like I had turned my back on them.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Tech-UVa relationship eye-opening for Herbstreit |newspaper= [[Roanoke Times]] |date= 2004-11-19 |url= http://www.roanoke.com/sports/notebookplus/wb/14125 |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, students from Virginia Tech put a [[tee shirt]] from their school on a statue of [[Thomas Jefferson]] located on [[The Lawn]], after Virginia Tech's football team won the yearly matchup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/16130903/virginia-tech-vandals-play-dress-up-with-tj|title=Virginia Tech Pranksters Play Dress-Up With Mr. Jefferson|website=www.nbc29.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Virginia Tech joins ACC===\nIn 2003, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] initially planned to add [[Boston College]], [[University of Miami|Miami]], and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] to the conference lineup. Talks with Syracuse stalled as [[Jim Boeheim]] vocalized his opposition to the move, and Duke, UNC, and Virginia consistently voted against adding the Orange. When it became obvious that Syracuse lacked the necessary seven votes, Virginia Tech emerged as a compromise candidate put forward to win over the decisive seventh vote from the University of Virginia that ACC officials needed to gain approval for their expansion plans.\n\nVirginia Governor [[Mark Warner]] earlier had suggested the NCAA intervene and mediate the expansion process, and when that failed added pressure to UVA President John Casteen to refrain from casting an affirmative vote for the conference's plan to expand without Virginia Tech.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/sports/colleges-obstacles-are-piling-up-in-acc-expansion-path.html Obstacles Piling Up in ACC Expansion Path], accessed March 6, 2016</ref> Warner feared that such a move would hurt Virginia Tech by leaving it in a diminished Big East.<ref>{{cite news |title= ACC to invite Virginia Tech |newspaper= The Washington Times |date= June 19, 2003 |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jun/19/20030619-010114-6618r/?page=all |accessdate= 2014-08-21 }}</ref> UVA President [[John T.

Miami and Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004, with Boston College joining in 2005.\n\nThe primary significance of this development to the rivalry was that the athletic teams from the two schools would now be mandated to play every year. For instance, the men's [[college soccer]] teams did not face each other in any of the four seasons between 2000 and 2003. They have since met every year after Virginia Tech became a conference member in 2004. Additionally, in some sports where there was already an agreement to play each other on an annual basis, the teams might now play more than once. For instance, the men's [[college basketball]] teams had played each other annually since the 1934\u201335 season but not faced each other twice in the same season since 1983\u201384. Starting with the 2004\u201305 season, the teams have played at least twice each year, and in 2005\u201306 the teams met for a ''third'' time in the [[ACC Tournament]].\n\n===Impact of the Virginia Tech massacre===\nIn addition to ending the original ''[[#Commonwealth Challenge and Clash|Commonwealth Challenge]]'', the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] had the effect of lessening of hostilities between the two universities during the aftermath. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' \"students in both camps are more apt to think of themselves as simply Virginians.\" UVa students were among the first to lend support to the Virginia Tech community in the wake of the shootings. Likewise, the connections between the two university's populations are often very close. Prior to the 2007 football contest in Charlottesville both college's bands participated in a joint performance.<ref>{{cite news |title= After Tragedy, Hokies and Cavs Take Field as Virginians All |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date= 2007-11-23 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301215.html?nav=hcmodule |accessdate= 2007-12-02 |first= Jonathan |last= Mummolo}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...there was the sense among Tech students that fans of U-Va. \u2013 an institution founded by none other than [[Thomas Jefferson]] \u2013 looked down their noses at the mountain-ensconced Hokies of Blacksburg.

Former [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] quarterback and football analyst [[Kirk Herbstreit]] said in 2004 that he \"never realized how much those people hate each other.\" He went on to say \"when I was down in [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], I said some nice things about [[Al Groh]] and it was like I had turned my back on them.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Tech-UVa relationship eye-opening for Herbstreit |newspaper= [[Roanoke Times]] |date= 2004-11-19 |url= http://www.roanoke.com/sports/notebookplus/wb/14125 |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, students from Virginia Tech put a [[tee shirt]] from their school on a statue of [[Thomas Jefferson]] located on [[The Lawn]], after Virginia Tech's football team won the yearly matchup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/16130903/virginia-tech-vandals-play-dress-up-with-tj|title=Virginia Tech Pranksters Play Dress-Up With Mr. Jefferson|website=www.nbc29.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Virginia Tech joins ACC===\nIn 2003, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] initially planned to add [[Boston College]], [[University of Miami|Miami]], and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] to the conference lineup. Talks with Syracuse stalled as [[Jim Boeheim]] vocalized his opposition to the move, and Duke, UNC, and Virginia consistently voted against adding the Orange. When it became obvious that Syracuse lacked the necessary seven votes, Virginia Tech emerged as a compromise candidate put forward to win over the decisive seventh vote from the University of Virginia that ACC officials needed to gain approval for their expansion plans.\n\nVirginia Governor [[Mark Warner]] earlier had suggested the NCAA intervene and mediate the expansion process, and when that failed added pressure to UVA President John Casteen to refrain from casting an affirmative vote for the conference's plan to expand without Virginia Tech.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/sports/colleges-obstacles-are-piling-up-in-acc-expansion-path.html Obstacles Piling Up in ACC Expansion Path], accessed March 6, 2016</ref> Warner feared that such a move would hurt Virginia Tech by leaving it in a diminished Big East.<ref>{{cite news |title= ACC to invite Virginia Tech |newspaper= The Washington Times |date= June 19, 2003 |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jun/19/20030619-010114-6618r/?page=all |accessdate= 2014-08-21 }}</ref> UVA President [[John T.

Miami and Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004, with Boston College joining in 2005.\n\nThe primary significance of this development to the rivalry was that the athletic teams from the two schools would now be mandated to play every year. For instance, the men's [[college soccer]] teams did not face each other in any of the four seasons between 2000 and 2003. They have since met every year after Virginia Tech became a conference member in 2004. Additionally, in some sports where there was already an agreement to play each other on an annual basis, the teams might now play more than once. For instance, the men's [[college basketball]] teams had played each other annually since the 1934\u201335 season but not faced each other twice in the same season since 1983\u201384. Starting with the 2004\u201305 season, the teams have played at least twice each year, and in 2005\u201306 the teams met for a ''third'' time in the [[ACC Tournament]].\n\n===Impact of the Virginia Tech massacre===\nIn addition to ending the original ''[[#Commonwealth Challenge and Clash|Commonwealth Challenge]]'', the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] had the effect of lessening of hostilities between the two universities during the aftermath. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' \"students in both camps are more apt to think of themselves as simply Virginians.\" UVa students were among the first to lend support to the Virginia Tech community in the wake of the shootings. Likewise, the connections between the two university's populations are often very close. Prior to the 2007 football contest in Charlottesville both college's bands participated in a joint performance.<ref>{{cite news |title= After Tragedy, Hokies and Cavs Take Field as Virginians All |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date= 2007-11-23 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301215.html?nav=hcmodule |accessdate= 2007-12-02 |first= Jonathan |last= Mummolo}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...there was the sense among Tech students that fans of U-Va. \u2013 an institution founded by none other than [[Thomas Jefferson]] \u2013 looked down their noses at the mountain-ensconced Hokies of Blacksburg.

It was stated that players did not formerly meet \"their fellow players during the summer time, but with this club now on a sound footing they will be able to meet each other and spend enjoyable evenings which should bring about a better feeling between the different teams\".<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League Meeting of Executive\n| page =6\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIX| issue=254\n| date = 1918-02-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19181024.2.72\n| accessdate = 2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Representative Match===\nAuckland played a representative match for the first time in a few seasons. They had taken a hiatus during the war years but they played a trial match between and A and B team before a match with Canterbury at the Auckland Domain. The match attracted an enormous crowd of 10,000 and Auckland won easily by 45 points to 9.\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nThe season began with 2 preliminary rounds before the competitions began proper on 18 May. Around 5,000 spectators attended the first round matches at [[Victoria Park, New Zealand|Victoria Park]] and Devonport Domain. [[North Shore Albions]] played the preliminary rounds, round 1, and defaulted their next two matches before withdrawing from the competition.\n\n===Teams===\nThe competition featured 6 teams.\n*[[City Rovers]] (red and black)\n*[[Grafton Athletic]] (black and white)\n*Maritime (white)\n*[[Newton Rangers]] (red and white)\n*[[North Shore Albions]] (green and white)\n*[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] (blue and black)\n\n===Final Standings===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|9||8||0||1||103||53||'''16'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|9||7||0||2||123||37||'''14'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|8||5||0||3||73||85||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Grafton Athletic]]\n|8||2||0||6||94||125||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Maritime\n|8||1||0||8||45||110||'''2'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions]]\n|3||0||0||3||2||30||'''0'''\n|-\n|}\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] and Maritime both had default wins over [[North Shore Albions]]. Newton had a default win over Maritime (R9). These results are included in the standings.\n\n===Preliminary Round 1===\nNorth Shore was struggling to field a team owing to the impact of the war on their playing numbers. They only managed 11 players for their match with Maritime who were also fielding a weakened forward pack.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score =

{"title_page": "George O'Kelly", "text_new": "'''George Alexandre O'Kelly''' (12 October 1831 \u2013 2 September 1914) was a Franco-Irish pianist and composer, who spent much of his career in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. A member of a family of musicians, he was the only one with several orchestral scores to his credit. Another notable work is an opera on an Irish theme, performed in Boulogne in 1878.\n\n==Life==\nGeorge O'Kelly was born as George Alexandre Kelly in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. Unusually, his first name was spelled in the English way (without an 's' at the end). His father was an Irish emigrant, the Dublin-born pianist Joseph Kelly (1804\u20131856); his brothers included the composer [[Joseph O'Kelly]] (1828\u20131885) and the music publisher [[Auguste O'Kelly]] (1829\u20131900). Around 1835, when he was still very young, the family moved to Paris where he grew up in the Faubourg Poissonni\u00e8re area of the [[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]]. Nothing is known of his musical education, but it can be presumed that he received early lessons from his father and later some more advanced training from others. His earliest public record is his membership in the 'Association des Artistes Musiciens', where he is listed in the annual membership lists for the years 1848\u201352. For the last three of these years he was listed as pianist employed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]] (1850\u20131) and its successor, the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] (1852).\n\nTogether with another brother, the business man Charles (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric) O'Kelly (1830\u20131897), he returned to Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1852 and established himself there as a piano teacher and composer/performer. An 1851 concert review mentioned his impending move to Boulogne: \"O'Kelly est une jeune pianiste qui est venu se fixer ici, et qui est arriv\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'une reputation qui la soir\u00e9e de lundi n'a fait que justifier\".<ref>''Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris'', 3 May 1851, p. 142.</ref> Frequently, George was involved in the activities of the local Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philharmonique.<ref>See https://dezede.org/dossiers/boulogne-sur-mer-1853-1870-societe-philharmonique/ resp. https://dezede.org/individus/okelly/.</ref> In 1853, he seems to have persuaded the local music shop of B. Filliette to publish his first two piano compositions. Other early scores were an Overture (1853) for orchestra, performed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philharmonique in April 1853,<ref>''L'Impartial'', 7 April 1853.</ref> and the opera ''Une Nuit au bal'', performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal in December 1853.<ref>''L'Impartial'', 29 December 1853.</ref>\n\nGeorge married a widow with two sons in January 1856 and had two sons of his own, born in 1858 and 1860. For many years, the family lived in the historic walled town centre of Boulogne, in Rue du Puits d'Amour (1861\u2013mid-1870s) and Rue de la Balance (until c.1881). In 1871, two works for piano and orchestra were performed in Boulogne, but his largest works were two scores, both performed in September 1878 on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone to the new deep-sea harbour of Boulogne. One was the one-act comic opera ''Le Lutin de Galway'' and the other the cantata ''Le Port en eau profonde'' for baritone, chorus and orchestra. Although both works were well received by the press they were not taken up again in the following years. Seeking more artistic success may therefore have been one of the reasons why he moved back to Paris around 1881.\n\nAlthough he had a number of performances of small-scale compositions in Paris, and although his brother Auguste published many of his songs and piano works, establishing himself in the highly competitive environment of Paris proved difficult. He ran a small ''Acad\u00e9mie Artistique'' in the Ternes area of the [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arrondissement]], and the dedications on his published works indicate that he had a number of wealthy pupils. Yet, step-by-step he moved out of the city, probably due to increasing rents. Having been widowed in 1884, he married again in the same year. His works of the 1890s were self-published, and in his last creative years (1903\u20139) his compositional activity focused on music for children that was published in magazines such as the ''Journal des demoiselles'' and for which he wrote both music and words. He spent his last years in the Paris suburb of [[Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine]], where he died in 1914.\n\n==Music==\nAs a composer, George O'Kelly always stood in the shadow of his brother [[Joseph O'Kelly|Joseph]], to the extent that some of his works were perceived as works by the latter. For instance, ''Le Lutin de Galway'' appears in some contemporary operatic catalogues as a work by Joseph O'Kelly. This work plays in 18th-century [[county Galway]] in Ireland, although the plot is not particularly Irish.<ref>See Klein (2014), p. 255\u2013263; see Bibliography.</ref> Unfortunately, the music has not survived, so it is not possible to say whether there were any Irish influences in the score. George was the only member of the O'Kelly family in France, who wrote orchestral music, but this music, too, does not seem to have survived.\n\nHis published music includes 26 works for piano (dating 1853 to 1909) and 24 songs (1874 to 1909). His early piano music is quite attractive, although it quite strictly follows established role models ([[sonata form]]). It is in a romantic language and includes polkas, mazurkas, waltzes and marches. His most ambitious piano work is the ''Marche fun\u00e8bre'' (1876), an extended work written in memory of his father.<ref>Klein (2014), p. 270\u2013273.</ref> He clearly developed stylistically: his ''Fol\u00e2tres gazelles'' op. 20 (published in 1904), for instance, sounds as if influenced by [[Scott Joplin]].\n\nAlthough he performed with singers from the early 1850s, George O'Kelly's songs constitute a considerably later part of his worklist, the earliest pieces appearing in 1874. He took a while to develop, his best vocal music can be found in ''Le Camo\u00ebns mourant'' (1880) and his 1890s settings of poems by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e]]. For ''Le Camo\u00ebns mourant'', a work commemorating the anniversary of the Portuguese poet [[Luis de Cam\u00f5es]], he was awarded the Brazilian national order of merit, the [[Order of the Rose]]. His last songs are attractive little miniatures that appeared in children's journals, often to his own words.\n\n==List of works==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Opera'''\n*''Une Nuit au bal'' (libretto by Antoine Obert), 1 act, performed Boulogne-sur-Mer, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal, 24 December 1853.\n*''Le Lutin de Galway'' (libretto by Ernest Deseille and Henri Bauhin), 1 act, performed Boulogne-sur-Mer, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal, 9 September 1878.\n\n'''Voice and orchestra'''\n*''\u00c0 l'oasis'' (\u00c9mile Lafarge) for baritone and orchestra (1854)\n*''Le Port en eau profonde'' for baritone, chorus and orchestra (1878)\n\n'''Orchestral'''\n*''Ouverture'' (1853)\n*''Fantaisie sur le Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs'' for piano and orchestra (1871)\n*''Marche triomphale'' for piano and orchestra (1871)\n\n'''Piano music'''\n*''Deux Pens\u00e9es caract\u00e9ristiques'': 1.

His earliest public record is his membership in the 'Association des Artistes Musiciens', where he is listed in the annual membership lists for the years 1848\u201352. For the last three of these years he was listed as pianist employed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]] (1850\u20131) and its successor, the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] (1852).\n\nTogether with another brother, the business man Charles (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric) O'Kelly (1830\u20131897), he returned to Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1852 and established himself there as a piano teacher and composer/performer. An 1851 concert review mentioned his impending move to Boulogne: \"O'Kelly est une jeune pianiste qui est venu se fixer ici, et qui est arriv\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'une reputation qui la soir\u00e9e de lundi n'a fait que justifier\".<ref>''Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris'', 3 May 1851, p. 142.</ref> Frequently, George was involved in the activities of the local Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philharmonique.<ref>See https://dezede.org/dossiers/boulogne-sur-mer-1853-1870-societe-philharmonique/ resp. https://dezede.org/individus/okelly/.</ref> In 1853, he seems to have persuaded the local music shop of B. Filliette to publish his first two piano compositions. Other early scores were an Overture (1853) for orchestra, performed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philharmonique in April 1853,<ref>''L'Impartial'', 7 April 1853.</ref> and the opera ''Une Nuit au bal'', performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal in December 1853.<ref>''L'Impartial'', 29 December 1853.</ref>\n\nGeorge married a widow with two sons in January 1856 and had two sons of his own, born in 1858 and 1860. For many years, the family lived in the historic walled town centre of Boulogne, in Rue du Puits d'Amour (1861\u2013mid-1870s) and Rue de la Balance (until c.1881). In 1871, two works for piano and orchestra were performed in Boulogne, but his largest works were two scores, both performed in September 1878 on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone to the new deep-sea harbour of Boulogne. One was the one-act comic opera ''Le Lutin de Galway'' and the other the cantata ''Le Port en eau profonde'' for baritone, chorus and orchestra. Although both works were well received by the press they were not taken up again in the following years. Seeking more artistic success may therefore have been one of the reasons why he moved back to Paris around 1881.\n\nAlthough he had a number of performances of small-scale compositions in Paris, and although his brother Auguste published many of his songs and piano works, establishing himself in the highly competitive environment of Paris proved difficult. He ran a small ''Acad\u00e9mie Artistique'' in the Ternes area of the [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arrondissement]], and the dedications on his published works indicate that he had a number of wealthy pupils. Yet, step-by-step he moved out of the city, probably due to increasing rents. Having been widowed in 1884, he married again in the same year. His works of the 1890s were self-published, and in his last creative years (1903\u20139) his compositional activity focused on music for children that was published in magazines such as the ''Journal des demoiselles'' and for which he wrote both music and words. He spent his last years in the Paris suburb of [[Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine]], where he died in 1914.\n\n==Music==\nAs a composer, George O'Kelly always stood in the shadow of his brother [[Joseph O'Kelly|Joseph]], to the extent that some of his works were perceived as works by the latter. For instance, ''Le Lutin de Galway'' appears in some contemporary operatic catalogues as a work by Joseph O'Kelly. This work plays in 18th-century [[county Galway]] in Ireland, although the plot is not particularly Irish.<ref>See Klein (2014), p. 255\u2013263; see Bibliography.</ref> Unfortunately, the music has not survived, so it is not possible to say whether there were any Irish influences in the score. George was the only member of the O'Kelly family in France, who wrote orchestral music, but this music, too, does not seem to have survived.\n\nHis published music includes 26 works for piano (dating 1853 to 1909) and 23 songs (1874 to 1909). His early piano music is quite attractive, although it quite strictly follows established role models ([[sonata form]]). It is in a romantic language and includes polkas, mazurkas, waltzes and marches. His most ambitious piano work is the ''Marche fun\u00e8bre'' (1876), an extended work written in memory of his father.<ref>Klein (2014), p. 270\u2013273.</ref> He clearly developed stylistically: his ''Fol\u00e2tres gazelles'' op. 20 (published in 1904), for instance, sounds as if influenced by [[Scott Joplin]].\n\nAlthough he performed with singers from the early 1850s, George O'Kelly's songs constitute a considerably later part of his worklist, the earliest pieces appearing in 1874. He took a while to develop, his best vocal music can be found in ''Le Camo\u00ebns mourant'' (1880) and his 1890s settings of poems by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e]]. For ''Le Camo\u00ebns mourant'', a work commemorating the anniversary of the Portuguese poet [[Luis de Cam\u00f5es]], he was awarded the Brazilian national order of merit, the [[Order of the Rose]].\n\n==List of works==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Opera'''\n*''Une Nuit au bal'' (libretto by Antoine Obert), 1 act, performed Boulogne-sur-Mer, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal, 24 December 1853.\n*''Le Lutin de Galway'' (libretto by Ernest Deseille and Henri Bauhin), 1 act, performed Boulogne-sur-Mer, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal, 9 September 1878.\n\n'''Voice and orchestra'''\n*''\u00c0 l'oasis'' (\u00c9mile Lafarge) for baritone and orchestra (1854)\n*''Le Port en eau profonde'' for baritone, chorus and orchestra (1878)\n\n'''Orchestral'''\n*''Ouverture'' (1853)\n*''Fantaisie sur le Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs'' for piano and orchestra (1871)\n*''Marche triomphale'' for piano and orchestra (1871)\n\n'''Piano music'''\n*''Deux Pens\u00e9es caract\u00e9ristiques'': 1.
