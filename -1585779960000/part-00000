{"title_page": "Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina", "text_new": "{{History of Bosnia}}\nWithin the boundaries of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], there have been many layers of prehistoric cultures whose creation and disappearance are linked to migrations of unidentified ethnic groups.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:Butmirska vaza.jpg|left|thumb|The vase from Butmir near Sarajevo, early Neolithic]]\n{{Main|Prehistory of Southeastern Europe}}\nThe [[Paleolithic]] in Bosnia is marked by the oldest Paleolithic monument in southeastern Europe, the engravings in [[Badanj Cave]] near [[Stolac]] in Herzegovina. A magnificent one is ''Horse attacked by arrows'', preserved in fragments and dated around 14-12000 BC.\n\nDuring the time when [[Neolithic]] cultures were appearing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there existed interesting mixtures of [[Mediterranean]] and [[Pannonian]] cultures.\nHerzegovina was under the influence of [[impresso]] [[Pottery|ceramics]] from the western Mediterranean, as seen in ''Green Cave'' near [[Mostar]], \u010cairi near [[Stolac]], [[Lisi\u010di\u0107i]] near [[Konjic]] and ''Pe\u0107 Mlini'' near [[Grude]]. People then lived in caves or simple settlements on hilltops.  \nOn the upper mainstream of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river and in northeast parts of Bosnia (''Obre I'' near [[Kakanj]]), people lived in wooden houses built by the river. In this culture we can see influences from [[Adriatic]] cultures in the south and the Star\u010devi\u0107 culture in the northeast. Original expressions of [[Kakanj culture]] are ceramic pots on four legs, called [[rhyton]]. We can also find them in the [[Danilo culture]] on the Croatian coast. Due to these objects, ''Kakanj culture'' is considered a part of the wide circle of Neolithic populations that followed a cult of life force (from northern Italy, Dalmatia and [[Epirus]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]). \nThe [[Butmir culture]] near [[Sarajevo]] is distinctive, with fine glazed ceramics and miscellaneous geometrical decorations (often spirals). Figures from Butmir are unique sculptures modeled with hand; heads are almost like portraits with emphasized parts of body.\n\n[[Bronze age]] settlements in Herzegovina were built like [[citadel]]s (natively called ''gradina''), and in Bosnia we have necropolises with stone [[tumuli]]. During this time, bronze arms, decorated plates, flat necklaces, and fibulas were decorated with a specific geometrical style of engraved ornament.\n\n==Illyrian period==\n{{See|Illyria}}\n[[File:Glasinac culture.png|thumb|right|200px|Iron Age Glasinac culture (around 300 BC).]]\nThe bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].\n\nFrom  8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was that of the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC.[7] The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom.[8] The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.[9] The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.[10] Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.\n\nFrom the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Halstat]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different.\nA very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high.\n''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).\n\n[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]\nIn the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\n\nIn the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]], the main center of ancient culture in B&H. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.\n\n==Roman period==\n{{See|Dalmatia (Roman province)}}\n{{See|Illyricum (Roman province)}}\nConflict between the Illyrians and [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] started in 229 BC. In the year 168 BC, the land of Illyrians became the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. Rome completed its annexation of the region in 9 A.D, ending a three-year rebellion of Illyrians against Romans. In the year 10 A.D., Illyria was divided and the northern strip of today's Bosnia along the south side of the [[Sava|Sava River]] became part of the new province of [[Pannonia]]. The rest of what is today [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Dalmatia]], and western [[Serbia]] became part of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]]. \n[[File:Ancient Bosnia.png|thumbnail|Map of ancient settlements and roads in Bosnia and Herzegovina|left]]\nIn the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from all over the [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region. Several towns of today's Bosnia were founded under Roman rule. For example, the town of [[Blagaj]] on the [[Buna River (Neretva)|Buna River]] is built on the site of the Roman town of [[Bona (Hum)|Bona]]. Roman Bosnia enjoyed a huge development, with many \"Roman via\" and \"castra\" and an economy based on the exploitation of mines.<ref>[http://av.zrc-sazu.si/pdf/56/AV_56_Skegro.pdf Map and information of Roman Bosnia-Herzegovina]</ref> Following Roman rule there was a large number of [[Vlachs]] who were descended from a pre-Slavic population.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

Artists trained in the tradition of the [[Mughal miniature]] were dispersed from the imperial Mughal court, and developed styles also drawing from local traditions of painting, especially those illustrating the Hindu religious epics, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''.  Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniatures]] in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of [[Shekhawati]], the forts and palaces built by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs.\n\nSubjects varied, but portraits of the ruling family, often engaged in hunting or their daily activities, were generally popular, as were narrative scenes from the epics or [[Hindu mythology]], as well as some [[genre painting|genre scenes]] of un-named people.\n \nThe colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones.  Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.\n\n== Content ==\nWhile there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.\n\nOutside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.\n\nBoth of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as precise likenesses in portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists ([[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works.

In the next century, most of the Bosnian province wasn't a borderland and developed in relative peace. It was administered by the Ottoman [[Bosnia Eyalet]] and [[Herzegovina Eyalet]].\n\nHowever, when the Empire lost the [[Great Turkish War|war of 1683\u20131697 with Austria]], and ceded Slavonia and Hungary to Austria at the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]], Bosnia's northern and western borders became the frontier between the Austrian and Ottoman empires.\n\nIn 1716, Austria occupied northern Bosnia and [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718-1739)|northern Serbia]], but this lasted only until 1739 when they were ceded to the Ottoman Empire at the [[Treaty of Belgrade]]. The borders set then remained in place for another century and a half, though the border wars continued.\n\nThe [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars between the Ottomans and Austria and Venice]] impoverished Bosnia, and encouraged further migration and resettlement; Muslim refugees from Hungary and Slavonia resettled in Bosnia, assimilating into the native [[Bosniak]] population, whilst many [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]], mostly from [[Kosovo]] but also including those from Serbia and Bosnia, resettled across the Bosnian border in [[Slavonia]] and the [[Military Frontier]] at the invitation of the Austrian Emperor.\n\nAccording to an Ottoman Muslim account of the [[Austro-Russian\u2013Turkish War (1735\u201339)]] translated into English by C.

Despite winning several notable victories, the rebels were eventually defeated in a battle near Sarajevo in 1832. Internal discord contributed to the failure of the rebellion, because Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 was not supported by much of the Herzegovinian nobility. The rebellion was extinguished by 1850, but the Empire continued to decline.\n\nThe Ottoman Sultans attempted to implement [[Ottoman Military Reform Efforts|various economic and military reforms]] in the early 19th century in order to address the grave issues mostly caused by the border wars. The reforms, however, were usually met with resistance by the military captaincies of Bosnia.\n\nThe Ottoman rule lasted for over four hundred years, until 1878, although nominally Bosnia-Herzegovina remained Ottoman territory (without actual effective rule) until 1908 when it officially became part of Austria-Hungary.\n\n==Governing structure==\n\nThe Ottoman rule also saw many architectural investments in Bosnia and the creation and development of many new cities including [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]]. This is mostly because of the high esteem the Bosniaks held in the eyes of the Sultans and the Turks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Empire also promoted close relations between Turks and Bosniaks, and many Turks during Ottoman times felt a trust for and a kinship with the Bosniaks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Administrative===\n{{See also|State organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\nThe area of the current Bosnia and Herzegovina was initially part of the Ottoman [[Rumelia Province, Ottoman Empire|Rumelia Province]] ([[Beylerbeylik (Ottoman Empire)|beylerbeylik]]) and was divided between the three [[sanjak]]s (second-level administrative units) of Bosnia (Bosna), Herzegovina (Hersek), and Zvornik (\u0130zvornik).  In 1580, the Ottomans created the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] which was subdivided into the sanjaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others. They also introduced the so-called [[spahi]] system (actually the [[Timariots|timar holder system]]) which changed the local administration and the [[agriculture]], but was generally an arrangement similar to European [[feudal]] [[fief]]s.\n\nLater as part of the Ottoman [[Tanzimat]] reforms, the region became the [[Bosnia Vilayet]] and [[Herzegovina Vilayet]] which together encompassed present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina along with the [[Sand\u017eak]] region (then the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]).\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Millet (Ottoman Empire)}}\nAll of the [[Bosnian Church|Bosnian Church adherents]] eventually converted to [[Islam]]. There are conflicting claims on the exact ratios or whether or how much of it was voluntary or not. Since earliest Turkish [[defter]]s clearly distinguish Bosnian Christians from Catholics or Orthodox, it is now general consensus that the number of Christians adherents in the times during Ottoman rule did not exceed a few hundred people, due to mainly Islamic converts.\n\nOttoman rule also changed the ethnic and religious makeup of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many Catholic Bosnians retreated to Croatia, which was controlled by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]] after the Ottoman conquest of most of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and to [[Dalmatia]], which was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] after the fall of Hungary. Conversely, during the couple of centuries Croatia was under Austro-Hungarian rule and Bosnia under Ottoman rule, Muslims from the north and west migrated into Bosnia, forming a heavily-Muslim pocket in its northwest corner around [[Biha\u0107]]. Other unconverted Bosniak Catholics started to identify themselves as [[Bosnian Croats]], although this process was not complete until the 20th century (the 19th century Catholic writer [[Ivan Franjo Juki\u0107]], for example, considered himself Bosniak and not Croat). Orthodox [[Serbs]] and [[Vlachs]] from Herzegovina and the neighboring [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (Belgrade Pashaluk) migrated into parts of Bosnia. Many [[Vlachs]] later assimilated into the local Serb, [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], and [[Croat]] populations. The Ottoman period also saw the development of a [[Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] community in Bosnia, chiefly in Sarajevo. The [[Sephardic Jews]] were persecuted in and expelled from [[Catholic]] [[Spain]] at the end of the 15th century, and many resettled in the Ottoman Empire because of its tolerance towards other religions (especially towards [[People of the Book]]), mainly in and around [[Istanbul]]. The first [[synagogue]] was built in [[Sarajevo]] in 1581.\n\n===Taxation===\nDuring the Ottoman period, [[Christians]] were treated as \"[[dhimmi]]s\" by the Ottoman authorities but were otherwise subject to the same restrictions as [[Muslim]] subjects. Dhimmis were not required to join the army, but they paid a special tax called ''[[jizya]]'' (''glavarina'' in Bosnia).\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, many children of Christian parents, regardless of whether Orthodox or Catholic, were separated from their families and raised to be members of the [[Janissary]] Corps (this practice was known as the [[devsirme|dev\u015firme]] system, 'dev\u015firmek' meaning 'to gather' or 'to recruit'). However, this practice was heavily resented by most of the people of the area. This was because of the very high position a Janissary held in Ottoman society. Owing to their education (for they were taught arts, science, maths, poetry, literature and many of the languages spoken in the Ottoman Empire, such as [[Arabic]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), Janissaries could easily work their way up to a becoming governors or even [[Grand Vizier]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Portal|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n==Literature==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Batakovi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an T.|title=The Serbs of Bosnia & Herzegovina: History and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3xpAAAAMAAJ|date=1996|publisher=Dialogue Association}}\n* Markus Koller and Kemal H.

Despite winning several notable victories, the rebels were eventually defeated in a battle near Sarajevo in 1832. Internal discord contributed to the failure of the rebellion, because Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 was not supported by much of the Herzegovinian nobility. The rebellion was extinguished by 1850, but the Empire continued to decline.\n\nThe Ottoman Sultans attempted to implement [[Ottoman Military Reform Efforts|various economic and military reforms]] in the early 19th century in order to address the grave issues mostly caused by the border wars. The reforms, however, were usually met with resistance by the military captaincies of Bosnia.\n\nThe Ottoman rule lasted for over four hundred years, until 1878, although nominally Bosnia-Herzegovina remained Ottoman territory (without actual effective rule) until 1908 when it officially became part of Austria-Hungary.\n\n==Governing structure==\n\nThe Ottoman rule also saw many architectural investments in Bosnia and the creation and development of many new cities including [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]]. This is mostly because of the high esteem the Bosniaks held in the eyes of the Sultans and the Turks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Empire also promoted close relations between Turks and Bosniaks, and many Turks during Ottoman times felt a trust for and a kinship with the Bosniaks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Administrative===\n{{See also|State organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\nThe area of the current Bosnia and Herzegovina was initially part of the Ottoman [[Rumelia Province, Ottoman Empire|Rumelia Province]] ([[Beylerbeylik (Ottoman Empire)|beylerbeylik]]) and was divided between the three [[sanjak]]s (second-level administrative units) of Bosnia (Bosna), Herzegovina (Hersek), and Zvornik (\u0130zvornik).  In 1580, the Ottomans created the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] which was subdivided into the sanjaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others. They also introduced the so-called [[spahi]] system (actually the [[Timariots|timar holder system]]) which changed the local administration and the [[agriculture]], but was generally an arrangement similar to European [[feudal]] [[fief]]s.\n\nLater as part of the Ottoman [[Tanzimat]] reforms, the region became the [[Bosnia Vilayet]] and [[Herzegovina Vilayet]] which together encompassed present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina along with the [[Sand\u017eak]] region (then the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]).\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Millet (Ottoman Empire)}}\nAll of the [[Bosnian Church|Bosnian Church adherents]] eventually converted to [[Islam]]. There are conflicting claims on the exact ratios or whether or how much of it was voluntary or not. Since earliest Turkish [[defter]]s clearly distinguish Bosnian Christians from Catholics or Orthodox, it is now general consensus that the number of Christians adherents in the times during Ottoman rule did not exceed a few hundred people, due to mainly Islamic converts.\n\nOttoman rule also changed the ethnic and religious makeup of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many Catholic Bosnians retreated to Croatia, which was controlled by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]] after the Ottoman conquest of most of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and to [[Dalmatia]], which was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] after the fall of Hungary. Conversely, during the couple of centuries Croatia was under Austro-Hungarian rule and Bosnia under Ottoman rule, Muslims from the north and west migrated into Bosnia, forming a heavily-Muslim pocket in its northwest corner around [[Biha\u0107]]. Other unconverted Bosniak Catholics started to identify themselves as [[Bosnian Croats]], although this process was not complete until the 20th century (the 19th century Catholic writer [[Ivan Franjo Juki\u0107]], for example, considered himself Bosniak and not Croat). Orthodox [[Serbs]] and [[Vlachs]] from Herzegovina and the neighboring [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (Belgrade Pashaluk) migrated into parts of Bosnia. Many [[Vlachs]] later assimilated into the local Serb, [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], and [[Croat]] populations. The Ottoman period also saw the development of a [[Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] community in Bosnia, chiefly in Sarajevo. The [[Sephardic Jews]] were persecuted in and expelled from [[Catholic]] [[Spain]] at the end of the 15th century, and many resettled in the Ottoman Empire because of its tolerance towards other religions (especially towards [[People of the Book]]), mainly in and around [[Istanbul]]. The first [[synagogue]] was built in [[Sarajevo]] in 1581.\n\n===Taxation===\nDuring the Ottoman period, [[Christians]] were treated as \"[[dhimmi]]s\" by the Ottoman authorities but were otherwise subject to the same restrictions as [[Muslim]] subjects. Dhimmis were not required to join the army, but they paid a special tax called ''[[jizya]]'' (''glavarina'' in Bosnia).\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, many children of Christian parents, regardless of whether Orthodox or Catholic, were separated from their families and raised to be members of the [[Janissary]] Corps (this practice was known as the [[devsirme|dev\u015firme]] system, 'dev\u015firmek' meaning 'to gather' or 'to recruit'). However, this practice was heavily resented by most of the people of the area. This was because of the very high position a Janissary held in Ottoman society. Owing to their education (for they were taught arts, science, maths, poetry, literature and many of the languages spoken in the Ottoman Empire, such as [[Arabic]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), Janissaries could easily work their way up to a becoming governors or even [[Grand Vizier]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Portal|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n==Literature==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Batakovi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an T.|title=The Serbs of Bosnia & Herzegovina: History and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3xpAAAAMAAJ|date=1996|publisher=Dialogue Association}}\n* Markus Koller and Kemal H.

The new city soon took over the functions of old Plze\u0148 and became known as ''Nov\u00e1 Plze\u0148'' (New Plze\u0148), later simply as ''Plze\u0148'', while the older settlement on the [[\u00daslava]] river was called ''Star\u00e1 Plze\u0148'' (Old Plze\u0148) and since then, in a more recent variant, ''Star\u00fd Plzenec''.\n\n==Sights==\n[[Radyn\u011b Castle]] (the ruin of a medieval castle from the 14th century open to the public) is on [[Radyn\u011b Hill]] above the town (to the south).\nOn [[H\u016frka Hill]] above the town (to the north) there is the [[St Peter and Paul Rotunda]], a Romanesque church from the late 10th century and the foundations of other buildings of the old stronghold.\n\n[[Image:Stary Plzenec CZ Masaryk Square pano from S 0605.jpg|thumb|none|350px|Masaryk Square with church of St John The Baptist (left) and Town Hall (right).]]\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Filip J\u00edcha]] (born 1982), handballer\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Plze\u0148-City District}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stary Plzenec}}\n[[Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Plze\u0148-South District]]\n\n\n{{Plze\u0148-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%C3%BD_Plzenec"}
