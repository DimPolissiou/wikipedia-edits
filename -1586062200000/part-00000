One of his ancestors was Confederate general [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. His father was severely injured as a [[United States Army Air Service]] [[Aviator|pilot]] in [[World War I]], and his brother Robert fought in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in [[World War II]] and survived capture by the Germans.\n\nForrest left Mexia when he was a young boy. The [[oil business]] led his father to move the family to [[Houston, Texas]]; [[Saginaw, Michigan]]; and [[Olney, Illinois]]. At Olney High School, he was a scholar and an athlete, joining the [[National Honor Society]] and playing [[varsity team|varsity]] [[basketball]] and [[American football|football]]. A swimmer, he worked summers as a [[lifeguard]]. Forrest was president of his senior class and the debate club, and voted \"most popular.\"\n\n==Military career==\n===Early career and Korea===\nForrest entered the[[ United States Military Academy]] in 1945 during the closing days of World War II. As a West Point cadet, he played B-Squad football and fought on the A-1 boxing team. His roommates were [[Samuel S. Coursen]], Joe Toomey, Murray Williams, Collier Ross, and Jim Scholtz. In his Third Class year, at the \"Hop\" dance party, Forrest met Patricia Smith of [[Long Beach, New York]], whom he married in July 1949 after graduation. Forrest proceeded to [[Fort Riley]], Kansas and [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he attended the [[Infantry Basic Course]] before being sent to the [[Korean War]].\n\nForrest led a [[platoon]] of the 2nd Battalion, [[5th Cavalry Regiment]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] through the darkest days in Korea. After fighting in the [[Battle of the Pusan Perimeter]], his command was the first to enter North Korea and the North Korean capital [[Pyongyang]]. He earned the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]], two [[Purple Heart]]s, and two [[Silver Star]]s. Two of his West Point roommates, Lieutenant [[Samuel S. Coursen]], a fellow 5th Cavalry Regiment company commander and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, and Lieutenant Joe Toomey, were killed in action in Korea.\n\nFrom Forrest's Silver Star citations: \"Courageously gathering his six remaining men, he briefed them on his plan of surprise action to rout the enemy group... he led them yelling and shouting into the enemy's midst. This ruse... completely baffled and surprised the enemy into believing their main position had fallen...\" Although wounded in the leg during the early part of the action, Lieutenant Forrest refused to be evacuated and moved from position to position, in the face of heavy enemy fire, to encourage and reorganize his men. He directed a defense of his position and led a successful counterattack.\n\n===Rise to senior command===\nUpon his return from Korea, Forrest was posted to [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]] in 1951 as a company commander with the 8th Infantry Division and the 28th Infantry Division in Germany, [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]] and the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], where he earned a master's degree in [[journalism]]. He completed the [[Infantry Advanced Course]], [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]], [[Airborne forces|Airborne]] and other schools, was assigned to [[the Pentagon]], and graduated from the [[United States Army War College]].\n\nIn 1967 Forrest took command of the 3rd Battalion, [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[101st Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Campbell]], Kentucky. His unit was mobilized to maintain order during the August 1967 riots in Detroit, Michigan. He later took the battalion to Vietnam, where in two tours of duty he earned a second Combat Infantryman Badge; and awarded a third Silver Star, the [[Legion of Merit]], four [[Bronze Star Medal]]s for Valor, and four [[Air Medal]]s for Valor. After the [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968, General [[William Westmoreland]] awarded Forrest's unit the [[Valorous Unit Award]] and [[Meritorious Unit Citation]].\n\nAfter his Vietnam tours of duty in 1971, Forrest was assigned to the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]], [[Fort Hood]], [[Texas]] as commander of 1st Brigade and Support Command, then chief of staff. From 1976 to 1978 he was commanding general of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Carson]], [[Colorado]]. In 1979 he took command of [[First United States Army]] at [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]] and led the military's response and logistical support during the 1980 Cuban refugee crisis. His final assignment in July 1981 was as Deputy Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Army Europe]] at  [[Heidelberg]], Germany, where he retired after 33 years of active duty on August 11, 1983.\n\n==Post-army career and retirement==\nIn retirement, Forrest moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], and plunged into civic affairs, winning election to the city council. As the first executive director of the [[United States Space Foundation]], Forrest was a proponent of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]] [[space defense initiative]] of the [[Reagan Administration]]. He died May 27, 1997 at age 69, following a series of strokes. In 1998, the Forrest Fitness Center at Fort Carson was dedicated and named in his honor. Forrest was buried at [[Evergreen Cemetery (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Colorado Springs.\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{|\n|[[File:CIB2.png|135px]] [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] (two awards)\n|-\n|[[File:Ranger Tab.svg|80px]] [[Ranger tab]]\n|-\n|[[File:USAFSeniorParatrooper.jpg|90px]] [[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Senior Parachutist Badge]]\n|-\n|[[File:United States Army Staff Identification Badge.png|80px]]&nbsp;[[Army Staff Identification Badge]]\n|}\n{|\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Army Distinguished Service Medal]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=oak|ribbon=Silver Star ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Silver Star]] with two bronze [[oak leaf cluster]]s\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Legion of Merit]] with oak leaf cluster\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=3|type=oak|other_device=v|ribbon=Bronze Star ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[\"V\" device]] and three oak leaf clusters\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Air Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}<span style=\"position:relative; top: 0px; left: -29px; display: inline-block; width: 0;\">[[File:Award numeral 4.png|12px]]</span><span style=\"position:relative; top: 0px; left: -43px; display: inline-block; width: 0;\">[[File:\"V\" device, brass.svg|13px]]</span>\n|[[Air Medal]] with V device and bronze [[award numeral]] 4\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|ribbon=Army Commendation Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Army Commendation Medal]] with oak leaf cluster\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|ribbon=Purple Heart ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Purple Heart]] with oak leaf cluster\n|-\n|[[File:Valorous Unit Award ribbon.svg|60px]]\n|[[Valorous Unit Award]]\n|-\n|[[File:Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon.svg|60px]]\n|[[Meritorious Unit Commendation]]\n|-\n|[[File:World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|60px]]\n|[[World War II Victory Medal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Army of Occupation ribbon.svg|60px]]\n|[[Army of Occupation Medal]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[National Defense Service Medal]] with oak leaf cluster\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=Korean Service Medal - Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Korean Service Medal]] with one bronze [[service star]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=Vietnam Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Vietnam Service Medal]] with service star\n|-\n|[[File:Korean Presidential Unit Citation.png|60px]]\n|[[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]]\n|-\n|[[File:United Nations Service Medal Korea ribbon.svg|60px]]\n|[[United Nations Korea Medal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Vietnam Campaign Medal ribbon with 60- clasp.svg|60px]]\n|[[Vietnam Campaign Medal]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book  |last =Ray  |first =Max  |authorlink =  |coauthors =  |title =The History of the First United States Army From 1918 to 1980  |publisher =First United States Army  |year=1980  |location =Fort Meade MD  |pages =134, 137 |url =  |doi =  |id =    |isbn =}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.west-point.org/users/usma1949/17127/\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222010722/http://www.history.army.mil/matrix/4ID/4ID-Cdrs.htm 4th Infantry Division Commanders]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080510093825/http://www.history.hqusareur.army.mil/USAREURDeputyCommanders.htm US Army Europe Deputy Commanders]\n*[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968194-2,00.html \"Roger, Houston . . .

{"title_page": "Ve Skerries", "text_new": "[[File:Papa Stour Shtl.png|right|thumb|270px|Map of the Ve Skerries]]\nThe '''Ve Skerries''' or '''Vee Skerries'''{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}} ({{lang-non|Vestan sker}}, West Skerries) are a group of low [[Skerry|skerries]] {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} north west of [[Papa Stour]], on the west coast of [[Shetland]], Scotland. They define the southwest perimeter of [[St Magnus Bay]].{{sfn|OS Name Book|1878|p=3}}\n\n==Skerries==\nThe individual skerries are named:\n\n* North Skerry\n* Ormal ({{Lang-nrn|ormel}} - remnant or fragment){{sfn|Jakobsen|1928|p=640}}\n* The Clubb ([[Shetland dialect]]: hill square in shape,{{sf|Jakobsen|1897|p=78}} from {{Lang-nrn|klobb}} - crag or rugged hill-top){{sfn|Jakobsen|1928|p=433}}\n* Reaverack\n* Helligoblo\n\n==Wrecks==\n===''Ben Doran''===\nOn 29 March 1930, the [[Aberdeen]] [[Steamship|steam]] [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] ''Ben Doran'' ran aground on the Ve Skerries in bad weather and rough sea conditions, due in part to poor coverage in nautical charts of the area, and lack of knowledge of the tides around the shallow reef surrounding the Ve Skerries which were considered unpredictable even to experienced Shetland fishermen. Another passing trawler brought news of the accident to [[Lerwick]] by 5pm,{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}} after which the [[Stromness]] Lifeboat Station in [[Orkney]] was notified, and [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade's]] life-saving apparatus - a rocket propelled rope to shoot to another vessel, to allow for it to be towed to safety{{sfn|SSVLB|}} - was arranged and taken by lorry to [[Ronas Voe]]. The apparatus was taken aboard the steam trawler ''Arora'' and it departed towards the Ve Skerries at 2am on 30 March.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}}\n\nHonorary Secretary of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Lerwick branch, George Theodore Kay,{{sfn|Gott|2008}} who was aware of the geography of the Ve Skerries, thought that a ship the size of ''Arora'' would struggle to come close enough to ''Ben Doran'' to effect a rescue attempt. He learned that a smaller motor boat named ''Smiling Morn'' was berthed in [[Voe, Delting]], and suggested that this vessel accompanied by a four-oared rowing boat would have a better chance at success. He, with John Falconer, master of the trawler ''Boscobell'', and W. H. Dougall from [[The Mission to Seafarers|The Missions to Seamen]] proceeded to Voe and enrolled the assistance of ''Smiling Morn''.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66-67}} They headed for Housa Voe, [[Papa Stour]] to procure the expertise of someone there with experience of the seabed around the Ve Skerries. By entering Housa Voe in rough conditions and during the night, they themselves nearly collided with a sunken rock. Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" (Shetland dialect: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the Ve Skerries, only the gallows for supporting the ship's anchor could be seen.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=69}} All of the approximately nine crew members were killed.{{sfn|Allen|2018}}\n\nThe wrecking of ''Ben Doran'' and the deaths of the crew validated the need for a lifeboat to be stationed in Shetland. In 1933 the [[Aith]] Lifeboat Station was opened.{{sfn|RNLI|}}\n\n===''Elinor Viking''===\nOn the 9th December 1977 ''Elinor Viking'', an Aberdeen trawler was wrecked on the Ve Skerries due to extreme weather conditions. The Aith Lifeboat was sent to the scene, however due to the wreck's position it was not able to get close enough to the vessel to transfer to the crew to safety. Both of the ship's liferafts had been swept away by the sea, and the ship had been breached and lay half-filled with water. An appeal was made to [[Sumburgh Airport]] where [[British Airways]] had helicopters stationed, and a volunteer crew was assembled. They reached the scene and, despite the crew of the helicopter not being trained for rescue work, all 8 of ''Elinor Viking's'' crew were winched to safety.{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}}\n\n===''Coelleira''===\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries pre salvage attempt.jpg|thumb|Coelleira aground on the Clubb before the salvage attempt]]\nLate on 3 August 2019, the UK-registered, Spanish-owned fishing vessel ''Coelleira'' was returning to [[Scrabster]] from about {{Convert|18|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} north of [[Yell Sound]]'s entrance{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} with a catch of approximately 15 tonnes of fish.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}} Apart from the low light, the conditions were ideal - there was clear visibility, smooth seas and light winds. With the intention of returning as quickly as possible (due to unexpected delays in their fishing operations), the ship's mate set the vessel on a heading of 184\u00b0 and proceeded at a speed of {{convert|9|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} to keep close to the coast in order to save time. At 21:42 the heading was set to 204\u00b0.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 22:30 the skipper (a 56-year-old Spanish national){{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=7}} took over watch from the mate, who went to bed. The skipper over the next 2 hours made five adjustments to the ships' heading in order to follow the coast. The skipper during this time worked on fish landing records and other managerial work. It is not known how often the vessel's position was checked.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 00:23 on 4 August, vessel was set to heading of 206\u00b0 with the aim of keeping around {{Convert|3.5|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} away from any navigational risk. The skipper did not see any hazards on the [[chartplotter]], and while he did see a [[lighthouse]] light towards the port bow, he assumed it was a lighthouse on the mainland.{{sfn|MAIB|2020}}\n\nAt an unspecified time, the skipper left the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], and (according to a [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] report) while the skipper was returning to his post at 01:24, ''Coelleira'' ran aground on the Clubb travelling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}}. The crew awoke with the sound of the collision, whereupon they assembled in the wheelhouse and donned [[Survival suit|survival suits]] and [[life jackets]]. Two lifeboats were launched off the starboard side.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} At 01:29 the Shetland [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] were notified of the accident, and in response the [[Aith]] lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were sent to the scene. All 15{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=12}} crew were winched aboard the helicopter, and were returned to [[Lerwick]] uninjured.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries post salvage attempt.jpg|left|thumb|''Coelleira'' on its port side after the salvage attempt]]\nAttempts were subsequently made to refloat the vessel. The ship was surveyed with assistance from the [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] tug ''Tystie'', however during the inspection the vessel rolled 5-10\u00b0 to port, at which point the men aboard were evacuated.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4-5}} The emergency towing vessel ''Ievoli Black'' attempted to pull ''Coelleira'' off the Clubb on 7 August, however during the attempt the ship tilted over 55\u00b0 to port, and with a forecast of poor sea conditions and weather the ship was deemed unsalvageable. In the following days the ship broke up and sank.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=5}}\n\nIn its report on the incident, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] concluded that the planning of the passage between the fishing grounds and Scrabster was inadequate, the ship's position was not kept track of, and bridge was empty when the ship went aground. They posed that the skipper's decision making may have been impacted by fatigue, while the set up of the bridge's controls may have made it more difficult to observe risks to the ship.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=1}}\n\n== Ve Skerries Lighthouse ==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q33061460\n| name = Ve Skerries lighthouse\n| image = \n| image_name = \n| caption = \n| location = Ve Skerries<br> [[Papa Stour]]<br> [[Shetland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland Shetland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Shetland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|60.373129|-1.812250|display=inline,title}}\n| yearbuilt = 1979\n| yearlit = \n| automated = 1979\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = concrete tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with double balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower and lantern\n| height = {{convert|14.6|m|ft|0}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|17|m|ft|0}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens = \n| lightsource = batteries power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|11|mi|km|0}}\n| characteristic = Fl (2) W20s.\n| fogsignal = \n| admiralty = A3847\n| NGA = 3556\n| ARLHS = SCO-253\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board{{sfn|Rowlett|}}\n{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n}}\n\nThis modern lighthouse on the west side of Ormal was erected following the loss of ''Elinor Viking''. It replaced a lighted buoy itself put in place after the loss of ''Ben Doran.''{{sfn|Canmore|}} The tower is anchored to the rock with 18 steel bars. Built by engineer R. J. MacKay, it was first lit on 27 September 1979. It is not open to the public; its exposed location makes landings by sea difficult.{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n\n== Folklore ==\nDuring his tour of Shetland, [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] reported that the Ve Skerries were recounted by Shetlanders as being a retreat of the \"[[Haaf-fish]]\" (more commonly known as selkies) - creatures that would take the appearance of seal, but could take off their skins and would appear human, allowing them to fraternise on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=567}} Because [[Seal hunting|seal clubbing]] was (in the past) practised, and because seals would tend to lie on the Ve Skerries, the islanders of [[Papa Stour]] would go there to hunt the seals for the purpose of retrieving their skins, and according to these tales, would sometimes end up hunting the selkies.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=596-567}}\n\nOne such tale attested that a seal hunter in a party of several, after killing and skinning several seals, was caught out by a sudden swell which caused the rest of the group to assemble in their boat, but left him stranded. Despite trying to rescue him, he had to be abandoned due to the worsening weather. Several selkies (in the form of seals) then landed on the Ve Skerries, took off their skins and proceeded to rescue those of their kind who had been clubbed, stunned and skinned by the hunters. Those who had been skinned began to regain consciousness, and expressed their sorrow over the loss of their only way to return home{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=568}} (each selkie only possessing a single skin).{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=566}} In particular, one selkie named Ollavitinus would not be able to return to his wives and would be imprisoned on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=568-569}} When the stranded hunter was spotted, Ollavitinus' mother Gioga offered to transport him back to Papa Stour as long as he would return her son's skin, which the hunter agreed to. With the weather worsening, the hunter feared he would not be able to hold on to the seal skin of Gioga all the way back, and pleaded to be allowed to cut holes in her skin to which he could hold, to which Gioga complied. The hunter was successfully transported to Akers Geo, Papa Stour, after which he dutifully retrieved Ollavitinus' skin from a skeo in Hamna Voe, allowing him to return to the sea and his wives.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=569}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n\n* [[Out Skerries]]\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?211405|title=FV Ben Doran (A178) (+1930)|last=Tony|first=Allen|date=2018-05-06|website=The Wrecksite|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite Bayanne|access-date=2020-03-05|id=I108505|individual-first=George Theodore|individual-last=Kay|date=2008-03-02|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2542|title=Tide-lumps|last=Graham|first=John|date=|website=Shetland ForWirds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Samuel|url=https://archive.org/details/adescriptionshe00hibbgoog|title=A Description of the Shetland Islands, Comprising an Account of their Geology, Scenery, Antiquities, and Superstitions|publisher=Archibald Constable and Co|year=1822|isbn=|edition=1st|location=Edinburgh|pages=|ref=harv|author-link=Samuel Hibbert-Ware|via=archive.org}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|url=https://archive.org/details/anetymodictofthenornlanginshet/|title=An etymological dictionary of the Norn language in Shetland|publisher=David Nutt (A.

Another passing trawler brought news of the accident to [[Lerwick]] by 5pm,{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}} after which the [[Stromness]] Lifeboat Station in [[Orkney]] was notified, and [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade's]] life-saving apparatus - a rocket propelled rope to shoot to another vessel, to allow for it to be towed to safety{{sfn|SSVLB|}} - was arranged and taken by lorry to [[Ronas Voe]]. The apparatus was taken aboard the steam trawler ''Arora'' and it departed towards the Ve Skerries at 2am on 30 March.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66}}\n\nHonorary Secretary of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s Lerwick branch, George Theodore Kay,{{sfn|Gott|2008}} who was aware of the geography of the Ve Skerries, thought that a ship the size of ''Arora'' would struggle to come close enough to ''Ben Doran'' to effect a rescue attempt. He learned that a smaller motor boat named ''Smiling Morn'' was berthed in [[Voe, Delting]], and suggested that this vessel accompanied by a four-oared rowing boat would have a better chance at success. He, with John Falconer, master of the trawler ''Boscobell'', and W. H. Dougall from [[The Mission to Seafarers|The Missions to Seamen]] proceeded to Voe and enrolled the assistance of ''Smiling Morn''.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=66-67}} They headed for Housa Voe, [[Papa Stour]] to procure the expertise of someone there with experience of the seabed around the Ve Skerries. By entering Housa Voe in rough conditions and during the night, they themselves nearly collided with a sunken rock. Upon landfall in Housa Voe they enlisted the assistance of John Henderson, and headed towards the Ve Skerries.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\n''Smiling Morn'' arrived before 5am at the Ve Skerries, which ''Arora'' had reached first. Heavy seas and high winds continued and proved to make a very difficult rescue attempt. Five of ''Ben Doran'''s crew were seen clinging to the ship's [[rigging]] while [[sea spray]] hit them. ''Arora'' made an approach, however they only reached in far enough that their crew thought that they would not be able to return to safety, and still ''Ben Doran'' was out of reach. Retreating, they relayed that an additional two crewmembers were spotted in the rigging. ''Ben Doran''<nowiki/>'s position in the middle of the skerries (being {{convert|600|yd|m}} west from the nearest skerry) meant there was no plausible means of rescue, owing to the shallow reef surrounding it. Kay, who examined the area 2 months later, commented that it was \"abundantly clear that rescue would have been hopeless.\"{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nAt one point a \"tide lump\" (Shetland dialect: a rapid escalation of tidal activity){{sfn|Graham|}} fell into the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} rowing boat which ''Smiling Morn'' had in tow, and it sunk. ''Smiling Morn''{{'}}s skipper, John Jamieson, was adamant in attempting a rescue despite the danger to his own crew, and due to this a fight nearly broke out upon the ship, leading the rest of the crew to tie him up to keep him from doing so. Despite the effort put in by the crew of each of the would-be rescue vessels, they resolved that nothing more could be done and so they abandoned the rescue.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=67}}\n\nThe Stromness Lifeboat Station was alerted to the unsuccessful attempt by 4pm 30 March. By 4:45pm the Stromness Lifeboat departed, reaching Scalloway by 7:30am on 31 March. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the Ve Skerries, only the gallows for supporting the ship's anchor could be seen.{{sfn|The Lifeboat|1930|p=69}} All of the approximately nine crew members were killed.{{sfn|Allen|2018}}\n\nThe wrecking of ''Ben Doran'' and the deaths of the crew validated the need for a lifeboat to be stationed in Shetland. In 1933 the [[Aith]] Lifeboat Station was opened.{{sfn|RNLI|}}\n\n===''Elinor Viking''===\nOn the 9th December 1977 ''Elinor Viking'', an Aberdeen trawler was wrecked on the Ve Skerries due to extreme weather conditions. The Aith Lifeboat was sent to the scene, however due to the wreck's position it was not able to get close enough to the vessel to transfer to the crew to safety. Both of the ship's liferafts had been swept away by the sea, and the ship had been breached and lay half-filled with water. An appeal was made to [[Sumburgh Airport]] where [[British Airways]] had helicopters stationed, and a volunteer crew was assembled. They reached the scene and, despite the crew of the helicopter not being trained for rescue work, all 8 of ''Elinor Viking's'' crew were winched to safety.{{sfn|Reardon Smith|1978}}\n\n===''Coelleira''===\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries pre salvage attempt.jpg|thumb|Coelleira aground on the Clubb before the salvage attempt]]\nLate on 3 August 2019, the UK-registered, Spanish-owned fishing vessel ''Coelleira'' was returning to [[Scrabster]] from about {{Convert|18|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} north of [[Yell Sound]]'s entrance{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} with a catch of approximately 15 tonnes of fish.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}} Apart from the low light, the conditions were ideal - there was clear visibility, smooth seas and light winds. With the intention of returning as quickly as possible (due to unexpected delays in their fishing operations), the ship's mate set the vessel on a heading of 184\u00b0 and proceeded at a speed of {{convert|9|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}} to keep close to the coast in order to save time. At 21:42 the heading was set to 204\u00b0.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 22:30 the skipper (a 56-year-old Spanish national){{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=7}} took over watch from the mate, who went to bed. The skipper over the next 2 hours made five adjustments to the ships' heading in order to follow the coast. The skipper during this time worked on fish landing records and other managerial work. It is not known how often the vessel's position was checked.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}}\n\nAt 00:23 on 4 August, vessel was set to heading of 206\u00b0 with the aim of keeping around {{Convert|3.5|nmi|km mi|abbr=}} away from any navigational risk. The skipper did not see any hazards on the [[chartplotter]], and while he did see a [[lighthouse]] light towards the port bow, he assumed it was a lighthouse on the mainland.{{sfn|MAIB|2020}}\n\nAt an unspecified time, the skipper left the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], and (according to a [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] report) while the skipper was returning to his post at 01:24, ''Coelleira'' ran aground on the Clubb travelling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h mph|abbr=}}. The crew awoke with the sound of the collision, whereupon they assembled in the wheelhouse and donned [[Survival suit|survival suits]] and [[life jackets]]. Two lifeboats were launched off the starboard side.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=2}} At 01:29 the Shetland [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] were notified of the accident, and in response the [[Aith]] lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were sent to the scene. All 15{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=12}} crew were winched aboard the helicopter, and were returned to [[Lerwick]] uninjured.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4}}\n[[File:Coelleira wrecked on the Clubb, Ve Skerries post salvage attempt.jpg|left|thumb|''Coelleira'' on its port side after the salvage attempt]]\nAttempts were subsequently made to refloat the vessel. The ship was surveyed with assistance from the [[Sullom Voe Terminal]] tug ''Tystie'', however during the inspection the vessel rolled 5-10\u00b0 to port, at which point the men aboard were evacuated.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=4-5}} The emergency towing vessel ''Ievoli Black'' attempted to pull ''Coelleira'' off the Clubb on 7 August, however during the attempt the ship tilted over 55\u00b0 to port, and with a forecast of poor sea conditions and weather the ship was deemed unsalvageable. In the following days the ship broke up and sank.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=5}}\n\nIn its report on the incident, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] concluded that the planning of the passage between the fishing grounds and Scrabster was inadequate, the ship's position was not kept track of, and bridge was empty when the ship went aground. They posed that the skipper's decision making may have been impacted by fatigue, while the set up of the bridge's controls may have made it more difficult to observe risks to the ship.{{sfn|MAIB|2020|p=1}}\n\n== Ve Skerries Lighthouse ==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q33061460\n| name = Ve Skerries lighthouse\n| image = \n| image_name = \n| caption = \n| location = Ve Skerries<br> [[Papa Stour]]<br> [[Shetland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland Shetland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Shetland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|60.373129|-1.812250|display=inline,title}}\n| yearbuilt = 1979\n| yearlit = \n| automated = 1979\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = concrete tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with double balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower and lantern\n| height = {{convert|14.6|m|ft|0}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|17|m|ft|0}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens = \n| lightsource = batteries power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|11|mi|km|0}}\n| characteristic = Fl (2) W20s.\n| fogsignal = \n| admiralty = A3847\n| NGA = 3556\n| ARLHS = SCO-253\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board{{sfn|Rowlett|}}\n{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n}}\n\nThis modern lighthouse on the west side of Ormal was erected following the loss of ''Elinor Viking''.

MacKay, it was first lit on 27 September 1979. It is not open to the public; its exposed location makes landings by sea difficult.{{sfn|NLB|2009}}\n\n== Folklore ==\nDuring his tour of Shetland, [[Samuel Hibbert-Ware|Samuel Hibbert]] reported that the Ve Skerries were recounted by Shetlanders as being a retreat of the \"[[Haaf-fish]]\" (more commonly known as selkies) - creatures that would take the appearance of seal, but could take off their skins and would appear human, allowing them to fraternise on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=567}} Because [[Seal hunting|seal clubbing]] was (in the past) practised, and because seals would tend to lie on the Ve Skerries, the islanders of [[Papa Stour]] would go there to hunt the seals for the purpose of retrieving their skins, and according to these tales, would sometimes end up hunting the selkies.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=596-567}}\n\nOne such tale attested that a seal hunter in a party of several, after killing and skinning several seals, was caught out by a sudden swell which caused the rest of the group to assemble in their boat, but left him stranded. Despite trying to rescue him, he had to be abandoned due to the worsening weather. Several selkies (in the form of seals) then landed on the Ve Skerries, took off their skins and proceeded to rescue those of their kind who had been clubbed, stunned and skinned by the hunters. Those who had been skinned began to regain consciousness, and expressed their sorrow over the loss of their only way to return home{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=568}} (each selkie only possessing a single skin).{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=566}} In particular, one selkie named Ollavitinus would not be able to return to his wives and would be imprisoned on land.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|pp=568-569}} When the stranded hunter was spotted, Ollavitinus' mother Gioga offered to transport him back to Papa Stour as long as he would return her son's skin, which the hunter agreed to. With the weather worsening, the hunter feared he would not be able to hold on to the seal skin of Gioga all the way back, and pleaded to be allowed to cut holes in her skin to which he could hold, to which Gioga complied. The hunter was successfully transported to Akers Geo, Papa Stour, after which he dutifully retrieved Ollavitinus' skin from a skeo in Hamna Voe, allowing him to return to the sea and his wives.{{sfn|Hibbert|1822|p=569}}\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n\n* [[Out Skerries]]\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?211405|title=FV Ben Doran (A178) (+1930)|last=Tony|first=Allen|date=2018-05-06|website=The Wrecksite|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-05|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite Bayanne|access-date=2020-03-05|id=I108505|individual-first=George Theodore|individual-last=Kay|date=2008-03-02|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/john-j-grahams-shetland-dictionary.php?word=2542|title=Tide-lumps|last=Graham|first=John|date=|website=Shetland ForWirds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Samuel|url=https://archive.org/details/adescriptionshe00hibbgoog|title=A Description of the Shetland Islands, Comprising an Account of their Geology, Scenery, Antiquities, and Superstitions|publisher=Archibald Constable and Co|year=1822|isbn=|edition=1st|location=Edinburgh|pages=|ref=harv|author-link=Samuel Hibbert-Ware|via=archive.org}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|url=https://archive.org/details/anetymodictofthenornlanginshet/|title=An etymological dictionary of the Norn language in Shetland|publisher=David Nutt (A.

The series is based on the [[Gogglebox|original UK version]] and features 15 groups of families and friends from around Ireland who react to Irish, British and American television shows broadcast in Ireland.  As well as RT\u00c9, [[Virgin Media Television (Republic of Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]] and TG4, British channels [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]] and [[Channel 4]] are also available to ROI viewers so these are included in the programmes reviewed along with some broadcast on satellite channels such as [[Sky One]], [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] and [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/tv3-reveal-three-families-of-gogglebox-ireland-35060186.html|title=TV3 reveal three families of Gogglebox Ireland|publisher=Independent.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarenow.com/news/blessington-family-to-star-on-gogglebox-tonight/119774|title=Blessington family to star on Gogglebox tonight|publisher=Kildare Now}}</ref><ref name=\"tv3.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.ie/xpose/article/meet-the-families/217743/The-Tully-Twins--Fergal--Neal|title=The Tully Twins \u2013 Fergal & Neal - TV3 Xpos\u00e9|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vipmagazine.ie/a-new-family-will-hit-our-screens-tonight-on-gogglebox-ireland/|title=A new family will hit our screens tonight on Gogglebox Ireland|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe show, which follows 15 groups of families and friends from Ireland, is part of the [[Gogglebox#Other versions|international ''Gogglebox'' franchise]]. It was ordered in early 2016 and premiered on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] airing fourteen episodes from Thursday 22 September 2016 until 29 December 2016 in series 1 and returning on Wednesday 8 February 2017 with series 2 which ended with a highlights episode subtitled 'Best Bits' on Wednesday 3 May 2017. Series three began on Wednesday 13 September 2017 - with repeats on Saturday nights at 10.30pm - and ended on Wednesday 22 November.\n\nThe series broke new ground in the final episode of Series 1 when it featured cast's children and additional family members joining them to review the biggest TV show of the year in Ireland ''[[The Late Late Toy Show]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/gogglebox-ireland-toy-show-3129341-Dec2016|title=The cast of Gogglebox Ireland gathered their kids around the telly for the Toy Show|last=Elkin|first=David|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFollowing strong ratings, the series was renewed for a second series on 20 November 2016, which began broadcasting on 8 February 2017, consisting of twelve episodes and a highlights show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/gogglebox-ireland-are-looking-for-people-to-join-the-next-series-35230653.html|title=Gogglebox Ireland are looking for people to join the next series - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/gogglebox-ireland-review-this-is-a-great-way-to-watch-telly-1.2802320|title=Gogglebox Ireland review: this is a great way to watch telly|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}</ref> Series 2 saw the introduction of five new house holds from all around the country; Lauara and Aisling (Greystones), Tadgh and Ettie (County Clare), Shelly and John (Ballina), Dawn and Dale (Cork) and The Moran Family (Portlaoise)\n\nSeries 3 introduced two new households from Dublin City Centre (Couple Siobh\u00e1n and Pat) and the Cooley Peninsula (Friends Michael, David and Gerry.)  Jamie welcomed baby Cobey to the Cabra household while, in Navan, Loretta gave birth to baby Asha in early November.\n\nIn the final episode of Series 3, the cast of Daddy's Home 2 - Mel Gibson, John Lithgow, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg - featured as a guest 'family' on the show and reviewed 'Ireland's Fittest Family', 'Fair City' and 'Stetsons and Stilettos.'  <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/mel-gibson-will-ferrell-gogglebox-ireland-3712048-Nov2017/|title=Will Ferrell, Mel Gibson and the lads were thoroughly engrossed in Fair City on Gogglebox|last=Loftus|first=Valerie|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 August 2018, it was announced that Gogglebox Ireland would return for a fourth series.<ref>https://www.virginmediatelevision.ie/xpose/article/news/274482/Virgin-Media-Television-announces-NEW-season-schedule</ref> The series returned to [[Virgin Media One]] on 5 September 2018.\n\nOnce TV3 was bought by cable tv company Liberty Global, via their Virgin Media Ireland label, the \"Googlebox Ireland\" version of the series became very confusingly meta between corporate siblings, and in effect advertising for Virgin Media Ireland (the cable tv company), and Virgin Media Television (the former TV3 group of television channels, owned by the same cable tv company). Googlebox Ireland (the series format and actual series), is ultimately owned and made by All3Media, a company ultimately owned by Liberty Global & Discovery, and shown on a tv channel (TV3/Virgin Media Television Ireland) owned by Liberty Global, in turn featuring programmes shown on their own TV3/Virgin Media channels available in Ireland, with some programmes in turn also made by other parts of the All3Media/Discovery programming library, as well as featuring third party programmes from other Irish and UK channels, and online such as Netflix, also available via the Virgin Media cable tv hardware. In yet more corporate sibling cross-promotion, the show understandably features product placement of the Virgin Media Ireland cable tv equipment, such as the remote, and the series, shown on a channel owned and branded as Virgin Media Television, is sponsored by Virgin Media Ireland (the cable tv company), which also confusingly also both feature the series in their own on-demand catch-up service catalogues.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n\n|british=y\n\n|color1=#006400\n|link1=#Series 1 (2016)\n|episodes1=14\n|start1=22 September 2016\n|end1=22 December 2016\n\n|color2=#36454F\n|link2=#Series 2 (2017)\n|episodes2=13\n|start2=8 February 2017\n|end2=26 April 2017\n\n|color3=#000000\n|link3=#Series 3 (2017)\n|episodes3=13\n|start3=13 September 2017\n|end3=22 November 2017\n\n|color4=##18178D\n|link4=#Series 4 (2018)\n|episodes4=13\n|start4=5 September 2018\n|end4=14 November 2018\n\n|color5=#982A13|end5=TBA|episodes5=8|link5=#Series 5 (2019)|start5=11 September 2019}}\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

The series is based on the [[Gogglebox|original UK version]] and features 15 groups of families and friends from around Ireland who react to Irish, British and American television shows broadcast in Ireland.  As well as RT\u00c9, [[Virgin Media Television (Republic of Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]] and TG4, British channels [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]] and [[Channel 4]] are also available to ROI viewers so these are included in the programmes reviewed along with some broadcast on satellite channels such as [[Sky One]], [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] and [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/tv3-reveal-three-families-of-gogglebox-ireland-35060186.html|title=TV3 reveal three families of Gogglebox Ireland|publisher=Independent.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarenow.com/news/blessington-family-to-star-on-gogglebox-tonight/119774|title=Blessington family to star on Gogglebox tonight|publisher=Kildare Now}}</ref><ref name=\"tv3.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.ie/xpose/article/meet-the-families/217743/The-Tully-Twins--Fergal--Neal|title=The Tully Twins \u2013 Fergal & Neal - TV3 Xpos\u00e9|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vipmagazine.ie/a-new-family-will-hit-our-screens-tonight-on-gogglebox-ireland/|title=A new family will hit our screens tonight on Gogglebox Ireland|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe show, which follows 15 groups of families and friends from Ireland, is part of the [[Gogglebox#Other versions|international ''Gogglebox'' franchise]]. It was ordered in early 2016 and premiered on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] airing fourteen episodes from Thursday 22 September 2016 until 29 December 2016 in series 1 and returning on Wednesday 8 February 2017 with series 2 which ended with a highlights episode subtitled 'Best Bits' on Wednesday 3 May 2017. Series three began on Wednesday 13 September 2017 - with repeats on Saturday nights at 10.30pm - and ended on Wednesday 22 November.\n\nThe series broke new ground in the final episode of Series 1 when it featured cast's children and additional family members joining them to review the biggest TV show of the year in Ireland ''[[The Late Late Toy Show]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/gogglebox-ireland-toy-show-3129341-Dec2016|title=The cast of Gogglebox Ireland gathered their kids around the telly for the Toy Show|last=Elkin|first=David|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFollowing strong ratings, the series was renewed for a second series on 20 November 2016, which began broadcasting on 8 February 2017, consisting of twelve episodes and a highlights show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/gogglebox-ireland-are-looking-for-people-to-join-the-next-series-35230653.html|title=Gogglebox Ireland are looking for people to join the next series - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/gogglebox-ireland-review-this-is-a-great-way-to-watch-telly-1.2802320|title=Gogglebox Ireland review: this is a great way to watch telly|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}</ref> Series 2 saw the introduction of five new house holds from all around the country; Lauara and Aisling (Greystones), Tadgh and Ettie (County Clare), Shelly and John (Ballina), Dawn and Dale (Cork) and The Moran Family (Portlaoise)\n\nSeries 3 introduced two new households from Dublin City Centre (Couple Siobh\u00e1n and Pat) and the Cooley Peninsula (Friends Michael, David and Gerry.)  Jamie welcomed baby Cobey to the Cabra household while, in Navan, Loretta gave birth to baby Asha in early November.\n\nIn the final episode of Series 3, the cast of Daddy's Home 2 - Mel Gibson, John Lithgow, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg - featured as a guest 'family' on the show and reviewed 'Ireland's Fittest Family', 'Fair City' and 'Stetsons and Stilettos.'  <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/mel-gibson-will-ferrell-gogglebox-ireland-3712048-Nov2017/|title=Will Ferrell, Mel Gibson and the lads were thoroughly engrossed in Fair City on Gogglebox|last=Loftus|first=Valerie|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 August 2018, it was announced that Gogglebox Ireland would return for a fourth series.<ref>https://www.virginmediatelevision.ie/xpose/article/news/274482/Virgin-Media-Television-announces-NEW-season-schedule</ref> The series returned to [[Virgin Media One]] on 5 September 2018.\n\nOnce TV3 was bought by cable tv company Liberty Global, via their Virgin Media Ireland label, the \"Googlebox Ireland\" version of the series became very confusingly meta between corporate siblings, and in effect advertising for Virgin Media Ireland (the cable tv company), and Virgin Media Television (the former TV3 group of television channels, owned by the same cable tv company). Googlebox Ireland (the series format and actual series), is ultimately owned and made by All3Media, a company ultimately owned by Liberty Global & Discovery, and shown on a tv channel (TV3/Virgin Media Television Ireland) owned by Liberty Global, in turn featuring programmes shown on their own TV3/Virgin Media channels available in Ireland, with some programmes in turn also made by other parts of the All3Media/Discovery programming library, as well as featuring third party programmes from other Irish and UK channels, and online such as Netflix, also available via the Virgin Media cable tv hardware. In yet more corporate sibling cross-promotion, the show understandably features product placement of the Virgin Media Ireland cable tv equipment, such as the remote, and the series, shown on a channel owned and branded as Virgin Media Television, is sponsored by Virgin Media Ireland (the cable tv company), which also confusingly also both feature the series in their own on-demand catch-up service catalogues.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n\n|british=y\n\n|color1=#006400\n|link1=#Series 1 (2016)\n|episodes1=14\n|start1=22 September 2016\n|end1=22 December 2016\n\n|color2=#36454F\n|link2=#Series 2 (2017)\n|episodes2=13\n|start2=8 February 2017\n|end2=26 April 2017\n\n|color3=#000000\n|link3=#Series 3 (2017)\n|episodes3=13\n|start3=13 September 2017\n|end3=22 November 2017\n\n|color4=##18178D\n|link4=#Series 4 (2018)\n|episodes4=13\n|start4=5 September 2018\n|end4=14 November 2018\n\n|color5=#982A13|end5=TBA|episodes5=8|link5=#Series 5 (2019)|start5=11 September 2019}}\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
