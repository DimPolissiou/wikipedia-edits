It is designed primarily for two uses: fans interested in [[fantasy baseball]], and professionals in the baseball business trying to predict the performance and [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] of major league players. Unlike most other baseball projection systems, PECOTA relies on matching a given current player to a set of \"comparable\" players whose past performance can serve as a guide to how the given current player is likely to perform in the future. Unlike most other such systems, PECOTA also calculates a range of probable performance levels rather than a single predicted value on a given measure such as [[earned run average]] or [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]].\n\nPECOTA projections were first published by [[Baseball Prospectus]] in the 2003 edition of its annual book as well as online by ''BaseballProspectus.com.''

Silver responded with the offer of a $1,000 wager (for charity) over the outcome of the election. ''The New York Times'' public editor Margaret Sullivan, while defending Silver's analysis, characterized the wager as \"a bad idea\" as it gave the appearance of a partisan motive for Silver, and \"inappropriate\" for someone perceived as a ''Times'' journalist (although Silver was not a member of the newspaper's staff).<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Margaret|title=Under Attack, Nate Silver Picks the Wrong Defense|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/under-attack-nate-silver-picks-the-wrong-defense/|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102233053/http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/under-attack-nate-silver-picks-the-wrong-defense/|archive-date=November 2, 2012|url-status=live}}.

Silver takes a big-picture approach to using statistical tools, combining sources of unique data (e.g., timing a minor league ball player's fastball using a radar gun), with historical data and principles of sound statistical analysis; Silver argues that many of these are violated by many pollsters and pundits who nonetheless have important media roles. Case studies in the book include baseball, elections, [[climate change]], the financial crash, poker, and weather forecasting. These different topics illustrate different statistical principles. As a reviewer in ''The New York Times'' notes: \"It's largely about evaluating predictions in a variety of fields, from finance to weather to epidemiology. We learn about a handful of successes: when, for instance, meteorologists predict a hurricane's landfall 72 hours in advance.... But mostly we learn about failures. It turns out we're not even close to predicting the next catastrophic earthquake or the spread of the next killer bird flu, despite the enormous amounts of brainpower trained on these questions in the past few decades\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Noam |last=Scheiber |title=Known Unknowns: ''The Signal and the Noise,'' by Nate Silver |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver.html |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006220101/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver.html |archive-date=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Blogs and other publications==\n;Blogs\n* [http://fivethirtyeight.com ''FiveThirtyEight'' blog, now owned by ABC]\n* [https://www.baseballprospectus.com/author/nate_silver/ Nate Silver's ''Baseball Prospectus'' article archive] (2003\u20132009)\n* [http://burritobracket.blogspot.com/ Nate Silver's ''The Burrito Bracket''] (2007)\n\n;Other publications\n* Nate Silver, \"The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York: A Quantitative Index of the 50 Most Satisfying Places to Live\", ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]],'' [http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65374/ April 11, 2010].\n* Nate Silver, \"The Influence Index\", ''Time,'' [http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984713_1984669,00.html April 29, 2010].\n* Nate Silver and Walter Hickey, \"Best Picture Math\", ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]],'' [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/03/oscar-winner-predictions-nate-silver March 2014].\n* [[Gareth Cook]] (Editor), Nate Silver (Introduction).

Through his work as Founding Director and Editor in Chief of FiveThirtyEight.com Nate Silver has made significant, innovative contributions to how journalists report and the general public understands presidential and congressional elections in the United States, and how public opinion polling is used in that framework. Silver's focus on the Electoral College, rather than the popular vote, has fundamentally reshaped how presidential elections are reported, leading to a greater public and journalistic awareness of how the electoral political process operates. Silver's application of probability theory and statistical inference to politics, public policy, economics, and daily life in FiveThirtyEight.com has advanced and highlighted statistical literacy and thinking as an approach to solving problems in a number of areas. One example is in the use of polling aggregation to identify central tendencies and outliers in the analysis of elections. AAPOR also recognizes and laud's Silver's commitment to transparency and full disclosure in FiveThirtyEight's research methods and practice.

It is designed primarily for two uses: fans interested in [[fantasy baseball]], and professionals in the baseball business trying to predict the performance and [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] of major league players. Unlike most other baseball projection systems, PECOTA relies on matching a given current player to a set of \"comparable\" players whose past performance can serve as a guide to how the given current player is likely to perform in the future. Unlike most other such systems, PECOTA also calculates a range of probable performance levels rather than a single predicted value on a given measure such as [[earned run average]] or [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]].\n\nPECOTA projections were first published by [[Baseball Prospectus]] in the 2003 edition of its annual book as well as online by ''BaseballProspectus.com.''

Silver takes a big-picture approach to using statistical tools, combining sources of unique data (e.g., timing a minor league ball player's fastball using a radar gun), with historical data and principles of sound statistical analysis; Silver argues that many of these are violated by many pollsters and pundits who nonetheless have important media roles. Case studies in the book include baseball, elections, [[climate change]], the financial crash, poker, and weather forecasting. These different topics illustrate different statistical principles. As a reviewer in ''The New York Times'' notes: \"It's largely about evaluating predictions in a variety of fields, from finance to weather to epidemiology. We learn about a handful of successes: when, for instance, meteorologists predict a hurricane's landfall 72 hours in advance.... But mostly we learn about failures. It turns out we're not even close to predicting the next catastrophic earthquake or the spread of the next killer bird flu, despite the enormous amounts of brainpower trained on these questions in the past few decades\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Noam |last=Scheiber |title=Known Unknowns: ''The Signal and the Noise,'' by Nate Silver |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver.html |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006220101/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver.html |archive-date=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Blogs and other publications==\n;Blogs\n* [http://fivethirtyeight.com ''FiveThirtyEight'' blog, now owned by ABC]\n* [https://www.baseballprospectus.com/author/nate_silver/ Nate Silver's ''Baseball Prospectus'' article archive] (2003\u20132009)\n* [http://burritobracket.blogspot.com/ Nate Silver's ''The Burrito Bracket''] (2007)\n\n;Other publications\n* Nate Silver, \"The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York: A Quantitative Index of the 50 Most Satisfying Places to Live\", ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]],'' [http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65374/ April 11, 2010].\n* Nate Silver, \"The Influence Index\", ''Time,'' [http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984713_1984669,00.html April 29, 2010].\n* Nate Silver and Walter Hickey, \"Best Picture Math\", ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]],'' [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/03/oscar-winner-predictions-nate-silver March 2014].\n* [[Gareth Cook]] (Editor), Nate Silver (Introduction).

Through his work as Founding Director and Editor in Chief of FiveThirtyEight.com Nate Silver has made significant, innovative contributions to how journalists report and the general public understands presidential and congressional elections in the United States, and how public opinion polling is used in that framework. Silver's focus on the Electoral College, rather than the popular vote, has fundamentally reshaped how presidential elections are reported, leading to a greater public and journalistic awareness of how the electoral political process operates. Silver's application of probability theory and statistical inference to politics, public policy, economics, and daily life in FiveThirtyEight.com has advanced and highlighted statistical literacy and thinking as an approach to solving problems in a number of areas. One example is in the use of polling aggregation to identify central tendencies and outliers in the analysis of elections. AAPOR also recognizes and laud's Silver's commitment to transparency and full disclosure in FiveThirtyEight's research methods and practice.

Babur ascended the throne of Fergana in its capital [[Akhsikent]] in 1494 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion. He conquered [[Samarkand]] two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501 his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when [[Muhammad Shaybani Khan]] defeated him. In 1504 he conquered [[Kabul]], which was under the putative rule of Abdur Razaq Mirza, the infant heir of [[Ulugh Beg II]]. Babur formed a partnership with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ruler [[Ismail I]] and reconquered parts of [[Turkistan]], including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly-conquered lands to the [[Shaybanids|Sheybanids]].\n\nAfter losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to India. At that time, the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]], whereas [[Rajputana]] was ruled by a Hindu [[Rajput| Rajput Confederacy]], led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]]. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526 CE and founded the Mughal empire. He faced opposition from [[Rana Sanga]], who at first promised to help Babur defeat Ibrahim Lodi; however he later backed out upon realising that Babur had plans to stay in India. The Rana prepared an army of [[Rajputs]] and [[Afghan]]s to force Babur out of India, however the Rana was defeated in the [[Battle of Khanwa]] (1527) after which he was poisoned to death (1528) by his own men.<ref>Satish Chandra, 2006, pp=32\u201333</ref>\n\nBabur married several times. Notable among his sons are [[Humayun]], [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Hindal Mirza]]. Babur died in 1530 in [[Agra]] and Humayun succeeded him. Babur was first buried in Agra but, as per his wishes, his remains were moved to Kabul and reburied.<ref name=\"Necipo\u011flu\" /> As a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself a Timurid and [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]].<ref name=\"Richards1995\">\n{{citation\n |last= Richards |first= John F.\n |title= The Mughal Empire\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC\n |year= 1995 |publisher= Cambridge University Press\n |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-521-56603-2\n}}\n</ref>\nHe ranks as a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].

Babur ascended the throne of Fergana in its capital [[Akhsikent]] in 1494 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion. He conquered [[Samarkand]] two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501 his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when [[Muhammad Shaybani Khan]] defeated him. In 1504 he conquered [[Kabul]], which was under the putative rule of Abdur Razaq Mirza, the infant heir of [[Ulugh Beg II]]. Babur formed a partnership with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ruler [[Ismail I]] and reconquered parts of [[Turkistan]], including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly-conquered lands to the [[Shaybanids|Sheybanids]].\n\nAfter losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to India. At that time, the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]], whereas [[Rajputana]] was ruled by a Hindu [[Rajput| Rajput Confederacy]], led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]]. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526 CE and founded the Mughal empire. He faced opposition from [[Rana Sanga]], who at first promised to help Babur defeat Ibrahim Lodi; however he later backed out upon realising that Babur had plans to stay in India. The Rana prepared an army of [[Rajputs]] and [[Afghan]]s to force Babur out of India, however the Rana was defeated in the [[Battle of Khanwa]] (1527) after which he was poisoned to death (1528) by his own men.<ref>Satish Chandra, 2006, pp=32\u201333</ref>\n\nBabur married several times. Notable among his sons are [[Humayun]], [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Hindal Mirza]]. Babur died in 1530 in [[Agra]] and Humayun succeeded him. Babur was first buried in Agra but, as per his wishes, his remains were moved to Kabul and reburied.<ref name=\"Necipo\u011flu\" /> As a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself a Timurid and [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]].<ref name=\"Richards1995\">\n{{citation\n |last= Richards |first= John F.\n |title= The Mughal Empire\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC\n |year= 1995 |publisher= Cambridge University Press\n |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-521-56603-2\n}}\n</ref>\nHe ranks as a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].

The [[United States]] has never had religious parties (unlike much of the world, especially in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]]). There has never been an American Catholic religious party, either local, state or national.\n\nIn 1776 Catholics comprised less than 1% of the population of the new nation, but  their presence grew rapidly after 1840 with [[immigration to the United States|immigration]] from Germany, Ireland, and later from Italy, Poland and elsewhere in [[Catholic Europe]] from 1840 to 1914, and also from Latin America in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Catholics now comprise 25% to 27% of the national vote, with over 68 million members today. 85% of today's Catholics report their faith to be \"somewhat\" to \"very important\" to them.<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm CARA's New Book Identifies Trends in U.S. Catholic Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226151441/http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm# |date=2006-02-26 }}, Catholicism USA</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcatholicdirectory.com/ ''The Official Catholic Directory'' 2009].</ref> From the mid-19th century down to 1964 Catholics were solidly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], sometimes at the 80\u201390% level. From the 1930s to the 1950s Catholics formed a core part of the [[New Deal Coalition]], with overlapping memberships in the church, [[labor union]]s, big city [[political machine|machines]], and the working class, all of which promoted [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal policy positions]] in domestic affairs and [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\nSince the election of a Catholic President in 1960, Catholics have split about 50\u201350 between the two major parties in national elections. With the decline of unions and big city machines, and with upward mobility into the middle classes, Catholics have drifted away from liberalism and toward [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] on economic issues (such as taxes). Since the end of the [[Cold War]], their strong anti-Communism has faded in importance. On social issues the Catholic Church takes strong positions against [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and has formed coalitions with Protestant evangelicals.<ref>[[Donald T. Critchlow]], ''Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion, and the Federal Government in Modern America'' (2001) p. 196</ref> In 2015 [[Pope Francis]] declared that [[Global warming|man-made climate change]] is caused by burning [[fossil fuel]]s. The [[Pope]] stated the warming of the planet is rooted in \"a [[Throw-away society|throwaway culture]]\" and the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as it pursues short-term economic gains. However, the Pope's statements on climate change were generally met with indifference among Catholics<ref>{{cite news|first=Nicola |last=Davis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/pope-franciss-edict-on-climate-change-has-fallen-on-deaf-ears-study-finds |title=Pope Francis's edict on climate change has fallen on closed ears, study finds |work=The Guardian |date= 2016-10-24|accessdate=2019-11-22}}</ref> while Catholic commentaries ranged from praise to dismissal, with some stating that it was not binding or magisterial due to its scientific nature.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2015/06/24/can-a-good-catholic-dissent-from-laudato-si/ | title=Can a good Catholic dissent from Laudato Si'?| date=2015-06-24}}</ref>  The Pope's statements on these issues were most prominently laid out in encyclical ''[[Laudato si']]''.

By 1840, there were about 600,000 Catholics in the United States. In the 1840s, 200,000 Irish immigrated to escape poverty.  The [[Irish Potato Famine]] in 1845 caused the Irish population in America to reach 962,000, the number doubling in the next ten years.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/history/americanhistory/immigrants-and-immigration-aaw-02/ Immigrants and Immigration], Americans at War, Macmillan Reference USA</ref> Even larger numbers of immigrants arrived from traditionally Catholic regions of Germany and other parts of Europe. To the extent that these new arrivals remained inside ethnic communities, they typically joined the local Catholic church that through the local diocese was in communion with Rome; how many cut their ties with the Catholic Church is a matter of speculation.<ref>Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, ''The Churching of America, 1776-1990: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy'' (1993) p. 273. Apart from the formation in 1897 of a [[Polish National Catholic Church]], there were no alternative Catholic denominations formed for immigrants. By contrast the Lutherans formed numerous denominations in the U.S.</ref> The Irish Catholics took controlling positions in the Catholic Church, labor unions, and Democratic organizations in the big cities, thus forming overlapping centers of strength. The sudden new arrival of so many Catholics, charges of political corruption, and fears of papal interference caused [[anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]] to grow, including the short-lived [[Know Nothings]] party in the 1850s which demanded a purification of elections and statutes from Catholic influence.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nMany Catholics served in the Civil War armies, both North and South, and the bishops rejected the antiwar and anti-draft sentiments of some members. The rapid rise of the Irish out of poverty, and the continued growth in membership, especially in industrial and urban areas, made the church the largest denomination in the U.S. Distrusting public schools dominated by Protestants, Catholics built their own network of parochial elementary schools (and, later, high schools), as well as colleges, and public funding for parochial schools was a controversial issue.{{r|silk20081103}} As the [[Bennett Law]] episode in 1890 in Wisconsin demonstrated, Catholics were willing to cooperate politically with German Lutherans to protect their parochial schools. A distinct Catholic vote existed, however; in the late 19th century, 75% of Irish and German Catholics in America voted for Democratic presidential candidates. {{r|silk20081103}}  The Irish increasingly controlled the Democratic party machinery in major cities.<ref>Steven P. Erie, ''Rainbow's end: Irish-Americans and the dilemmas of urban machine politics, 1840-1985'' (1990)</ref>\n\nReligious lines were sharply drawn in the North in the [[Third Party System]] that lasted from the 1850s to the 1890s.  (In the South the Catholics voted the same as Protestants, with race as the main dividing line.)<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\">Kleppner (1979)</ref>  Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other Protestant [[pietists]] in the North were tightly linked to the GOP. In sharp contrast, [[liturgical]] groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition.  While both parties cut across economic class structures, the Democrats were supported more heavily by its lower tiers.\n\nCultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking. Liturgical churches comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of personal morality issues. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up elections in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (and repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\"/>\n\n[[File:Grant to Hayes - I guess that reform bait wont work this side.

From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican elections, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nThe [[Knights of Labor]] was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, this was the largest labor union in the United States.  It is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including [[Terence Powderly]], its president from 1881 onward).\n\nIn ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), [[Pope Leo XIII]] criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations.  He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church's defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html |title=''Rerum novarum'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n''Rerum novarum'' provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==20th century==\n\nBy 1900, Catholics represented 14 percent of the total U.S. population, soon became the single largest religious denomination in the country.<ref>Terry Matthews: [http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html Catholicism in Nineteenth Century America] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010529012128/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html# |date=2001-05-29 }}, Lectures for Religion, Wake Forrest University</ref> Still, Catholics did not hold many high offices in government. Only one of the first 54 justices on the [[United States Supreme Court]] was Catholic, [[Roger B. Taney]], appointed in 1836.\n\n===Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction===\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], many hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction. [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. Combining Progressive thought and Catholic theology, Ryan believed that government intervention was the most effective means of affecting positive change for his church as well as working people and the poor. On February 12, 1919, the National Catholic War Council issued the \"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction\".\n\nThe Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was therefore questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some, including Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backed it, for example, and business groups criticized it.\n\n===Defense of parochial school system===\n{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\n\nAfter World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \"foreign\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arrived in [[Oregon]] and quickly attracted as many as 14,000 members, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922. Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.\n\nIn 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect,<ref>Howard, J. Paul.

He quoted in a footnote the part of the case:\n\n<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right coupled with the high duty, to recognize, and prepare him for additional duties.</blockquote>\n\n===Catholic Worker Movement===\n{{Main|Catholic Worker Movement}}\n[[File:Dorothy Day 1934.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dorothy Day]]]]\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement began as a means to combine [[Dorothy Day]]'s history in American social activism, [[anarchism]], and [[pacifism]] with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of [[distributism]]), five years after her 1927 conversion.<ref>\"[http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html \"Dorothy Day, Prophet of Pacifism for the Catholic Church\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927232314/http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html |date=2008-09-27 }}\" from \"Houston Catholic Worker\" newspaper, October 1997</ref>\n\nThe group started with the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' [[newspaper]], created to promote [[Catholic social teaching]] and stake out a neutral, [[pacifism|pacifist]] position in the wartorn 1930s. It grew into a \"[[house of hospitality]]\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; more than 30 independent but affiliated CW communities had been founded by 1941. Well over 100 communities exist today, including several in [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, Canada, [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Catholic Worker Communities |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |accessdate=2008-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220122836/http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |archivedate=2008-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar houses of hospitality were established by Russian immigrant and Catholic social worker, [[Catherine Doherty]], founder of Madonna House.\n\n====National Catholic Welfare Conference====\n{{main|National Catholic Welfare Council#National Catholic Welfare Conference}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n===1930s===\nHistorian John McGreevey notes, \"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like [[Pittsburgh]]'s Monsignor [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P. Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\"  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.\n\n===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===\nThe [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923\u20131937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due partly by lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.\n\n==Party affiliation==\nBefore the 1960s, when cultural changes lead to an incremental liberalization of the Democratic Party, Catholics were seen as staunch Democrats. The Democratic Party ran Al Smith, the first Catholic presidential candidate by a major party, in 1928, and, except when the ticket was headed by a [[Southern United States|Southern]] candidate, has nominated a Catholic for president or vice president in every election since 1960 except for [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] (where a [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Michael Dukakis]], was the presidential nominee).\n\nSince the 1960s, the Catholic vote has come to reflect the nation as a whole instead of being predominantly Democratic.{{r|silk20081103}} In the 60s and early 70s, a number of Catholics and Southern whites abandoned their traditional affiliation with the Democratic Party and began to support the Republican Party.  This shift is evidenced by the fact that Nixon received 33% of the Catholic vote in the 1968 election compared to 52% in 1972.  As a group, Catholics represented a quarter of the nation's electorate and were now one of the nation's largest swing groups.  Both parties began to aggressively woo the Catholic voters.  Although the Catholic hierarchy could not dictate who Catholics voted for, they did have a substantial influence over the faithful in their dioceses.  Politicians were aware that the bishops could direct significant time, energy and money to support the issues that were important to them.  From their perspective, the bishops were eager to regain some of the influence that their predecessors had wielded in the earlier part of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HeyerRozell2008_17\">{{cite book|last1=Heyer|first1=Kristin E.|last2=Rozell|first2=Mark J.|last3=Genovese|first3=Michael A.|title=Catholics and politics: the dynamic tension between faith and power|url=https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris|url-access=registration|accessdate=19 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-215-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris/page/17 17]}}</ref>  Since the 1970s non-Hispanic white Catholics have voted majority Republican very reliably while a majority of Hispanic or Latino Catholics have voted Democrat.<ref name=\"Religion, Race page 65-66\">Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 65-66</ref>\n\nIn his successful [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] campaign against [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]] won about half of the Catholic vote and a majority of Catholics who were non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 66</ref> \"[[Reagan Democrats]]\", many of them non-Hispanic white, blue-collar Catholics, comprised 25% of the Democrats who voted for Reagan, and formed an important part of his support in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] as well.

Although the majority of Catholics in 1984 remained Democrats, compared to 1980 Catholic votes switched to Reagan at about the same level as most Protestant groups. Reagan's vice president [[George H. W. Bush]] won about the same number of votes as [[Michael Dukakis]], making [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] the third presidential election in a row in which Catholics failed to support the Democratic candidate as they traditionally did.{{r|prendergast1999}}{{rp|186\u2013187,191\u2013192,194}}\n\nAlthough about one third of Catholics voted for Bush's reelection in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], most Catholic defectors switched to independent [[Ross Perot]], not the successful Democrat [[Bill Clinton]]. Unlike previous elections (such as in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], when [[George McGovern]]'s Catholic support was eight percentage points higher than overall) the Catholic vote was not more Democratic than the overall electorate, but split almost identically to it. The trend away from a Democratic dominance of the Catholic vote continued in [[United States elections, 1994|1994]], when for the first time in history Democrats did not receive a majority of Catholic votes in elections for the House of Representatives; as with 1992, the Catholic vote split resembled that of the overall electorate.  White non-Hispanic Catholics however, remained majority Republican.<ref name=\"Religion, Race page 65-66\"/> This trend reversed slightly in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], when Clinton's share of Catholics in general was four percentage points ahead of overall, and they comprised about half of the margin between him and the unsuccessful challenger [[Robert Dole]].

Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John F.

Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected president, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[pope]] in [[Rome]].  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, he decided to try to put the issue to rest.\n\nTo address fears that his Roman Catholicism would influence his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters \u2014 and the Church does not speak for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|accessdate=2007-09-17|last=Kennedy|first=John F.|date=2002-06-18|website=American Rhetoric|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911175450/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|archivedate=2007-09-11}}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.\n\nEven so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an absolute [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.\n\nKennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  There was a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more votes than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>''New York Times'', November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Catholics rallied to Kennedy as an affirmation of their religion and their right to have a Catholic president.\n\n==Representation in government==\n\n===Congress===\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Catholics represent 30.5% of [[Demographics of the United States Congress|the United States Congress]] as of January 2019. There are 141 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] and 22 [[United States Senate|Senators]] that are Catholic, which split as 99 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 64 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nOn January 4, 2007, [[Nancy Pelosi]], a Catholic, became the first woman elected as the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. She was elected again as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] on January 3, 2019, after serving as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] from 2003-2007 and 2011\u20132019. [[Paul Ryan]] is Catholic as well and served recently as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] from 2015 to 2019.\n\n[[Edward Kavanagh]] was nationally noticed as the first [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] elected from New England. Kavanagh was elected as a [[Jacksonian Democrats|Jacksonian]] to the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1831, to March 3, 1835.\n\n===Supreme Court===\nIn the early 1980s, there was one Catholic justice.  This changed in the mid 1980s when President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]] to the court, both Catholic. The first President [[George H. W.

The [[United States]] has never had religious parties (unlike much of the world, especially in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]]). There has never been an American Catholic religious party, either local, state or national.\n\nIn 1776 Catholics comprised less than 1% of the population of the new nation, but  their presence grew rapidly after 1840 with [[immigration to the United States|immigration]] from Germany, Ireland, and later from Italy, Poland and elsewhere in [[Catholic Europe]] from 1840 to 1914, and also from Latin America in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Catholics now comprise 25% to 27% of the national vote, with over 68 million members today. 85% of today's Catholics report their faith to be \"somewhat\" to \"very important\" to them.<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm CARA's New Book Identifies Trends in U.S. Catholic Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226151441/http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm# |date=2006-02-26 }}, Catholicism USA</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcatholicdirectory.com/ ''The Official Catholic Directory'' 2009].</ref> From the mid-19th century down to 1964 Catholics were solidly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], sometimes at the 80\u201390% level. From the 1930s to the 1950s Catholics formed a core part of the [[New Deal Coalition]], with overlapping memberships in the church, [[labor union]]s, big city [[political machine|machines]], and the working class, all of which promoted [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal policy positions]] in domestic affairs and [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\nSince the election of a Catholic President in 1960, Catholics have split about 50\u201350 between the two major parties in national elections. With the decline of unions and big city machines, and with upward mobility into the middle classes, Catholics have drifted away from liberalism and toward [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] on economic issues (such as taxes). Since the end of the [[Cold War]], their strong anti-Communism has faded in importance. On social issues the Catholic Church takes strong positions against [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and has formed coalitions with Protestant evangelicals.<ref>[[Donald T.

By 1840, there were about 600,000 Catholics in the United States. In the 1840s, 200,000 Irish immigrated to escape poverty.  The [[Irish Potato Famine]] in 1845 caused the Irish population in America to reach 962,000, the number doubling in the next ten years.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/history/americanhistory/immigrants-and-immigration-aaw-02/ Immigrants and Immigration], Americans at War, Macmillan Reference USA</ref> Even larger numbers of immigrants arrived from traditionally Catholic regions of Germany and other parts of Europe. To the extent that these new arrivals remained inside ethnic communities, they typically joined the local Catholic church that through the local diocese was in communion with Rome; how many cut their ties with the Catholic Church is a matter of speculation.<ref>Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, ''The Churching of America, 1776-1990: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy'' (1993) p. 273. Apart from the formation in 1897 of a [[Polish National Catholic Church]], there were no alternative Catholic denominations formed for immigrants. By contrast the Lutherans formed numerous denominations in the U.S.</ref> The Irish Catholics took controlling positions in the Catholic Church, labor unions, and Democratic organizations in the big cities, thus forming overlapping centers of strength. The sudden new arrival of so many Catholics, charges of political corruption, and fears of papal interference caused [[anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]] to grow, including the short-lived [[Know Nothings]] party in the 1850s which demanded a purification of elections and statutes from Catholic influence.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nMany Catholics served in the Civil War armies, both North and South, and the bishops rejected the antiwar and anti-draft sentiments of some members. The rapid rise of the Irish out of poverty, and the continued growth in membership, especially in industrial and urban areas, made the church the largest denomination in the U.S. Distrusting public schools dominated by Protestants, Catholics built their own network of parochial elementary schools (and, later, high schools), as well as colleges, and public funding for parochial schools was a controversial issue.{{r|silk20081103}} As the [[Bennett Law]] episode in 1890 in Wisconsin demonstrated, Catholics were willing to cooperate politically with German Lutherans to protect their parochial schools. A distinct Catholic vote existed, however; in the late 19th century, 75% of Irish and German Catholics in America voted for Democratic presidential candidates. {{r|silk20081103}}  The Irish increasingly controlled the Democratic party machinery in major cities.<ref>Steven P. Erie, ''Rainbow's end: Irish-Americans and the dilemmas of urban machine politics, 1840-1985'' (1990)</ref>\n\nReligious lines were sharply drawn in the North in the [[Third Party System]] that lasted from the 1850s to the 1890s.  (In the South the Catholics voted the same as Protestants, with race as the main dividing line.)<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\">Kleppner (1979)</ref>  Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other Protestant [[pietists]] in the North were tightly linked to the GOP. In sharp contrast, [[liturgical]] groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition.  While both parties cut across economic class structures, the Democrats were supported more heavily by its lower tiers.\n\nCultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking. Liturgical churches comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of personal morality issues. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up elections in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (and repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\"/>\n\n[[File:Grant to Hayes - I guess that reform bait wont work this side.

From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican elections, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nThe [[Knights of Labor]] was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, this was the largest labor union in the United States.  It is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including [[Terence Powderly]], its president from 1881 onward).\n\nIn ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), [[Pope Leo XIII]] criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations.  He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church's defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html |title=''Rerum novarum'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n''Rerum novarum'' provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==20th century==\n\nBy 1900, Catholics represented 14 percent of the total U.S. population, soon became the single largest religious denomination in the country.<ref>Terry Matthews: [http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html Catholicism in Nineteenth Century America] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010529012128/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html# |date=2001-05-29 }}, Lectures for Religion, Wake Forrest University</ref> Still, Catholics did not hold many high offices in government. Only one of the first 54 justices on the [[United States Supreme Court]] was Catholic, [[Roger B. Taney]], appointed in 1836.\n\n===Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction===\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], many hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction. [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. Combining Progressive thought and Catholic theology, Ryan believed that government intervention was the most effective means of affecting positive change for his church as well as working people and the poor. On February 12, 1919, the National Catholic War Council issued the \"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction\".\n\nThe Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was therefore questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some, including Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backed it, for example, and business groups criticized it.\n\n===Defense of parochial school system===\n{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\n\nAfter World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \"foreign\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arrived in [[Oregon]] and quickly attracted as many as 14,000 members, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922. Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.\n\nIn 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect,<ref>Howard, J. Paul.

It grew into a \"[[house of hospitality]]\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; more than 30 independent but affiliated CW communities had been founded by 1941. Well over 100 communities exist today, including several in [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, Canada, [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Catholic Worker Communities |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |accessdate=2008-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220122836/http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |archivedate=2008-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar houses of hospitality were established by Russian immigrant and Catholic social worker, [[Catherine Doherty]], founder of Madonna House.\n\n====National Catholic Welfare Conference====\n{{main|National Catholic Welfare Council#National Catholic Welfare Conference}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n===1930s===\nHistorian John McGreevey notes, \"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like [[Pittsburgh]]'s Monsignor [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P. Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\"  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.\n\n===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===\nThe [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923\u20131937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due partly by lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.\n\n==Party affiliation==\nBefore the 1960s, when cultural changes lead to an incremental liberalization of the Democratic Party, Catholics were seen as staunch Democrats. The Democratic Party ran Al Smith, the first Catholic presidential candidate by a major party, in 1928, and, except when the ticket was headed by a [[Southern United States|Southern]] candidate, has nominated a Catholic for president or vice president in every election since 1960 except for [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] (where a [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Michael Dukakis]], was the presidential nominee).\n\nSince the 1960s, the Catholic vote has come to reflect the nation as a whole instead of being predominantly Democratic.{{r|silk20081103}} In the 60s and early 70s, a number of Catholics and Southern whites abandoned their traditional affiliation with the Democratic Party and began to support the Republican Party.  This shift is evidenced by the fact that Nixon received 33% of the Catholic vote in the 1968 election compared to 52% in 1972.  As a group, Catholics represented a quarter of the nation's electorate and were now one of the nation's largest swing groups.  Both parties began to aggressively woo the Catholic voters.  Although the Catholic hierarchy could not dictate who Catholics voted for, they did have a substantial influence over the faithful in their dioceses.  Politicians were aware that the bishops could direct significant time, energy and money to support the issues that were important to them.  From their perspective, the bishops were eager to regain some of the influence that their predecessors had wielded in the earlier part of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HeyerRozell2008_17\">{{cite book|last1=Heyer|first1=Kristin E.|last2=Rozell|first2=Mark J.|last3=Genovese|first3=Michael A.|title=Catholics and politics: the dynamic tension between faith and power|url=https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris|url-access=registration|accessdate=19 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-215-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris/page/17 17]}}</ref>  Since the 1970s non-Hispanic white Catholics have voted majority Republican very reliably while a majority of Hispanic or Latino Catholics have voted Democrat.<ref name=\"Religion, Race page 65-66\">Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 65-66</ref>\n\nIn his successful [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] campaign against [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]] won about half of the Catholic vote and a majority of Catholics who were non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 66</ref> \"[[Reagan Democrats]]\", many of them non-Hispanic white, blue-collar Catholics, comprised 25% of the Democrats who voted for Reagan, and formed an important part of his support in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] as well.

Although the majority of Catholics in 1984 remained Democrats, compared to 1980 Catholic votes switched to Reagan at about the same level as most Protestant groups. Reagan's vice president [[George H. W.

Many feared that he would answer to the pope and not the constitution.\nAnother major controversial issue was the continuation of [[Prohibition]]. Smith was personally in favor of relaxation or repeal of Prohibition laws despite its status as part of the nation's Constitution, but the Democratic Party split north and south on the issue.

Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John F. Kennedy]], 35th President of the United States]]\n\nReligion became a divisive issue during the [[1960 United States presidential election|presidential campaign of 1960]]. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected president, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, he decided to try to put the issue to rest.\n\nTo address fears that his Roman Catholicism would influence his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters \u2014 and the Church does not speak for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|accessdate=2007-09-17|last=Kennedy|first=John F.|date=2002-06-18|website=American Rhetoric|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911175450/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|archivedate=2007-09-11}}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.\n\nEven so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an absolute [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.\n\nKennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  There was a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more votes than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>''New York Times'', November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Catholics rallied to Kennedy as an affirmation of their religion and their right to have a Catholic president.\n\n==Representation in government==\n\n===Congress===\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Catholics represent 30.5% of [[Demographics of the United States Congress|the United States Congress]] as of January 2019. There are 141 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] and 22 [[United States Senate|Senators]] that are Catholic, which split as 99 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 64 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nOn January 4, 2007, [[Nancy Pelosi]], a Catholic, became the first woman elected as the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. She was elected again as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] on January 3, 2019, after serving as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] from 2003-2007 and 2011\u20132019. [[Paul Ryan]] is Catholic as well and served recently as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] from 2015 to 2019.\n\n[[Edward Kavanagh]] was nationally noticed as the first [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] elected from New England. Kavanagh was elected as a [[Jacksonian Democrats|Jacksonian]] to the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1831, to March 3, 1835.\n\n===Supreme Court===\nIn the early 1980s, there was one Catholic justice.  This changed in the mid 1980s when President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]] to the court, both Catholic. The first President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] (a Catholic who at the time of his appointment was attending Episcopalian services, though he has since become an active Catholic) along with [[David Souter]], an Episcopalian. The second President [[George W. Bush]] appointed [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]], both Catholics. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Catholic [[Sonia Sotomayor]].  For the seven years beginning with the 2009 appointment of Sotomayor and ending with the 2016 death of Scalia, the Supreme Court had a Catholic majority of five justices, including Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nThe four Catholic Supreme Court justices nominated in recent decades have consistently stood as reliable votes for abortion restriction. In ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' (1989), ''[[City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health]]'' (1990), ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'' (1990), and ''[[Rust v.

His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946).

The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance.

[W]ithout the element of ''surprise'' the scenes become meaningless.

In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde. In ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n===Relationship with actors===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor= #E0E6F8\n |quote =&nbsp;...

They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea.

He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said 'That's not acting.

He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant and James Stewart both worked with Hitchcock four times,<ref>{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}</ref> and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Writing, storyboards and production===\nHitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.<ref>{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}</ref> He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:\n\n{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|title=Hitchcock: \"Never mess about with a dead body\u2014you may be one&nbsp;....|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 December 1969}}</ref>}}\n\nHitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.<ref>Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{Citation|last=Pallant|first=Chris|title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding|year=2015|work=Storyboarding: A Critical History|pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris|series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6|isbn=978-1-137-02760-3|last2=Price|first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]\nThis view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. \n\nAccording to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O.

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank.

They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea. His actors are made of paper; when he doesn't like them, he can tear them up.\"{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}}} During the filming of ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941), [[Carole Lombard]] brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise him.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}\n\nHitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said 'That's not acting.

He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant and James Stewart both worked with Hitchcock four times,<ref>{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}</ref> and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Writing, storyboards and production===\nHitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.<ref>{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}</ref> He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:\n\n{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|title=Hitchcock: \"Never mess about with a dead body\u2014you may be one&nbsp;....|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 December 1969}}</ref>}}\n\nHitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.<ref>Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{Citation|last=Pallant|first=Chris|title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding|year=2015|work=Storyboarding: A Critical History|pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris|series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6|isbn=978-1-137-02760-3|last2=Price|first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]\nThis view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. \n\nAccording to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

''Maia'' is the name of a fictional family, although some episodes fit into the history of the real Maia family.\n\nAs early as 1878, while serving in the Portuguese consulate at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], E\u00e7a had at least given a name to this book and had begun working on it. It was mainly written during his residence in [[Bristol]], and it was first published in [[1888 in literature|1888]].\n\nThe book largely concerns the life of young [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] Carlos da Maia in 1870s Portugal, when along with his best friend Jo\u00e3o da Ega he spends his time making witticisms about society and having [[adultery|affairs]]. The novel uses the Monarchy's decline in Portugal (late 19th century), as a predominant theme, reflecting its author's own regret at his country's slow decay.\n\nThe analysis of the book is compulsory for [[Education in Portugal|year 11]] students in Portugal.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe book begins with the characters Carlos Eduardo da Maia, Jo\u00e3o da Ega, Afonso da Maia and Vila\u00e7a in the family's old house with plans to reconstruct it. The house, nicknamed \"Ramalhete\" (bouquet), is located in Lisbon. Its name comes from a tiled panel depicting a bouquet of sunflowers set on the place where the stone with the coat of arms should be. As the introductory scene goes on, the story of the Maia family is given, in a flashback style by Afonso.\n\nAfonso da Maia, a Portuguese well-mannered man, is married to Maria Eduarda Runa and their marriage only produces one son \u2013 Pedro da Maia. Pedro da Maia, who is given the typical romantic education, becomes a weak, low-spirited and sensitive man. He is very close to his mother and is inconsolable after her death. He only recuperates when he meets a beautiful woman called Maria Monforte with whom he gets married despite his father's objection. The marriage produces a son, Carlos Eduardo, and a daughter, whose name is not revealed until much later. Some time later, Maria Monforte falls in love with Tancredo (an Italian who is staying at their house after being accidentally wounded by Pedro) and runs away to Italy with him, betraying Pedro and taking her daughter along. When Pedro finds out, he is heartbroken and goes with his son to his father's house where he, during the night, commits suicide. Carlos stays at his grandfather's house and is educated by him, receiving the typical British education (as Afonso would have liked to have raised his son).\n\nNow back to the present, Carlos is a wealthy, elegant gentleman who is a doctor and opens his own office. Later he meets a gorgeous woman at the Hotel Central during a dinner organized by Jo\u00e3o da Ega (his friend and accomplice from University who lives with Carlos) in honor of Baron Cohen, the director of the National Bank. After many comical and disastrous adventures he finally discovers the woman's name \u2013 Maria Eduarda, and ends up meeting her. The two fall in love and have dozens of nights together, drinking and having sex. However, the two start seeing each other in secret after an incident where a redneck-like man named D\u00e2maso, Carlo's ex-friend and rival, writes an article in a newspaper, accusing, humiliating, making fun of and revealing the past of Carlos and Maria. Eventually Carlos finds out that Maria lied to him about her past and he starts fearing the worst. Mr. Guimar\u00e3es, a good friend of Maria's mother and an uncle-like figure to her, talks to Ega and gives him a box meant to be given \"to your friend Carlos... or to his sister!\". Ega doesn't understand this statement, because Carlos supposedly never had a sister. Ega is horrified and in state of shock when he realizes that Maria is Carlos's sister. Ega, in despair, tells everything to Vila\u00e7a (the Maia family attorney) who informs Carlos about the incest. Carlos informs his dying grandfather, and Afonso becomes shocked by this news. However, Carlos cannot forget his love and doesn't say anything to Maria. Afonso dies because of apoplexy. At last, Carlos informs his newfound sister that they are siblings and that they cannot live like this anymore. Maria says one last goodbye to her former lover and to her friends before going away to an unknown future. Carlos, to forget his tragedies, goes on a trip around the world.\n\nThe book ends with a famous scene in Portugal, where Carlos returns to Lisbon 10 years after he left. He meets Ega and combie a boys-only night to have fun together. At one point, they agree that there is nothing in the world that is worth running for. Ironically, as soon as they go out to the street, they realize that they missed the last cable car and they start running after it, shouting \"We can still catch it, we can still catch it...!\", closing the story in a both philosophical and comic way.\n\n==Translations==\nThe first English translation, by Patricia McGowan Pinheiro and Ann Stevens was published in 1965 by St. Martins Press. In 2007 [[Dedalus Books]] published a new English translation by [[Margaret Jull Costa]] which won the 2008 [[Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize]].\n\n==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==\nIn 2001 [[Rede Globo]] produced their acclaimed adaptation of ''Os Maias'' (including some elements from E\u00e7a's short novel ''[[The Relic (novel)|The Relic]]'') as a short soap-opera type serial in 40 chapters, which was shown from Tuesday to Friday during a ten-week period. It starred a very select group of Brazilian actors, most of them with long careers on TV, theatre and cinema. The screenplay was adapted by the renowned [[soap opera]] writer [[Maria Adelaide Amaral]] and directed by [[Luiz Fernando Carvalho]]. This is considered one of the most outstanding Globo productions in terms of photographic and overall artistic quality, but failed miserably, with low television ratings (often lower than a 9% audience share)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos/qtv140220017.htm|title=Observatorio da Imprensa - Materias - 07/02/2001|website=www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>.\n\n==Other adaptations==\n[[Paula Rego]] painted a series of pastels, inspired by this novel, which have been exhibited in London.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n{{wikisourcelang|pt|Os Maias}}\n\n{{Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maias, Os}}\n[[Category:1888 novels]]\n[[Category:Portuguese-language novels]]\n[[Category:Portuguese novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in the 1870s]]\n[[Category:Novels by Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queiroz]]\n[[Category:Incest in fiction]]\n[[Category:Family saga novels]]\n[[Category:Portuguese novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2008}}\n{{infobox book | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = The Maias\n| title_orig    = Os Maias\n| translator    = Patricia McGowen Pinheiro<br>Ann Stevens\n| image         = Os Maias Book Cover.jpg\n| caption = Cover of volume 1 in the first edition (1888)\n| author        = [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queiroz]]\n| illustrator   = \n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = Portugal\n| language      = Portuguese\n| series        = \n| genre         = \n| publisher     = Livraria Internacional de Ernesto Chardron, Lugan e Genelioux\n| release_date  = [[1888 in literature|1888]]\n| english_release_date = [[1965 in literature|1965]]\n| media_type    = Print\n| pages         = 990<br>458pp (Vol. 1)<br>532pp (Vol. 2)\n| isbn          = \n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   = \n}}\n'''''Os Maias: Epis\u00f3dios da Vida Rom\u00e2ntica''''' (\"The Maias: Episodes of Romantic Life\") is a [[literary realism|realist]] novel by Portuguese author [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queiroz]], also known under the modernized spelling E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s.
