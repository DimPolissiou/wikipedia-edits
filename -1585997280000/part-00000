John Brown''''' was a criminal trial held in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town, Virginia]], in October of 1859. The [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was prosecuted for his involvement in a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid]] on the United States federal [[arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. (Since 1863, both Charles Town and Harpers Ferry are in [[History of West Virginia|West Virginia]].) On October 16\u201318, 1859, Brown led 21 armed men, 5 blacks and 16 white, to Harpers Ferry, an important [[railroad junction]]. His goal was to seize the federal arsenal there and then lead a slave insurrection across the South. Brown and his men engaged in a two-day standoff with local militia and federal troops, in which ten of his men were shot or killed, five were captured, and five escaped.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2940.html\n|title=Africans in America\n|chapter=The raid on Harpers Ferry\n|publisher=[[PBS]]\n|author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]\n|year=1998}}</ref> Brown was captured and put on trial in a Virginia state court for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts, and hanged on December 2.\n\nThanks to the recently-invented [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], Brown's trial was the first to be reported nationally. Considering its aftermath, it was arguably the most important criminal trial in the history of the country, for it was closely related to the war that quickly followed. More than Brown's raid, his trial determined the fate of the Union. According to Brian McGinty, the \"Brown of history\" was thus born in his trial. Had Brown died before his trial, he would have been \"condemned as a madman and relegated to a footnote of history\". Robert McGlone added that \"the trial did magnify and exalt his image. But Brown's own efforts to fashion his ultimate public persona began long before the raid and culminated only in the weeks that followed his dramatic speech at his sentencing.\"<ref name=McGlone>{{cite article\n|title=Retrying John Brown: Was Virginia Justice \"Fair\"?\n|first=Robert E.\n|last=McGlone\n|magazine=[[Reviews in American History]]\n|volume=3\n|number=2\n|pages=292-298\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/441179}}</ref> After the sentencing, Brown, glad for the publicity, gave interviews to anyone who wanted to talk to him.\n\n==Trial==\n===Venue===\nBrown did not face federal charges. There were no federal court facilities nearby, and transporting the injured Brown and the other defendants to a large city and maintaining them there would have been difficult and expensive. And what would this gain? Murder was not a federal crime, and a federal indictment for treason or fomenting slave insurrection would have caused a political crisis (because so many abolitionists would have denounced it). Under Virginia law, fomenting a slave insurrection was clearly and unequivocally a crime. And the defendants could be tried where they were, in Charles Town. \"[[President Buchanan]] was indifferent to where Brown and his men were tried. ...Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise|Henry Wise]], on the other hand, was 'adamant' that the insurgents pay for their crimes through his state's judicial system.\"<ref name=McGlone/>{{rp|292}}\n\nThe trial, then, took place in the county courthouse in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], not to be confused with [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the state capital. Charles Town is the county seat of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County, Virginia]], about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Harpers Ferry. Since 1863 Jefferson County, including Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, is in West Virginia.\n\nA \"large armed force\" was stationed at Charles Town \"to prevent attempts at rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|295}} Brown was brought into court \"accompanied by a body of armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an armed guard were {{sic}} patrolling round the jail.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Grand jury===\nBrown faced a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on Tuesday, October 25, 1859, just eight days after his capture in the armory. The grand jury was also considering the other prisoners to be tried with Brown: [[Aaron Dwight Stevens|Aaron Stephens]], [[Barclay Coppock|Edwin Coppie]], [[Shields Green]], and [[John Anthony Copeland Jr.|John Copland]]. At 5 PM the grand jury reported they had not yet finished questioning of witnesses, and the hearing was adjourned until the next day.  On October 26 the grand jury returned a true [[bill of indictment]] against Brown and the other defendants, charging them with:\n* \"Conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection\",\n* [[Treason laws in the United States|Treason]] against the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of Virginia, and\n* Murder.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|298}}\n[[File:Trial of John Brown.jpg|thumb|350px|Trial of John Brown]]\n\n===Counsel===\nThe next question was what legal counsel Brown was to have. The Court assigned two \"Virginians and pro-slavery men\", John Faulkner and Lawson Botts, as counsel for him and the other accused. Brown did not accept them; he told the judge that he had sent for counsel, \"who have not had time to reach here\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|293}}\n\n{{quote|I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared. The Governor of the State of Virginia tendered me assurances that I should have a fair trial, but under no circumstances whatever will I be able to have a fair trial.

Brown stated that he did not wish to use an insanity defense, as had been proposed to him.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|309}} A court-appointed lawyer said that a Virginia court could only try Brown for acts committed in Virginia, not in Maryland or the federal arsenal. State counsel denied this was relevant.\n\nBrown, having received by telegraph news from a lawyer in Ohio, asked for a delay of one day; this was denied. The state attorney said that Brown's real motive was \"to give to his friends the time and opportunity to organize a rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|310}}\n\nOn Friday, October 28, \"Mr. Hoyt, a young Boston lawyer, arrived as a volunteer counsel for John Brown\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|317}}\n\n====Prosecution====\nThe prosecuting attorney was [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]].\n\nThe central prosecution witness in the trial was Colonel [[Lewis Washington]], of [[George Washington|President Washington]]'s family, who had been kidnapped out of his home and held hostage near the Federal Armory. His slaves were militarily \"[[impressment|impressed]]\" ([[conscription in the United States|conscripted]]) by Brown, but they took no active part in the insurrection. Other local witnesses testified to the seizure of the Federal Armory, the appearance of Virginia militia groups, and shootings on the railroad bridge. Other evidence described the U.S. Marines' raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad engine house occupied by Brown and his men. U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and cavalry officer [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led the Marine raid, and it freed the hostages and ended the standoff. Lee did not appear at the trial to testify, but instead filed an affidavit to the court with his account of the Marines raid.\n\nThe manuscript evidence was of particular interest to the judge and jury. Many documents were found on the Maryland farm rented by John Brown under the alias Isaac Smith. These included a [[Provisional Constitution]] for a new state, which Brown and his officers had signed. These documents clinched the treason and pre-meditated murder charges against Brown. The defense called no witnesses, and Brown himself did not testify.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its examination of witnesses. The defense called witnesses, but they did not appear as subpoenas had not been served on them. Mr. Hoyt said that other counsel for Brown would arrive that evening. Both court-appointed attorneys then resigned, and the trial was adjourned until the next day.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|323}}\n\n====Defense====\nThe trial resumed on Saturday, October 29. Two lawyers for Brown appeared, one from Washington and the other from Ohio. They asked for a few hours to read the indictment and the testimony so far given; thus was denied.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|325\u2013326}} The defense called six witnesses.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|326\u2013328}}\n\n\n [[George Henry Hoyt|George H. Hoyt]], another prominent lawyer, arrived a few days later from Massachusetts and took a hesitant role in the closing days of the trial. Hoyt was hired to defend Brown by John W. Le Barnes, one of the abolitionists who had given money to Brown in the past. Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., was also brought in as Brown's legal counsel.  Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, arrived late in the trial on October 31 and delivered the defense's closing argument.\n\nThe defense claimed that the Harpers Ferry Federal Armory was not on Virginia property, but since the murdered townspeople had died in the streets outside the perimeter of the Federal facility, this carried little weight with the jury. John Brown's lack of official citizenship in Virginia was presented as a defense against treason against the State. Judge Parker dispatched this claim by reference to \"rights and responsibilities\" and the overlapping citizenship requirements between the Federal union and the various states. John Brown, an American citizen, could be found guilty of treason against Virginia on the basis of his temporary residence there during the days of the insurrection.\n\nThree other substantive defense tactics failed. One claimed that since the insurrection was aimed at the U.S. government it could not be proved treason against Virginia. Since Brown and his men had fired upon Virginia troops and police, this point was mooted. His lawyers also said that since no slaves had joined the insurrection, the charge of leading a slave insurrection should be thrown out. The jury apparently did not favor this claim, either.\n\nExtenuating circumstances were claimed by the defense when they stressed that Colonel Washington and the other hostages were not harmed and were in fact protected by Brown during the siege. This claim was not persuasive as Colonel Washington testified that he had seen men die of gunshot wounds and had been confined for days.\n\nThe final plea by the defense team for mercy concerned the circumstances surrounding the death of two of John Brown's men, who were apparently fired upon and killed by the Virginia militia while under a flag of truce. The armed community surrounding the Federal Arsenal did not hold their fire when Brown's men emerged to parley. This incident is noticeable upon a close reading of the published testimony, but is generally neglected in more popular accounts. If the rebels under a flag of truce were fired upon, it did not appear to be a major issue to the biased judge and jury.\n\n===The verdict===\nThe prosecution began its closing argument on Friday, concluding on Monday, October 31.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|333}} The jury retired to consider its verdict.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|334\u2013336}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes. When it returned, according to the report in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', \"the only calm and unruffled countenance there\" was that of Brown. When the jury reported that it found him guilty of all charges, \"not the slightest sound was heard in the vast crowd\".<ref name=Liberator041159>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|title=The Harper's Ferry Tragedy.

He arose and made what his first biographer called \"[his] last speech\":<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340}}\n\n{{quote|I have, may it please the court, a few words to say.\n\nIn the first place, I deny everything but what I have all along admitted, the design on my part to free the slaves. I intended certainly to have made a clean thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into Missouri and there took slaves without the snapping of a gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left them in Canada. I designed to have done the same thing again, on a larger scale. That was all I intended. I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.\n\nI have another objection; and that is, it is unjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and which I admit has been fairly proved (for I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in this case), had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.\n\nThis court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the law of God. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=12}}}}. It teaches me, further, to \"remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them\" {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Hebrews|chapter=13|verse=3}}}}. I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe that to have interfered as I have done as I have always freely admitted I have done in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\n\nLet me say one word further.\n\nI feel entirely satisfied with the treatment I have received on my trial. Considering all the circumstances and animosity toward me, it has been fair and more generous than I expected. But I feel no consciousness of guilt. I have stated from the first [day] what was my intention and what was not. I never had any design against the life of any person, nor any disposition to commit treason, or excite slaves to rebel, or make any general insurrection. I never encouraged any man to do so, but always discouraged any idea of that kind.\n\nLet me say, also, a word in regard to the statements made by some of those connected with me. I hear it has been stated by some of them that I have induced them to join me. But the contrary is true. I do not say this to injure them, but as regretting their weakness. There is not one of them but joined me of his own accord, and the greater part of them at their own expense. A number of them I never saw, and never had a word of conversation with, till the day they came to me; and that was for the purpose I have stated.\n\nNow I have done.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}}}}\n\nThe judge sentenced him to death by hanging on December 2;<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}} under Virginia law a month had to separate the sentence of death and its execution. Governor Wise resisted subsequent pressures to move up Brown's execution because, he said, he did not want anyone saying that Brown's rights had not been fully respected.\n\nDuring the month between his conviction and his execution, Brown wrote many letters, most of which, and a few to him, were collected and published in 1860.<ref name=Redpath>{{cite book\n|title=The public life of Capt.

On the short trip from the jail to the gallows he was protected on both sides by lines of troups, to prevent an armed rescue. Spectators and reporters were kept far enough away that he could not talk to them, and he made no final statement from the gallows. His last known words are those on a note, passed to a jailor who asked for an autograph:\n\n<blockquote>Charlestown, Va. 2nd December, 1859.

On October 16\u201318, 1859, Brown led 21 armed men, 5 blacks and 16 white, to Harpers Ferry, an important [[railroad junction]]. His goal was to seize the federal arsenal there and then lead a slave insurrection across the South. Brown and his men engaged in a two-day standoff with local militia and federal troops, in which ten of his men were shot or killed, five were captured, and five escaped.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2940.html\n|title=Africans in America\n|chapter=The raid on Harpers Ferry\n|publisher=[[PBS]]\n|author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]\n|year=1998}}</ref> Brown was captured and put on trial in a Virginia state court for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts, and hanged on December 2.\n\nThanks to the recently-invented [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], Brown's trial was the first to be reported nationally. Considering its aftermath, it was arguably the most important criminal trial in the history of the country, for it was closely related to the war that quickly followed. More than Brown's raid, his trial determined the fate of the Union. According to Brian McGinty, the \"Brown of history\" was thus born in his trial. Had Brown died before his trial, he would have been \"condemned as a madman and relegated to a footnote of history\". Robert McGlone added that \"the trial did magnify and exalt his image. But Brown's own efforts to fashion his ultimate public persona began long before the raid and culminated only in the weeks that followed his dramatic speech at his sentencing.\"<ref name=McGlone>{{cite article\n|title=Retrying John Brown: Was Virginia Justice \"Fair\"?\n|first=Robert E.\n|last=McGlone\n|magazine=[[Reviews in American History]]\n|volume=3\n|number=2\n|pages=292-298\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/441179}}</ref> After the sentencing, Brown, glad for the publicity, gave interviews to anyone who wanted to talk to him.\n\n==Trial==\n===Venue===\nBrown did not face federal charges. There were no federal court facilities nearby, and transporting the injured Brown and the other defendants to a large city and maintaining them there would have been difficult and expensive. And what would this gain? Murder was not a federal crime, and a federal indictment for treason or fomenting slave insurrection would have caused a political crisis (because so many abolitionists would have denounced it). Under Virginia law, fomenting a slave insurrection was clearly and unequivocally a crime. And the defendants could be tried where they were, in Charles Town. \"[[President Buchanan]] was indifferent to where Brown and his men were tried. ...Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise|Henry Wise]], on the other hand, was 'adamant' that the insurgents pay for their crimes through his state's judicial system.\"<ref name=McGlone/>{{rp|292}}\n\nThe trial, then, took place in the county courthouse in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], not to be confused with [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the state capital. Charles Town is the county seat of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County, Virginia]], about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Harpers Ferry. Since 1863 Jefferson County, including Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, is in West Virginia.\n\nA \"large armed force\" was stationed at Charles Town \"to prevent attempts at rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|295}} Brown was brought into court \"accompanied by a body of armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an armed guard were {{sic}} patrolling round the jail.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Grand jury===\nBrown faced a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on Tuesday, October 25, 1859, just eight days after his capture in the armory. The grand jury was also considering the other prisoners to be tried with Brown: [[Aaron Dwight Stevens|Aaron Stephens]], [[Barclay Coppock|Edwin Coppie]], [[Shields Green]], and [[John Anthony Copeland Jr.|John Copland]]. At 5 PM the grand jury reported they had not yet finished questioning of witnesses, and the hearing was adjourned until the next day.  On October 26 the grand jury returned a true [[bill of indictment]] against Brown and the other defendants, charging them with:\n* \"Conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection\",\n* [[Treason laws in the United States|Treason]] against the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of Virginia, and\n* Murder.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|298}}\n[[File:Trial of John Brown.jpg|thumb|350px|Trial of John Brown]]\n\n===Counsel===\nThe next question was what legal counsel Brown was to have. The Court assigned two \"Virginians and pro-slavery men\", John Faulkner and Lawson Botts, as counsel for him and the other accused. Brown did not accept them; he told the judge that he had sent for counsel, \"who have not had time to reach here\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|293}}\n\n{{quote|I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared. The Governor of the State of Virginia tendered me assurances that I should have a fair trial, but under no circumstances whatever will I be able to have a fair trial.

Brown stated that he did not wish to use an insanity defense, as had been proposed to him.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|309}} A court-appointed lawyer said that a Virginia court could only try Brown for acts committed in Virginia, not in Maryland or the federal arsenal. State counsel denied this was relevant.\n\nBrown, having received by telegraph news from a lawyer in Ohio, asked for a delay of one day; this was denied. The state attorney said that Brown's real motive was \"to give to his friends the time and opportunity to organize a rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|310}}\n\nOn Friday, October 28, \"Mr. Hoyt, a young Boston lawyer, arrived as a volunteer counsel for John Brown\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|317}}\n\n====Prosecution====\nThe prosecuting attorney was [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]].\n\nThe central prosecution witness in the trial was Colonel [[Lewis Washington]], of [[George Washington|President Washington]]'s family, who had been kidnapped out of his home and held hostage near the Federal Armory. His slaves were militarily \"[[impressment|impressed]]\" ([[conscription in the United States|conscripted]]) by Brown, but they took no active part in the insurrection. Other local witnesses testified to the seizure of the Federal Armory, the appearance of Virginia militia groups, and shootings on the railroad bridge. Other evidence described the U.S. Marines' raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad engine house occupied by Brown and his men. U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and cavalry officer [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led the Marine raid, and it freed the hostages and ended the standoff. Lee did not appear at the trial to testify, but instead filed an affidavit to the court with his account of the Marines raid.\n\nThe manuscript evidence was of particular interest to the judge and jury. Many documents were found on the Maryland farm rented by John Brown under the alias Isaac Smith. These included a [[Provisional Constitution]] for a new state, which Brown and his officers had signed. These documents clinched the treason and pre-meditated murder charges against Brown. The defense called no witnesses, and Brown himself did not testify.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its examination of witnesses. The defense called witnesses, but they did not appear as subpoenas had not been served on them. Mr. Hoyt said that other counsel for Brown would arrive that evening. Both court-appointed attorneys then resigned, and the trial was adjourned until the next day.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|323}}\n\n====Defense====\nThe trial resumed on Saturday, October 29. Two lawyers for Brown appeared, one from Washington and the other from Ohio. They asked for a few hours to read the indictment and the testimony so far given; thus was denied.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|325\u2013326}} The defense called six witnesses.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|326\u2013328}}\n\n\n [[George Henry Hoyt|George H. Hoyt]], another prominent lawyer, arrived a few days later from Massachusetts and took a hesitant role in the closing days of the trial. Hoyt was hired to defend Brown by John W. Le Barnes, one of the abolitionists who had given money to Brown in the past. Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., was also brought in as Brown's legal counsel.  Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, arrived late in the trial on October 31 and delivered the defense's closing argument.\n\nThe defense claimed that the Harpers Ferry Federal Armory was not on Virginia property, but since the murdered townspeople had died in the streets outside the perimeter of the Federal facility, this carried little weight with the jury. John Brown's lack of official citizenship in Virginia was presented as a defense against treason against the State. Judge Parker dispatched this claim by reference to \"rights and responsibilities\" and the overlapping citizenship requirements between the Federal union and the various states. John Brown, an American citizen, could be found guilty of treason against Virginia on the basis of his temporary residence there during the days of the insurrection.\n\nThree other substantive defense tactics failed. One claimed that since the insurrection was aimed at the U.S. government it could not be proved treason against Virginia. Since Brown and his men had fired upon Virginia troops and police, this point was mooted. His lawyers also said that since no slaves had joined the insurrection, the charge of leading a slave insurrection should be thrown out. The jury apparently did not favor this claim, either.\n\nExtenuating circumstances were claimed by the defense when they stressed that Colonel Washington and the other hostages were not harmed and were in fact protected by Brown during the siege. This claim was not persuasive as Colonel Washington testified that he had seen men die of gunshot wounds and had been confined for days.\n\nThe final plea by the defense team for mercy concerned the circumstances surrounding the death of two of John Brown's men, who were apparently fired upon and killed by the Virginia militia while under a flag of truce. The armed community surrounding the Federal Arsenal did not hold their fire when Brown's men emerged to parley. This incident is noticeable upon a close reading of the published testimony, but is generally neglected in more popular accounts. If the rebels under a flag of truce were fired upon, it did not appear to be a major issue to the biased judge and jury.\n\n===The verdict===\nThe prosecution began its closing argument on Friday, concluding on Monday, October 31.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|333}} The jury retired to consider its verdict.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|334\u2013336}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes. When it returned, according to the report in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', \"the only calm and unruffled countenance there\" was that of Brown. When the jury reported that it found him guilty of all charges, \"not the slightest sound was heard in the vast crowd\".<ref name=Liberator041159>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|title=The Harper's Ferry Tragedy.

He arose and made what his first biographer called \"[his] last speech\":<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340}}\n\n{{quote|I have, may it please the court, a few words to say.\n\nIn the first place, I deny everything but what I have all along admitted, the design on my part to free the slaves. I intended certainly to have made a clean thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into Missouri and there took slaves without the snapping of a gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left them in Canada. I designed to have done the same thing again, on a larger scale. That was all I intended. I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.\n\nI have another objection; and that is, it is unjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and which I admit has been fairly proved (for I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in this case), had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.\n\nThis court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the law of God. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=12}}}}. It teaches me, further, to \"remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them\" {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Hebrews|chapter=13|verse=3}}}}. I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe that to have interfered as I have done as I have always freely admitted I have done in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\n\nLet me say one word further.\n\nI feel entirely satisfied with the treatment I have received on my trial. Considering all the circumstances and animosity toward me, it has been fair and more generous than I expected. But I feel no consciousness of guilt. I have stated from the first [day] what was my intention and what was not. I never had any design against the life of any person, nor any disposition to commit treason, or excite slaves to rebel, or make any general insurrection. I never encouraged any man to do so, but always discouraged any idea of that kind.\n\nLet me say, also, a word in regard to the statements made by some of those connected with me. I hear it has been stated by some of them that I have induced them to join me. But the contrary is true. I do not say this to injure them, but as regretting their weakness. There is not one of them but joined me of his own accord, and the greater part of them at their own expense. A number of them I never saw, and never had a word of conversation with, till the day they came to me; and that was for the purpose I have stated.\n\nNow I have done.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}}}}\n\nThe judge sentenced him to death by hanging on December 2;<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}} under Virginia law a month had to separate the sentence of death and its execution. Governor Wise resisted subsequent pressures to move up Brown's execution because, he said, he did not want anyone saying that Brown's rights had not been fully respected.\n\nDuring the month between his conviction and his execution, Brown wrote many letters, most of which, and a few to him, were collected and published in 1860.<ref name=Redpath>{{cite book\n|title=The public life of Capt.

[[John Wilkes Booth]] and Thomas Jackson (the future [[Stonewall Jackson]]) were present, along with 2,000 Federal troops and militia. On the short trip from the jail to the gallows he was protected on both sides by lines of troups, to prevent an armed rescue. Spectators and reporters were kept far enough away that he could not talk to them, and he made no final statement from the gallows. His last known words are those on a note, passed to a jailor who asked for an autograph:\n\n<blockquote>Charlestown, Va. 2nd December, 1859.

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia and is known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours the Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One tooth possibly belonging to the genus was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Most of the aforementioned teeth were originally attributed to [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]]. A partial spinosaurid skeleton from the Khok Kruat Formation was described in 2007, but whether it belongs to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of its teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' has been placed within the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, thee flutes of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened them most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', with respect to their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occured in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that, compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

Though it may also be possible that spinosaurids already had a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] before the Middle Cretaceous, and thus preceding the breakup of Laurasia from Gondwana.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia and is known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours the Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One tooth possibly belonging to the genus was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species ''[[\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis|'''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''']]'', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Most of the aforementioned teeth were originally attributed to [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]]. A partial spinosaurid skeleton from the Khok Kruat Formation was described in 2007, but whether it belongs to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of its teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' has been placed within the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

The tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, thee flutes of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened them most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', with respect to their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed ''Siamosaurus'' in the Spinosauridae [[Family (biology)|family]], based on close similarities in dentition to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nMany palaeontologists have expressed skepticism towards Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of ''Siamosaurus'', given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have been time and again mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=2010-01-01|title=Spinosaurs before Stromer: early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/343/1/175|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=343|issue=1|pages=175\u2013188|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..175B|doi=10.1144/SP343.10|issn=0305-8719}}</ref> In view of this, the German palaeontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and colleagues in 2002 argued that there is not enough material to confidently identify ''Siamosaurus'' as a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sues|first=Hans-Dieter|last2=Frey|first2=Eberhard|last3=Martill|first3=David M.|last4=Scott|first4=Diane M.|date=2002-09-19|title=Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=535\u2013547|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0535:icasdt]2.0.co;2|issn=0272-4634}}</ref> In 2004, American palaeontologist [[Thomas Holtz]] and colleagues considered it a [[nomen dubium|''nomen dubium'']] (dubious name), stating that its teeth might instead belong to contemporaneous fish such as [[saurodontid]] or [[Ichthyodectidae|ichthyodectid]] [[Teleost|teleosts]].<ref name=\"HMC04\">Holtz Jr., T.R., Molnar, R.E., and Currie, P.J.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occured in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that, compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.
