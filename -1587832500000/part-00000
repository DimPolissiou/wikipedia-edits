Buenaventura composed the music for \"[[Pandanggo|Pandanggo sa Ilaw]]\".\n\n===Gong music===\nPhilippine gong music can be divided into two types: the flat gong commonly known as ''gangs\u00e0'' and played by the groups in the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera region]] and the bossed gongs played among the Islam and animist groups in the southern Philippines.\n\n[[Kulintang]] refers to a racked [[gong chime]] instrument played in the southern islands of the Philippines, along with its varied accompanying ensembles. Different groups have different ways of playing the ''kulintang''.  Two major groups seem to stand-out in ''kulintang'' music.  These are the Maguindanaon and the Maranaw.  The kulintang instrument itself could be traced to either the introduction of gongs to Southeast Asia from [[China]] before the 10th century CE, or more likely, to the introduction of bossed gong chimes from [[Java]] in the 15th century. Nevertheless, the kulintang ensemble is the most advanced form of ensemble music with origins in the [[History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)|precolonial epoch of Philippine history]], and is a living tradition in southern parts of the country.\n\nThe tradition of kulintang ensemble music itself is regional, predating the establishment of present-day Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. It transcends religion, with [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] Animist, and Christian ethnic groups in Borneo, Flores and Sulawesi playing ''kulintangan''; and Muslim groups playing the same genre of music in Mindanao, Palawan and the Sulu archipelago. It is distantly related to the ''[[gamelan]]'' ensembles of [[Java]] and [[Bali]], as well as the musical forms in Mainland Southeast Asia, mainly because of the usage for the same bossed racked gong chimes that play both melodic and percussive.\n\n== Hispanic-influenced music ==\n[[Spanish occupation of the Philippines|Spain]] ruled the Philippines for 333 years, and Hispanic influence in Filipino culture is ubiquitous. This influence can be easily seen in folk and traditional music, especially in the Tagalog and Visayan regions, where Spanish influence was greatest.\n\n==== Rondalla music ====\nThe ''[[Rondalla]]'' is a traditional string orchestra comprising two-string, [[mandolin]]-type instruments such as the [[banduria]] and [[La\u00fad|laud]]; a [[guitar]]; a [[double bass]]; and often a drum for percussion. The rondalla has its origins in the Iberian ''rondalla'' tradition, and is used to accompany several Hispanic-influenced song forms and dances.\n\n==== Harana and Kundiman ====\nThe [[Harana (serenade)|Harana]] and [[Kundiman]] are popular lyrical songs dating back to the Spanish period, and are customarily used in courtship rituals. The Harana is rooted in the [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]]-[[Music of Spain|Spanish]] tradition and based on the rhythmic patterns of the [[habanera (aria)|habanera]]. The Kundiman, meanwhile, has pre-colonial origins from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalophone]] parts of the country, uses a triple meter rhythm, and is characterised by beginning in a [[minor key]] and shifting to a major one in the second half.\n\nIn the 1920s, Harana and Kundiman became more mainstream after performers such as [[Atang de la Rama]], Jovita Fuentes, Conching Rosal, [[Sylvia La Torre]] and [[Ruben Tagalog]] introduced them to a wider audience.\n\n==== Tinikling ====\nThe Tinikling is a dance from Leyte which involves two individual performers hitting bamboo poles, using them to beat, tap, and slide on the ground, in co-ordination with one or more dancers who steps over and in between poles. This is one of the more iconic Philippine dances, and is similar to other Southeast Asian bamboo dances.\n\n==== Cari\u00f1osa ====\nThe [[Cari\u00f1osa]] (meaning \"loving\" or \"affectionate one\") is the national dance and is part of the Mar\u00eda Clara suite of Philippine folk dances. It is notable for use of the [[Fan (implement)|fan]] and [[handkerchief]] in amplifying romantic gestures expressed by the couple performing the traditional courtship dance. The dance is similar to the Mexican [[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]], and is related to the Kuracha, Amenudo and Kuradang dances in the Visayas and Mindanao Area.\n\n== Popular music (original Filipino music){{anchor|OPM}} ==\n'''Original Filipino music''', now more commonly termed '''original Pinoy music''' or '''OPM''', originally referred only to Philippine pop songs, particularly ballads, such as those popular after the collapse of its predecessor, the [[Manila sound]] of the late 1970s. Currently, OPM is used as a catch-all term for popular music composed and performed by Filipino musicians and singers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/circle/20120513/now_and_then_is_opm_going_extinct|title=Now and then: Is OPM going extinct?|last=Santos|first=Tomas U.|website=varsitarian.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>\n\nBetween the 1950s, 1960s, and before the 1970s came the emergence of [[Pilita Corrales]], [[Sylvia La Torre]], [[Diomedes Maturan]], [[Ric Manrique Jr.]], [[Ruben Tagalog]], [[Helen Gamboa]], [[Vilma Santos]], [[Edgar Mortiz]], [[Carmen Camacho]], among many others.\n\nIn the 1970s, popular artists were [[Nora Aunor]], [[Tirso Cruz III]], [[Eddie Peregrina]], [[Ramon Jacinto]], [[Victor Wood]], and [[Asin (band)|Asin]]. The more major commercial [[Pinoy pop|Philippine pop]] music artists were [[Claire dela Fuente]], [[Didith Reyes]], [[Rico Puno]], [[Ryan Cayabyab]], [[Basil Valdez]], [[Celeste Legaspi]], [[Hajji Alejandro]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Freddie Aguilar]], [[Imelda Papin]], [[Eva Eugenio]], [[Marco Sison]], [[Nonoy Zu\u00f1iga]], [[Leah Navarro]], [[Cinderella (Filipino band)|Cinderella]], [[Tillie Moreno]], [[Ric Segreto]], [[Janet Basco]], [[Boyfriends (Filipino band)|Boyfriends]], [[Hotdog (band)|Hotdog]], [[VST & Co.]], and many others.\n\nBetween the 1980s and the 1990s, OPM was led by artists such as [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Pops Fernandez]], [[APO Hiking Society]], [[Kuh Ledesma]], [[Jose Mari Chan]], [[Dingdong Avanzado]], [[Rodel Naval]], [[Janno Gibbs]], [[Ogie Alcasid]], [[Joey Albert]], [[Lilet]], [[Martin Nievera]], [[Manilyn Reynes]], [[Lea Salonga]], [[Kristina Paner]], [[Rachel Alejandro]], [[Raymond Lauchengco]], [[JoAnne Lorenzana]], [[Francis Magalona]], [[Sharon Cuneta]], [[Sheryl Cruz]], [[Keno (singer)|Keno]], [[Lou Bonnevie]], [[Zsa Zsa Padilla]] and [[Gary Valenciano]], among many others.\n\nIn the 1990s, famous artists included [[Eraserheads]], [[The Company (vocal group)|The Company]], [[April Boy Regino]], [[Smokey Mountain (band)|Smokey Mountain]], [[Rivermaya]], [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]], [[Agot Isidro]], [[Dessa (Filipino singer)|Dessa]], [[Isabel Granada]], [[Vina Morales]], [[Donna Cruz]], [[Jolina Magdangal]], [[Jessa Zaragoza]], [[Ariel Rivera]], [[South Border (band)|South Border]], [[Carol Banawa]], [[Yano]], [[Introvoys]], [[Afterimage (band)|AfterImage]], [[Side A]], [[Andrew E.]], [[Lani Misalucha]], [[Ella May Saison]], [[Joey Ayala]], [[Viktoria (singer)|Viktoria]], April Boys, Color It Red, [[Roselle Nava]] and [[Blakdyak]], among many others.\n\nIn the 2000s and the 2010s, leading OPM artists include [[Sarah Geronimo]], [[Julie Anne San Jose]], [[Angeline Quinto]], [[Aicelle Santos]], [[Gerald Santos]], [[Jonalyn Viray]], [[Rachelle Ann Go]], [[Christian Bautista]], [[Kitchie Nadal]], [[Barbie's Cradle]], [[Yasmien Kurdi]], [[Mitoy Yonting]], [[Moonstar88]], [[Aiza Seguerra]], [[Toni Gonzaga]], [[Richard Poon]], [[Nina Girado|Nina]], [[Yeng Constantino]], [[Piolo Pascual]], [[Jovit Baldivino]], [[KZ Tandingan]], [[Nyoy Volante]], [[Daniel Padilla]], [[Hale (band)|Hale]], [[Spongecola]], [[Jennylyn Mercado]], [[Kim Chiu]], [[Kisses Delavin]], [[Charice|Jake Zyrus]], [[Jed Madela]], [[Erik Santos]], [[Parokya Ni Edgar]], [[Maris Racal]], [[Loisa Andalio]], [[Kamikazee]], [[Richard Yap]], [[Sam Milby]], [[TNT Boys]], [[Abra (rapper)|Abra]], [[James Reid (actor)|James Reid]], [[Janine Berdin]], [[Sheryn Regis]] and [[Gloc-9]], among many others.\n\nUnderground bands emerged and along with them were their perceptions of idealism and self-expression. The famous lyricist of Circle's End, Geno Georsua landed on top as the melodramatic expressionist. Bassist Greg Soliman of UST Pendong grasps the title as the best bassist of underground music.\n\nFrom its origin, OPM had been centered in Manila, where Tagalog and English are the dominant languages. Other ethnolinguistic groups such as Visayan, Bikol and Kapampangan, who are making music in their native languages, are rarely breaking into the popular Filipino local music scene. But there are unusual cases include the [[Bisrock]] (Visayan rock music) song \"Charing\" by 1017, Davao-based band, and \"Porque\" by Maldita, a Zamboanga-based Chavacano band. A lot of compositions of Bisrock are contributed by bands such as Phylum and Missing Filemon. However, a band called Groupies' Panciteria that hails from Tacloban, a [[Winaray]]-speaking city, launched a free downloadable mp3 album on [[Soundclick.com]] in 2009 containing 13 Tagalog songs and only one very short song in the [[Cebuano language]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Groupies' Panciteria|url=http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=515145&content=music|accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref> \n\nFollowing suit are the Kapampangans. The debut music video of \"Oras\" (\"''Time''\") by Tarlac City-based Kapampangan band Mernuts penetrated MTV Pilipinas, making it the first ever Kapampangan music video to join the ranks of other mainstream Filipino music videos. ''RocKapampangan: The Birth of Philippine Kapampangan Rock'', an album of modern remakes of Kapampangan folk extemporaneous songs by various Kapampangan bands was also launched in February 2008, and was regularly played via Kapampangan cable channel Infomax-8 and via one of Central Luzon's biggest FM radio stations, GVFM 99.1. Inspired by what the locals call \"Kapampangan cultural renaissance\", Angeles City-born balladeer [[Ronnie Liang]] rendered Kapampangan translations of some of his popular songs such as \"Ayli\" (Kapampangan version of \"Ngiti\"), and \"Ika\" (Kapampangan version of \"Ikaw\") for his repackaged album.\n\nDespite the growing clamor for non-Tagalog and non-English music and the greater representation of other [[Philippine languages]], the local Philippine music industry, which is centered in Manila, is unforthcoming in venturing investments to other locations. Some of their major reasons include the language barrier, small market size, and socio-cultural emphasis away from regionalism in the Philippines.  An example would be the songs of the Ilokano group \"The Bukros Singers,\"<ref>http://www.alphamusic.ph/artist/fa_regional_dialects/The-Best-Of-Ilocano-Songs-Volume-1.html</ref> who swept through Ilocandia in the 1990s and became a precursor for other Ilokano performers into the 2000s, but rarely broke through other music markets in the Philippines.\n\nThe country's first songwriting competition, [[Metro Manila Popular Music Festival]], was first established in 1977 and launched by the Popular Music Foundation of the Philippines. The event featured many prominent singers and songwriters during its time. It was held annually for seven years until its discontinuation in 1985. It was later revived in 1996 as the \"Metropop Song Festival\", running for another seven years before being discontinued in 2003 due to the decline of its popularity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-7436-0|edition=1. publ.|editor=John Shepherd|page=210|quote=This annual songwriting competition was geared toward discovering new Filipino talent in popular music, and produced a rich repertoire of Filipino music&nbsp;...}}</ref> Another variation of the festival had been established called the [[Himig Handog]] contest which began in 2000, operated by [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and its subsidiary music label [[Star Records]].  Five competitions have been held so far starting in 2000 to 2003 and was eventually revived in 2013. Unlike its predecessors, the contest has different themes which reflect the type of song entries chosen as finalists each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Himig Handog|url=http://himighandog.abs-cbn.com/index.html|publisher=[[Himig Handog]]|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Policarpio|first=Allan|title=Director-composer wins Himig Handog|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/82603/director-composer-wins-himig-handog|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref> In 2012, the [[Philippine Popular Music Festival]] was launched and is said to be inspired by the first songwriting competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philpop.com.ph/#aboutus|title=Philpop: About Us|publisher=Philpop MusicFest Foundation|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>  Another songwriting competition for OPM music being held annually is the Bombo Music Festival, being conducted by the radio network [[Bombo Radyo]], first conceived in 1985.<ref>https://bmf.bomboradyo.com/about/</ref>\n\n=== Pop music ===\n{{See also|Pinoy pop}}\n\nOPM pop has been regularly showcased in the live band scene. Groups such as [[Neocolours]], [[Side A (band)|Side A]], [[Introvoys]], [[The Teeth (Filipino band)|The Teeth]], [[Yano]], [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], Passage and [[Freestyle (Philippine band)|Freestyle]] popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop.\n\nIn the new millennium up to the 2010s, famous Filipino pop music artists included [[Sarah Geronimo]], [[Erik Santos]], [[Yeng Constantino]], and [[Regine Velasquez]], among many others.\n\n=== Choir music ===\n\nChoral music has become an important part of Philippine music culture. It dates back to the choirs of churches that sing during mass in the old days. In the middle of the 20th century, performing choral groups started to emerge and increasingly become popular as time goes by. Aside from churches, universities, schools and local communities have established choirs.\n\nPhilippine choral arrangers like Robert Delgado, Fidel Calalang, Lucio San Pedro, Eudenice Palaruan among others have included in the vast repertoires of choirs beautiful arrangements of OPM, folk songs, patriotic songs, novelty songs, love songs, and even foreign songs.\n\nThe [[Philippine Madrigal Singers]] (originally the University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers) is one of the most famous choral groups not only in the Philippines, but also worldwide. Winning international competitions, the group became one of the most formidable choral groups in the country. Other award-winning choral groups are the [[University of Santo Tomas Singers]], the Philippine Meistersingers (Former Adventist University of the Philippines Ambassadors), the U.P. Singing Ambassadors and U.P. Concert Chorus, among others.\n\n=== Rock music ===\n{{see also|Pinoy rock}}\n\nThe [[United States]] occupied the Islands from 1898 until 1946, and introduced American [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[rock & roll]] which became popular. In the late 1950s, native performers adapted Tagalog lyrics for North American rock & roll music, resulting in the seminal origins of Philippine rock. The most notable achievement in Philippine rock of the 1960s was the hit song \"Killer Joe\", which propelled the group [[The Rocky Fellers|Rocky Fellers]], reaching number 16 on the American radio charts.\n\n====1970s====\nUp until the 1970s, popular rock musicians began writing and producing in English. In the early 1970s, rock music began to be written using local languages, with bands like the [[Juan de la Cruz Band|Juan Dela Cruz Band]] being among the first popular bands to do so. Mixing Tagalog and English lyrics were also popularly used within the same song, in songs like \"Ang Miss Universe Ng Buhay Ko (\"''The Miss Universe of My Life''\") by the band [[Hotdog (band)|Hotdog]] which helped innovate the [[Manila Sound]]. The mixing of the two languages (known as \"Taglish\"), while common in casual speech in the Philippines, was seen as a bold move, but the success of Taglish in popular songs, including [[Sharon Cuneta]]'s first hit, \"Mr. DJ\", broke the barrier forevermore.\n\nPhilippine rock musicians added [[folk music]] and other influences, helping to lead to the 1978 breakthrough success of [[Freddie Aguilar]]. Aguilar's \"[[Anak (song)|Anak]]\" (\"''Child''\"), his debut recording, is the most commercially successful Filipino recording, and was popular throughout Asia and Europe, and has been translated into numerous languages by singers worldwide. [[Asin (band)|Asin]] also broke into the music scene in the same period, and were popular. Other similar artists included [[Sampaguita (singer)|Sampaguita]], Coritha, [[Florante]], [[Mike Hanopol]], and [[Heber Bartolome]].\n\n====1980s====\n[[Folk rock]] became the Philippine protest music of the 1980s, and Aguilar's \"[[Bayan Ko]]\" (\"''My Country''\") became popular as an [[anthem]] during the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]]. At the same time, a counterculture rejected the rise of politically focused lyrics. In [[Metro Manila|Manila]], a [[punk rock]] scene developed, led by bands like Betrayed, [[The Jerks]], Urban Bandits, and Contras. The influence of [[New wave music|new wave]] was also felt during these years, spearheaded by [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]].\n\n====1990s====\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of [[Eraserheads]], considered by many Philippine nationals as the number one group in the Philippine recording scene. In the wake of their success was the emergence of a string of influential Filipino rock bands such as [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], [[Yano]], Siakol, [[Teeth (Filipino band)|Teeth]], [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and [[Rivermaya]], each of which mixes the influence of a variety of rock subgenres into their style.<ref>[[Pinoy rock]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}} 90's [[Death metal]] emergence (Skychurch, Genital Grinder, Death After Birth, Apostate, Disinterment, Kabaong ni Kamatayan, Thanatopsy, Exhumed, Rumblebelly, Brimstone In Fire, [[Disinterment (band)|Disinterment]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ylBOSOBazZmSxkYpax0HF?fo=1 | title=Disinterment: Manila Death Metal Band | publisher= Spotify Technology S.A., headquartered in Luxembourg.

One big event is the [[Pulp Summer Slam]] wherein local rock/metal bands and international bands such as [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Death Angel]] and [[Arch Enemy]] have performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/47409/metal-bliss|title=Metal bliss|last=Santos|first=Kevin L.|website=lifestyle.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref> Another all-local annual event, [[Rakrakan Festival]], where over 100 Pinoy rock acts performed.\n\nThe neo-traditional genre in Filipino music is also gaining popularity, with artists such as [[Joey Ayala]], [[Grace Nono]], [[Bayang Barrios]] and [[Pinikpikan]] reaping relative commercial success while utilizing the traditional musical sounds of many indigenous tribes in the Philippines.\n\n=== Hip-hop ===\n\n{{Main|Pinoy hip hop}}\n\nFilipino hip-hop is [[hip hop music]] performed by musicians of Filipino descent, both in the Philippines and overseas, especially by Filipino-Americans. The Philippines is known to have had the first hip-hop music scene in Asia since the early 1980s, largely due to the country's historical connections with the United States where hip-hop originated. Rap music released in the Philippines has appeared in different languages such as Tagalog, Chavacano, Cebuano, Ilocano and English. In the Philippines, [[Francis Magalona|Francis M]], [[Gloc-9]] and [[Andrew E.]] are cited as the most influential rappers in the country, being the first to release mainstream rap albums.\n\nOther rappers like [[Dello (rapper)|Dello]], [[Abra (rapper)|Abra]], [[Ex Battalion]] and [[Shanti Dope]] uses songwriting as a way to tell stories.\n\n=== Other genres ===\nA number of other genres are growing in popularity in the Philippine music scene, including a number of alternative groups and tribal bands promoting cultural awareness of the Philippine Islands.\n\n====Jazz====\nLikewise, [[jazz]] has experienced a resurgence in popularity. Initial impetus was provided by W.D.O.U.J.I. (Witch Doctors of Underground Jazz Improvisation) with their award-winning independent release \"Ground Zero\" distributed by the now defunct N/A Records in 2002 and the Tots Tolentino-led Buhay jazz quartet in the year before that. This opened up the way for later attempts most notable of which is the Filipino jazz supergroup [[Johnny Alegre Affinity]], releasing its eponymous debut album in 2005 under London-based [[Candid Records]]. Mon David has also made the rounds of the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] music circuit. Among the female performers, Mishka Adams has been the most prominent. A recent development is the fusion of [[spoken-word]] and jazz and also with rock, chiefly attributed to [[Radioactive Sago Project]]. Other notable names of late are Bob Aves with his ethno-infused jazz, The Jazz Volunteers and Akasha which have anchored the now legendary underground jazz jams at Freedom Bar for almost half of the 11 years of its existence. Today, underground jazz jams are now held in a bar called TAGO jazz bar which is located at Main Avenue, Cubao. Newer jazz groups emerged in the local jazz scene namely Swingster Syndicate pioneering in the [[post-bop]] and modern trad jazz, and Camerata Jazz known for their Filipino jazz arrangements and sound.\n\n====Novelty pop====\nPinoy [[novelty song]]s became popular in the 1970s up to the early 1980s. Popular novelty singers around this time were [[Reycard Duet]], [[Fred Panopio]] and [[Yoyoy Villame]]. Novelty pop acts in the 1990s and 2000s included [[Michael V.]], [[Bayani Agbayani]], Masculados, [[Vhong Navarro]], [[Sexbomb Girls]], [[Joey de Leon]] (\"Itaktak Mo\"), [[Viva Hot Babes]] and [[Willie Revillame]].\n\n====Latin genres====\n[[Bossa nova]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latino]] music has been popular since the 1970s. Performers like Annie Brazil were active in the 1970s, while more recently, [[Sitti]] has been earning rave reviews for her bossa nova covers of popular songs.\n\n====Reggae====\n{{main|Pinoy reggae}}\nWhile there has long been a flourishing underground [[reggae]] and [[ska]] scene, particularly in [[Baguio City]], it is only recently that the genres have been accepted in the mainstream. Acts like [[Brownman Revival]], [[Put3ska]], [[Roots Revival]] of Cebu and The Brown Outfit Bureau of [[Tarlac City]] have been instrumental in popularizing what is called \"Island Riddims\". There is also a burgeoning [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] revival, spearheaded by Juan Pablo Dream and a large indie pop scene.\n\n====Electronic music====\n[[Electronic music]] began in the mid-1990s in the Manila underground spearheaded by luminaries like Manolet Dario of the Consortium. In 2010, local artists started to create [[electropop]] songs themselves. As of now, most electronic songs are used in commercials. The only radio station so far that purely plays electronic music is [[DZUR|107.9 U Radio]]. The 2010s also began the rise of indie electronic producers, DJs and artists with the likes of [[Somedaydream]], Borhuh, Kidwolf, Zelijah, John Sedano, MVRXX, MRKIII, Bojam, CRWN, NINNO, Kidthrones, and Jess Connelly.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Rondalla]]\n* [[List of Philippine-based music groups]]\n* [[Manila Sound]]\n* [[Pinoy pop]]\n* [[Pinoy reggae]]\n* [[Pinoy rock]]\n* [[Pinoy hip hop]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Clewley, John. \"Pinoy Rockers\". 2000.

The compositions are often a mixture of different Asian, [[Music of Spain|Spanish]], [[Latin America]]n, American, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous]] influences.\n\n== Indigenous music ==\n{{Main|Filipino folk music}}\nNotable folk song composers include the National Artist for Music [[Lucio San Pedro]], who composed the famous \"[[Sa Ugoy ng Duyan]]\" that recalls about the loving touch of mother to her child. Another composer, the National Artist for Music [[Antonino Buenaventura]], is notable for notating folk songs and dances. Buenaventura composed the music for \"[[Pandanggo|Pandanggo sa Ilaw]]\".\n\n===Gong music===\nPhilippine gong music can be divided into two types: the flat gong commonly known as ''gangs\u00e0'' and played by the groups in the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera region]] and the bossed gongs played among the Islam and animist groups in the southern Philippines.\n\n[[Kulintang]] refers to a racked [[gong chime]] instrument played in the southern islands of the Philippines, along with its varied accompanying ensembles. Different groups have different ways of playing the ''kulintang''.  Two major groups seem to stand-out in ''kulintang'' music.  These are the Maguindanaon and the Maranaw.  The kulintang instrument itself could be traced to either the introduction of gongs to Southeast Asia from [[China]] before the 10th century CE, or more likely, to the introduction of bossed gong chimes from [[Java]] in the 15th century. Nevertheless, the kulintang ensemble is the most advanced form of ensemble music with origins in the [[History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)|precolonial epoch of Philippine history]], and is a living tradition in southern parts of the country.\n\nThe tradition of kulintang ensemble music itself is regional, predating the establishment of present-day Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. It transcends religion, with [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] Animist, and Christian ethnic groups in Borneo, Flores and Sulawesi playing ''kulintangan''; and Muslim groups playing the same genre of music in Mindanao, Palawan and the Sulu archipelago. It is distantly related to the ''[[gamelan]]'' ensembles of [[Java]] and [[Bali]], as well as the musical forms in Mainland Southeast Asia, mainly because of the usage for the same bossed racked gong chimes that play both melodic and percussive.\n\n== Hispanic-influenced music ==\n[[Spanish occupation of the Philippines|Spain]] ruled the Philippines for 333 years, and Hispanic influence in Filipino culture is ubiquitous. This influence can be easily seen in folk and traditional music, especially in the Tagalog and Visayan regions, where Spanish influence was greatest.\n\n==== Rondalla music ====\nThe ''[[Rondalla]]'' is a traditional string orchestra comprising two-string, [[mandolin]]-type instruments such as the [[banduria]] and [[La\u00fad|laud]]; a [[guitar]]; a [[double bass]]; and often a drum for percussion. The rondalla has its origins in the Iberian ''rondalla'' tradition, and is used to accompany several Hispanic-influenced song forms and dances.\n\n==== Harana and Kundiman ====\nThe [[Harana (serenade)|Harana]] and [[Kundiman]] are popular lyrical songs dating back to the Spanish period, and are customarily used in courtship rituals. The Harana is rooted in the [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]]-[[Music of Spain|Spanish]] tradition and based on the rhythmic patterns of the [[habanera (aria)|habanera]]. The Kundiman, meanwhile, has pre-colonial origins from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalophone]] parts of the country, uses a triple meter rhythm, and is characterised by beginning in a [[minor key]] and shifting to a major one in the second half.\n\nIn the 1920s, Harana and Kundiman became more mainstream after performers such as [[Atang de la Rama]], Jovita Fuentes, Conching Rosal, [[Sylvia La Torre]] and [[Ruben Tagalog]] introduced them to a wider audience.\n\n==== Tinikling ====\nThe Tinikling is a dance from Leyte which involves two individual performers hitting bamboo poles, using them to beat, tap, and slide on the ground, in co-ordination with one or more dancers who steps over and in between poles. This is one of the more iconic Philippine dances, and is similar to other Southeast Asian bamboo dances.\n\n==== Cari\u00f1osa ====\nThe [[Cari\u00f1osa]] (meaning \"loving\" or \"affectionate one\") is the national dance and is part of the Mar\u00eda Clara suite of Philippine folk dances. It is notable for use of the [[Fan (implement)|fan]] and [[handkerchief]] in amplifying romantic gestures expressed by the couple performing the traditional courtship dance. The dance is similar to the Mexican [[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]], and is related to the Kuracha, Amenudo and Kuradang dances in the Visayas and Mindanao Area.\n\n== Popular music (original Filipino music){{anchor|OPM}} ==\n'''Original Filipino music''', now more commonly termed '''original Pinoy music''' or '''OPM''', originally referred only to Philippine pop songs, particularly ballads, such as those popular after the collapse of its predecessor, the [[Manila sound]] of the late 1970s. Currently, OPM is used as a catch-all term for popular music composed and performed by Filipino musicians and singers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/circle/20120513/now_and_then_is_opm_going_extinct|title=Now and then: Is OPM going extinct?|last=Santos|first=Tomas U.|website=varsitarian.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>\n\nBetween the 1950s, 1960s, and before the 1970s came the emergence of [[Pilita Corrales]], [[Sylvia La Torre]], [[Diomedes Maturan]], [[Ric Manrique Jr.]], [[Ruben Tagalog]], [[Helen Gamboa]], [[Vilma Santos]], [[Edgar Mortiz]], [[Carmen Camacho]], among many others.\n\nIn the 1970s, popular artists were [[Nora Aunor]], [[Tirso Cruz III]], [[Eddie Peregrina]], [[Ramon Jacinto]], [[Victor Wood]], and [[Asin (band)|Asin]]. The more major commercial [[Pinoy pop|Philippine pop]] music artists were [[Claire dela Fuente]], [[Didith Reyes]], [[Rico Puno]], [[Ryan Cayabyab]], [[Basil Valdez]], [[Celeste Legaspi]], [[Hajji Alejandro]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Freddie Aguilar]], [[Imelda Papin]], [[Eva Eugenio]], [[Marco Sison]], [[Nonoy Zu\u00f1iga]], [[Leah Navarro]], [[Cinderella (Filipino band)|Cinderella]], [[Tillie Moreno]], [[Ric Segreto]], [[Janet Basco]], [[Boyfriends (Filipino band)|Boyfriends]], [[Hotdog (band)|Hotdog]], [[VST & Co.]], and many others.\n\nBetween the 1980s and the 1990s, OPM was led by artists such as [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Pops Fernandez]], [[APO Hiking Society]], [[Kuh Ledesma]], [[Jose Mari Chan]], [[Dingdong Avanzado]], [[Rodel Naval]], [[Janno Gibbs]], [[Ogie Alcasid]], [[Joey Albert]], [[Lilet]], [[Martin Nievera]], [[Manilyn Reynes]], [[Lea Salonga]], [[Kristina Paner]], [[Rachel Alejandro]], [[Raymond Lauchengco]], [[JoAnne Lorenzana]], [[Francis Magalona]], [[Sharon Cuneta]], [[Sheryl Cruz]], [[Keno (singer)|Keno]], [[Lou Bonnevie]], [[Zsa Zsa Padilla]] and [[Gary Valenciano]], among many others.\n\nIn the 1990s, famous artists included [[Eraserheads]], [[The Company (vocal group)|The Company]], [[April Boy Regino]], [[Smokey Mountain (band)|Smokey Mountain]], [[Rivermaya]], [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]], [[Agot Isidro]], [[Dessa (Filipino singer)|Dessa]], [[Isabel Granada]], [[Vina Morales]], [[Donna Cruz]], [[Jolina Magdangal]], [[Jessa Zaragoza]], [[Ariel Rivera]], [[South Border (band)|South Border]], [[Carol Banawa]], [[Yano]], [[Introvoys]], [[Afterimage (band)|AfterImage]], [[Side A]], [[Andrew E.]], [[Lani Misalucha]], [[Ella May Saison]], [[Joey Ayala]], [[Viktoria (singer)|Viktoria]], April Boys, Color It Red, [[Roselle Nava]] and [[Blakdyak]], among many others.\n\nIn the 2000s and the 2010s, leading OPM artists include [[Sarah Geronimo]], [[Julie Anne San Jose]], [[Angeline Quinto]], [[Aicelle Santos]], [[Gerald Santos]], [[Jonalyn Viray]], [[Rachelle Ann Go]], [[Christian Bautista]], [[Kitchie Nadal]], [[Barbie's Cradle]], [[Yasmien Kurdi]], [[Mitoy Yonting]], [[Moonstar88]], [[Aiza Seguerra]], [[Toni Gonzaga]], [[Richard Poon]], [[Nina Girado|Nina]], [[Yeng Constantino]], [[Piolo Pascual]], [[Jovit Baldivino]], [[KZ Tandingan]], [[Nyoy Volante]], [[Daniel Padilla]], [[Hale (band)|Hale]], [[Spongecola]], [[Jennylyn Mercado]], [[Kim Chiu]], [[Kisses Delavin]], [[Charice|Jake Zyrus]], [[Jed Madela]], [[Erik Santos]], [[Parokya Ni Edgar]], [[Maris Racal]], [[Loisa Andalio]], [[Kamikazee]], [[Richard Yap]], [[Sam Milby]], [[TNT Boys]], [[Abra (rapper)|Abra]], [[James Reid (actor)|James Reid]], [[Janine Berdin]], [[Sheryn Regis]] and [[Gloc-9]], among many others.\n\nUnderground bands emerged and along with them were their perceptions of idealism and self-expression. The famous lyricist of Circle's End, Geno Georsua landed on top as the melodramatic expressionist. Bassist Greg Soliman of UST Pendong grasps the title as the best bassist of underground music.\n\nFrom its origin, OPM had been centered in Manila, where Tagalog and English are the dominant languages. Other ethnolinguistic groups such as Visayan, Bikol and Kapampangan, who are making music in their native languages, are rarely breaking into the popular Filipino local music scene. But there are unusual cases include the [[Bisrock]] (Visayan rock music) song \"Charing\" by 1017, Davao-based band, and \"Porque\" by Maldita, a Zamboanga-based Chavacano band. A lot of compositions of Bisrock are contributed by bands such as Phylum and Missing Filemon. However, a band called Groupies' Panciteria that hails from Tacloban, a [[Winaray]]-speaking city, launched a free downloadable mp3 album on [[Soundclick.com]] in 2009 containing 13 Tagalog songs and only one very short song in the [[Cebuano language]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Groupies' Panciteria|url=http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=515145&content=music|accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref> \n\nFollowing suit are the Kapampangans. The debut music video of \"Oras\" (\"''Time''\") by Tarlac City-based Kapampangan band Mernuts penetrated MTV Pilipinas, making it the first ever Kapampangan music video to join the ranks of other mainstream Filipino music videos. ''RocKapampangan: The Birth of Philippine Kapampangan Rock'', an album of modern remakes of Kapampangan folk extemporaneous songs by various Kapampangan bands was also launched in February 2008, and was regularly played via Kapampangan cable channel Infomax-8 and via one of Central Luzon's biggest FM radio stations, GVFM 99.1. Inspired by what the locals call \"Kapampangan cultural renaissance\", Angeles City-born balladeer [[Ronnie Liang]] rendered Kapampangan translations of some of his popular songs such as \"Ayli\" (Kapampangan version of \"Ngiti\"), and \"Ika\" (Kapampangan version of \"Ikaw\") for his repackaged album.\n\nDespite the growing clamor for non-Tagalog and non-English music and the greater representation of other [[Philippine languages]], the local Philippine music industry, which is centered in Manila, is unforthcoming in venturing investments to other locations. Some of their major reasons include the language barrier, small market size, and socio-cultural emphasis away from regionalism in the Philippines.  An example would be the songs of the Ilokano group \"The Bukros Singers,\"<ref>http://www.alphamusic.ph/artist/fa_regional_dialects/The-Best-Of-Ilocano-Songs-Volume-1.html</ref> who swept through Ilocandia in the 1990s and became a precursor for other Ilokano performers into the 2000s, but rarely broke through other music markets in the Philippines.\n\nThe country's first songwriting competition, [[Metro Manila Popular Music Festival]], was first established in 1977 and launched by the Popular Music Foundation of the Philippines. The event featured many prominent singers and songwriters during its time. It was held annually for seven years until its discontinuation in 1985. It was later revived in 1996 as the \"Metropop Song Festival\", running for another seven years before being discontinued in 2003 due to the decline of its popularity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-7436-0|edition=1. publ.|editor=John Shepherd|page=210|quote=This annual songwriting competition was geared toward discovering new Filipino talent in popular music, and produced a rich repertoire of Filipino music&nbsp;...}}</ref> Another variation of the festival had been established called the [[Himig Handog]] contest which began in 2000, operated by [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and its subsidiary music label [[Star Records]].  Five competitions have been held so far starting in 2000 to 2003 and was eventually revived in 2013. Unlike its predecessors, the contest has different themes which reflect the type of song entries chosen as finalists each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Himig Handog|url=http://himighandog.abs-cbn.com/index.html|publisher=[[Himig Handog]]|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Policarpio|first=Allan|title=Director-composer wins Himig Handog|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/82603/director-composer-wins-himig-handog|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref> In 2012, the [[Philippine Popular Music Festival]] was launched and is said to be inspired by the first songwriting competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philpop.com.ph/#aboutus|title=Philpop: About Us|publisher=Philpop MusicFest Foundation|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>  Another songwriting competition for OPM music being held annually is the Bombo Music Festival, being conducted by the radio network [[Bombo Radyo]], first conceived in 1985.<ref>https://bmf.bomboradyo.com/about/</ref>\n\n=== Pop music ===\n{{See also|Pinoy pop}}\n\nOPM pop has been regularly showcased in the live band scene. Groups such as [[Neocolours]], [[Side A (band)|Side A]], [[Introvoys]], [[The Teeth (Filipino band)|The Teeth]], [[Yano]], [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], Passage and [[Freestyle (Philippine band)|Freestyle]] popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop.\n\nIn the new millennium up to the 2010s, famous Filipino pop music artists included [[Sarah Geronimo]], [[Erik Santos]], [[Yeng Constantino]], and [[Regine Velasquez]], among many others.\n\n=== Choir music ===\n\nChoral music has become an important part of Philippine music culture. It dates back to the choirs of churches that sing during mass in the old days. In the middle of the 20th century, performing choral groups started to emerge and increasingly become popular as time goes by. Aside from churches, universities, schools and local communities have established choirs.\n\nPhilippine choral arrangers like Robert Delgado, Fidel Calalang, Lucio San Pedro, Eudenice Palaruan among others have included in the vast repertoires of choirs beautiful arrangements of OPM, folk songs, patriotic songs, novelty songs, love songs, and even foreign songs.\n\nThe [[Philippine Madrigal Singers]] (originally the University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers) is one of the most famous choral groups not only in the Philippines, but also worldwide. Winning international competitions, the group became one of the most formidable choral groups in the country. Other award-winning choral groups are the [[University of Santo Tomas Singers]], the Philippine Meistersingers (Former Adventist University of the Philippines Ambassadors), the U.P. Singing Ambassadors and U.P. Concert Chorus, among others.\n\n=== Rock music ===\n{{see also|Pinoy rock}}\n\nThe [[United States]] occupied the Islands from 1898 until 1946, and introduced American [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[rock & roll]] which became popular. In the late 1950s, native performers adapted Tagalog lyrics for North American rock & roll music, resulting in the seminal origins of Philippine rock. The most notable achievement in Philippine rock of the 1960s was the hit song \"Killer Joe\", which propelled the group [[The Rocky Fellers|Rocky Fellers]], reaching number 16 on the American radio charts.\n\n====1970s====\nUp until the 1970s, popular rock musicians began writing and producing in English. In the early 1970s, rock music began to be written using local languages, with bands like the [[Juan de la Cruz Band|Juan Dela Cruz Band]] being among the first popular bands to do so. Mixing Tagalog and English lyrics were also popularly used within the same song, in songs like \"Ang Miss Universe Ng Buhay Ko (\"''The Miss Universe of My Life''\") by the band [[Hotdog (band)|Hotdog]] which helped innovate the [[Manila Sound]]. The mixing of the two languages (known as \"Taglish\"), while common in casual speech in the Philippines, was seen as a bold move, but the success of Taglish in popular songs, including [[Sharon Cuneta]]'s first hit, \"Mr. DJ\", broke the barrier forevermore.\n\nPhilippine rock musicians added [[folk music]] and other influences, helping to lead to the 1978 breakthrough success of [[Freddie Aguilar]]. Aguilar's \"[[Anak (song)|Anak]]\" (\"''Child''\"), his debut recording, is the most commercially successful Filipino recording, and was popular throughout Asia and Europe, and has been translated into numerous languages by singers worldwide. [[Asin (band)|Asin]] also broke into the music scene in the same period, and were popular. Other similar artists included [[Sampaguita (singer)|Sampaguita]], Coritha, [[Florante]], [[Mike Hanopol]], and [[Heber Bartolome]].\n\n====1980s====\n[[Folk rock]] became the Philippine protest music of the 1980s, and Aguilar's \"[[Bayan Ko]]\" (\"''My Country''\") became popular as an [[anthem]] during the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]]. At the same time, a counterculture rejected the rise of politically focused lyrics. In [[Metro Manila|Manila]], a [[punk rock]] scene developed, led by bands like Betrayed, [[The Jerks]], Urban Bandits, and Contras. The influence of [[New wave music|new wave]] was also felt during these years, spearheaded by [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]].\n\n====1990s====\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of [[Eraserheads]], considered by many Philippine nationals as the number one group in the Philippine recording scene. In the wake of their success was the emergence of a string of influential Filipino rock bands such as [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], [[Yano]], Siakol, [[Teeth (Filipino band)|Teeth]], [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and [[Rivermaya]], each of which mixes the influence of a variety of rock subgenres into their style.<ref>[[Pinoy rock]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}} 90's [[Death metal]] emergence (Skychurch, Genital Grinder, Death After Birth, Apostate, Disinterment, Kabaong ni Kamatayan, Thanatopsy, Exhumed, Rumblebelly, Brimstone In Fire, [[Disinterment (band)|Disinterment]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ylBOSOBazZmSxkYpax0HF?fo=1 | title=Disinterment: Manila Death Metal Band | publisher= Spotify Technology S.A., headquartered in Luxembourg.

One big event is the [[Pulp Summer Slam]] wherein local rock/metal bands and international bands such as [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Death Angel]] and [[Arch Enemy]] have performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/47409/metal-bliss|title=Metal bliss|last=Santos|first=Kevin L.|website=lifestyle.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref> Another all-local annual event, [[Rakrakan Festival]], where over 100 Pinoy rock acts performed.\n\nThe neo-traditional genre in Filipino music is also gaining popularity, with artists such as [[Joey Ayala]], [[Grace Nono]], [[Bayang Barrios]] and [[Pinikpikan]] reaping relative commercial success while utilizing the traditional musical sounds of many indigenous tribes in the Philippines.\n\n=== Hip-hop ===\n\n{{Main|Pinoy hip hop}}\n\nFilipino hip-hop is [[hip hop music]] performed by musicians of Filipino descent, both in the Philippines and overseas, especially by Filipino-Americans. The Philippines is known to have had the first hip-hop music scene in Asia since the early 1980s, largely due to the country's historical connections with the United States where hip-hop originated. Rap music released in the Philippines has appeared in different languages such as Tagalog, Chavacano, Cebuano, Ilocano and English. In the Philippines, [[Francis Magalona|Francis M]], [[Gloc-9]] and [[Andrew E.]] are cited as the most influential rappers in the country, being the first to release mainstream rap albums.\n\nOther rappers like [[Dello (rapper)|Dello]], [[Abra (rapper)|Abra]], [[Ex Battalion]] and [[Shanti Dope]] uses songwriting as a way to tell stories.\n\n=== Other genres ===\nA number of other genres are growing in popularity in the Philippine music scene, including a number of alternative groups and tribal bands promoting cultural awareness of the Philippine Islands.\n\n====Jazz====\nLikewise, [[jazz]] has experienced a resurgence in popularity. Initial impetus was provided by W.D.O.U.J.I. (Witch Doctors of Underground Jazz Improvisation) with their award-winning independent release \"Ground Zero\" distributed by the now defunct N/A Records in 2002 and the Tots Tolentino-led Buhay jazz quartet in the year before that. This opened up the way for later attempts most notable of which is the Filipino jazz supergroup [[Johnny Alegre Affinity]], releasing its eponymous debut album in 2005 under London-based [[Candid Records]]. Mon David has also made the rounds of the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] music circuit. Among the female performers, Mishka Adams has been the most prominent. A recent development is the fusion of [[spoken-word]] and jazz and also with rock, chiefly attributed to [[Radioactive Sago Project]]. Other notable names of late are Bob Aves with his ethno-infused jazz, The Jazz Volunteers and Akasha which have anchored the now legendary underground jazz jams at Freedom Bar for almost half of the 11 years of its existence. Today, underground jazz jams are now held in a bar called TAGO jazz bar which is located at Main Avenue, Cubao. Newer jazz groups emerged in the local jazz scene namely Swingster Syndicate pioneering in the [[post-bop]] and modern trad jazz, and Camerata Jazz known for their Filipino jazz arrangements and sound.\n\n====Novelty pop====\nPinoy [[novelty song]]s became popular in the 1970s up to the early 1980s. Popular novelty singers around this time were [[Reycard Duet]], [[Fred Panopio]] and [[Yoyoy Villame]]. Novelty pop acts in the 1990s and 2000s included [[Michael V.]], [[Bayani Agbayani]], Masculados, [[Vhong Navarro]], [[Sexbomb Girls]], [[Joey de Leon]] (\"Itaktak Mo\"), [[Viva Hot Babes]] and [[Willie Revillame]].\n\n====Latin genres====\n[[Bossa nova]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latino]] music has been popular since the 1970s. Performers like Annie Brazil were active in the 1970s, while more recently, [[Sitti]] has been earning rave reviews for her bossa nova covers of popular songs.\n\n====Reggae====\n{{main|Pinoy reggae}}\nWhile there has long been a flourishing underground [[reggae]] and [[ska]] scene, particularly in [[Baguio City]], it is only recently that the genres have been accepted in the mainstream. Acts like [[Brownman Revival]], [[Put3ska]], [[Roots Revival]] of Cebu and The Brown Outfit Bureau of [[Tarlac City]] have been instrumental in popularizing what is called \"Island Riddims\". There is also a burgeoning [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] revival, spearheaded by Juan Pablo Dream and a large indie pop scene.\n\n====Electronic music====\n[[Electronic music]] began in the mid-1990s in the Manila underground spearheaded by luminaries like Manolet Dario of the Consortium. In 2010, local artists started to create [[electropop]] songs themselves. As of now, most electronic songs are used in commercials. The only radio station so far that purely plays electronic music is [[DZUR|107.9 U Radio]]. The 2010s also began the rise of indie electronic producers, DJs and artists with the likes of [[Somedaydream]], Borhuh, Kidwolf, Zelijah, John Sedano, MVRXX, MRKIII, Bojam, CRWN, NINNO, Kidthrones, and Jess Connelly.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Rondalla]]\n* [[List of Philippine-based music groups]]\n* [[Manila Sound]]\n* [[Pinoy pop]]\n* [[Pinoy reggae]]\n* [[Pinoy rock]]\n* [[Pinoy hip hop]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Clewley, John. \"Pinoy Rockers\". 2000.

He also competed in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC).\n\n== Wrestling ==\nAskren was an assistant [[wrestling]] coach at [[Arizona State University]] and was an American [[collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]] for the [[University of Missouri]]. He is a two-time state champion in wrestling at [[Arrowhead High School]] in [[Hartland, Wisconsin]].<ref>http://wrestling.teamusa.org/athletes/ben-askren</ref>\n\n=== Collegiate wrestling ===\n\nIn college, he wrestled in the 174&nbsp;lb. [[weight class]]. He lost the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) championship match to [[Chris Pendleton]] in both 2004 and 2005 before winning it in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his pinning ability (he holds the single-season NCAA pin record); his massive afro; and his \"funky\", or unorthodox, wrestling style. For example, while being ridden in the 2005 championship match, he attempted to reach around and apply a [[headlock]] to Pendleton, a move that any wrestling coach would disavow. His tall, lanky body \u2014 in sharp contrast to the squat, muscular physiques of many top wrestlers \u2014 allows him to attempt moves that most wrestlers could not. This characteristic later led to a challenging transition to freestyle wrestling early in his career, as the freestyle rules differ from folkstyle wrestling and penalize a wrestler for exposing his back. His younger brother Max also wrestled for Missouri and won a national championship in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |title=Taking it to the Max |publisher=University of Missouri via website |date=April 16, 2010 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911220342/http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |archive-date=September 11, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAskren had a dominant Junior season in 2005\u201306, winning all 45 of his matches and pinning in 25 of them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2006/3/27/Ben_Askren_Named_2006_Recipient_of_Dan_Hodge_Trophy.aspx?path=wrestling  |title=Ben Askren Named 2006 Recipient of Dan Hodge Trophy |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=March 27, 2006}}</ref> He won the 174 pound weight class easily at both the [[Big 12]] and NCAA Championships.

Askren competed in the 74&nbsp;kg. weight class at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Askren won his first match via pin against Hungarian [[Istv\u00e1n Ver\u00e9b]]. In his round of 8 match he lost to Cuba's [[Ivan Fundora]] 1\u20133, 0\u20134.

He also competed in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC).\n\n== Wrestling ==\nAskren was an assistant [[wrestling]] coach at [[Arizona State University]] and was an American [[collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]] for the [[University of Missouri]]. He is a two-time state champion in wrestling at [[Arrowhead High School]] in [[Hartland, Wisconsin]].<ref>http://wrestling.teamusa.org/athletes/ben-askren</ref>\n\n=== Collegiate wrestling ===\n\nIn college, he wrestled in the 174&nbsp;lb. [[weight class]]. He lost the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) championship match to [[Chris Pendleton]] in both 2004 and 2005 before winning it in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his pinning ability (he holds the single-season NCAA pin record); his massive afro; and his \"funky\", or unorthodox, wrestling style. For example, while being ridden in the 2005 championship match, he attempted to reach around and apply a [[headlock]] to Pendleton, a move that any wrestling coach would disavow. His tall, lanky body \u2014 in sharp contrast to the squat, muscular physiques of many top wrestlers \u2014 allows him to attempt moves that most wrestlers could not. This characteristic later led to a challenging transition to freestyle wrestling early in his career, as the freestyle rules differ from folkstyle wrestling and penalize a wrestler for exposing his back. His younger brother Max also wrestled for Missouri and won a national championship in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |title=Taking it to the Max |publisher=University of Missouri via website |date=April 16, 2010 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911220342/http://mizzouwire.missouri.edu/stories/2010/askren-champion/ |archive-date=September 11, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAskren had a dominant Junior season in 2005\u201306, winning all 45 of his matches and pinning in 25 of them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2006/3/27/Ben_Askren_Named_2006_Recipient_of_Dan_Hodge_Trophy.aspx?path=wrestling  |title=Ben Askren Named 2006 Recipient of Dan Hodge Trophy |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=March 27, 2006}}</ref> He won the 174 pound weight class easily at both the [[Big 12]] and NCAA Championships.

Herbert was also undefeated going into the NCAA finals. Askren's season earned him the Outstanding Wrestler award at the NCAA Championships as well as the Dan Hodge Trophy and the Rev Wrestler of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2006/3/23/Askren_Named_2006_Rev_Wrestler_of_the_Year.aspx?path=wrestling |title=Askren Named 2006 Rev Wrestler of the Year |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=March 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAskren continued that dominance going into his Senior year in 2006\u201307, going undefeated again with a record of 42\u20130.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2007/3/17/Ben_Askren_Repeats_as_National_Champ_Tigers_Finish_Third.aspx?path=wrestling |title=Ben Askren Repeats as National Champ, Tigers Finish Third |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=March 17, 2007}}</ref>  He won his second consecutive NCAA Championship at 174 pounds by defeating another future NCAA champion, second-ranked Keith Gavin of Pittsburgh, 8\u20132. Askren finished his collegiate career with an 87 match winning streak. He also became only the second person to win the Dan Hodge Trophy twice, as W.I.N. Magazine named the 2007 winner. Askren was again named the Rev Wrestler of the Year. He also received the [[Schalles Award]], named after [[Wade Schalles]] and given to the most prolific pinner at the end of each season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutigers.com/news/2007/5/14/Missouri_Wrestling_Coach_and_Athlete_Earn_Honors.aspx?path=wrestling\n |title=Missouri Wrestling Coach and Athlete Earn Honors |publisher=MU Tigers Athletics via website |date=May 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAskren finished his collegiate wrestling career with a record of 153\u20138, with 91 of those victories coming by way of fall.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Those 91 pins put him at third on the all-time NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] pins list. In his four-year career at Missouri, Askren only lost to two opponents, Chris Pendleton of Oklahoma St. and Ryan Lange of Purdue.  He was also a four-time [[All-American]], including being only the twelfth Division I wrestler ever to be a four-time finalist. Askren was also nominated for an [[ESPY]] in 2007 in the category Best Male College Athlete.\nOn January 9, 2012 it was announced that Askren would be one of six new inductees to the [[University of Missouri]] Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartlandconnection.com/sports/story.aspx?id=705673 |title=Six chosen for University of Missouri Athletics Hall of Fame |publisher=KTVO-TV via website |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918161234/http://www.heartlandconnection.com/sports/story.aspx?id=705673 |archive-date=2013-09-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 Olympics ===\n{{For|more about wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}\nIn the summer of 2008, Askren defeated national runner-up Tyrone Lewis in two consecutive matches by decision at the US Olympic Trials in Las Vegas, becoming the second University of Missouri wrestler to qualify for the Olympics. [[Sammie Henson]], who also attended Missouri but finished his college wrestling career at [[Clemson University|Clemson]], competed in the 2000 Olympics winning a silver medal. Askren competed in the 74&nbsp;kg. weight class at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Askren won his first match via pin against Hungarian [[Istv\u00e1n Ver\u00e9b]]. In his round of 8 match he lost to Cuba's [[Ivan Fundora]] 1\u20133, 0\u20134. The Cuban's loss to Russia's [[Buvaisar Saitiev]] in the quarterfinal round ended Askren's hopes of a medal at the [[Wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Games]].\n\nAskren was asked if inexperience was a factor. Though he was a two-time NCAA champion at the University of Missouri he was relatively new to freestyle after wrestling folkstyle in college. \"That wasn't it,\" he said with tears in his eyes, \"I just wasn't good enough. I sucked.\" <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer08/columns/story?id=3544007 | title=Askren's long wait for shot on Olympic mat ends in tears | publisher=ESPN via website}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Olympic Career ===\nAlthough Askren decided to pursue a career in MMA after the Olympics, he continued to compete in wrestling occasionally. In 2010, he avenged his Olympic loss by defeating Fundora in the semifinals of the [[Cerro Pelado International]], in Cuba. This came shortly after Askren won the [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] Memorial International. Later in the same year, Askren defeated 2009 world silver medalist Jake Herbert in a folkstyle rules match at the Midlands Tournament. Askren also competed in the Agon Wrestling Championships and the Flo Premier League.

Working with fellow Breton farmers, Gourvennec lobbied for improvements to Brittany's infrastructure, including better roads, telephone network, education and port access. By 1972 he had successfully secured funding and work to develop a deep-water[[Port of Bloscon-Roscoff|port at Roscoff]]. Gourvennec had no desire to run a ferry service, but existing operators showed little appetite for the opportunity. \n\nAs was the way of a man known as \"the [[bulldozer]]\", {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} he took the reins and did it himself.\n\nThe company itself began sailings on 2nd January 1973 between [[Roscoff]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Plymouth]] in the South West of England, using the freight ferry ''Kerisnel'' a former Israeli tank carrier. The company's primary aim at that time was to exploit opportunities presented by the UK's entry into the Common Market (forerunner to the EU), to take control away from hated middle-men in Paris and export directly to markets in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn 1974, ''Kerisnel'' was replaced by ''Penn-Ar-Bed'', which carried both passengers and vehicles, and the BAI company adopted the name Brittany Ferries.<ref name=Hoyle&Pinder>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hoyle |editor1-first=B S |editor2-last=Pinder |editor2-first=David |title=European Port Cities in Transition |date=1992 |publisher=Belhaven Press in association with the British Association for the Advancement of Science |location=London |isbn=9780470219263 |page=92}}</ref>  Such was the success of the Plymouth-Roscoff service that a larger ship, ''Cornouailles'', was ordered and entered service in 1977. New routes were developed in the late 1970s, and the company continued to grow. Routes to [[Saint-Malo]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in Ireland were operated by {{MV|Armorique|1973|2}} and ''Prince of Brittany'', and in the early 1980s a second ship was chartered for the Saint-Malo route. ''[[MV Wickersham|Goelo]]'', an attractive-looking vessel, left the fleet in preparation for the new ship to be introduced in 1982. {{MV|Quiberon||2}} replaced ''Armorique'' for the Santander and Cork services, allowing her to operate alongside ''Prince of Brittany'' on the Saint-Malo route, while ''Cornouailles'' maintained the original routes from Roscoff.\n\n''Benodet'' operated between Plymouth and Roscoff for just one year before being redeployed as part of Brittany Ferries' new venture, [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]. ''Tregastel'' replaced her and continued on the Plymouth to Roscoff route until 1989.  The Cork route was operated by ''Tregastel'' and ''Quiberon'', later to be joined by ''Celtic Pride'', operated by Swansea Cork Ferries, supplying a midweek Cork-Roscoff round trip.\n\nIn 1985, Brittany Ferries further expanded by buying Truckline Ferries, which operated freight-only ships {{MV|Coutances||2}} and ''Purbeck'' between [[Poole]] in United Kingdom and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in France.\n\nIn 1986, Brittany Ferries introduced {{MV|Duc de Normandie||2}}, which operated a new route from Caen to the increasingly popular port of Portsmouth.  The former Roscoff ship ''Cornouailles'' was transferred to the Truckline Ferries route from Poole to Cherbourg, introducing passenger services on this route.  This service was also very successful, and new ships were introduced over the next few years.  Meanwhile, a second (chartered) ship, ''Gotland'' was installed on the Caen service in 1988, as well as the new Truckline Ferries vessel {{MV|Normandie Shipper||2}} in 1989. In addition to the Portsmouth-Caen services, from 1986 a Truckline Ferries ferry ran from Poole to Caen during the summer to cope with the seasonal demand on Brittany's standard ships by holiday makers. However, the introduction of larger ships in 2006, and the sale of the original \"truckliners\", meant that this service was discontinued.\n\nIn 1989, the cruise ferry {{MV|Bretagne||2}} was introduced on the Santander and Cork routes.  She displaced ''Quiberon'', which transferred to the Roscoff route. ''Tregastel'' replaced ''Cornouailles'' on the Poole-Cherbourg Truckline Ferries passenger route along with ''Corbiere'' (formerly ''Benodet'' who had been transferred to [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]).  ''Cornouailles'' was sold to British Channel Island Ferries and was renamed ''Havelet''. A second-hand purchase was introduced on the St Malo route, ''Duchesse Anne''. which was to run alongside ''Armorique''.  This allowed ''Prince of Brittany'' to be transferred to the Caen route under its new name, ''Reine Mathilde''.\n\n===1990s===\nAt the end of 1991, ''Reine Mathilde'' left the fleet ready for the introduction of the new cruise ferry ''Normandie'' on the Caen route. ''Corbiere'' and ''Tregastel'' also stepped down in preparation for the new Truckline Ferries ship, ''Barfleur''.  During 1992, the Truckline Ferries freight vessel, ''Purbeck'', and the St Malo ship ''Armorique'' both stepped down.\n\nIn 1993, the penultimate ship of the 1990s was introduced.  The Val de Loire was purchased from [[TT-Line]] and partially rebuilt for service on the [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and Cork routes.  The vessel replaced ''Bretagne'' which transferred to the St Malo route, allowing ''Duchesse Anne'' to operate new services between Poole, St Malo, Cork, Roscoff and Plymouth. Following further financial difficulties in the mid-1990s, these new routes were ended and ''Duchesse Anne'' left the fleet. ''Normandie Shipper'' was also sold, but the ex-Truckline Ferries vessel ''Purbeck'' was later chartered back by the company for use on various routes, primarily Portsmouth-Caen.  In 1999, ''Barfleur'' was repainted in Brittany Ferries colours, ending the Truckline Ferries tradition on the route.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001 a new fast ferry service began to operate between Poole and Cherbourg in partnership with [[Condor Ferries]].  The fast ''Normandie Vitesse'' could make the voyage in just over two hours.  In 2002, a new ship, ''Mont St Michel'', was due to enter service between Portsmouth and Caen. ''Duc de Normandie'' was transferred to the Roscoff route in July, whilst ''Quiberon'' was sent to Caen to cover until the new ship arrived. ''Mont St Michel'' was delayed until December however. ''Quiberon'' spent the remainder of the year on the busiest Brittany Ferries route.  She had been with the company for almost 21 years when she was sold in 2003.  In 2004, another new ship, ''Pont-Aven'', was introduced on the Santander & Cork routes.  She could travel much faster than the rest of the fleet, cutting journey times by a quarter. \n\nIn late 2004, the company withdrew ''Duc de Normandie'' from the fleet. ''Bretagne'' transferred to the Roscoff route, leaving ''Val de Loire'' at St Malo. ''Coutances'' was also earmarked for disposal, but then a change of heart resulted in its refit, losing her Truckline Ferries livery in favour of the new Brittany Ferries logo.\n\nMore changes occurred in 2005 with the withdrawal of [[P&O Ferries|P&O]]'s French routes from Portsmouth.  A new fastcraft, ''Normandie Express'' was chartered to operate between Portsmouth and Cherbourg and Caen.  In addition, the Poole-Cherbourg ship ''Barfleur'' was redeployed to operate a triangular service between Portsmouth, Poole and Cherbourg.  A new ship was announced, in part a replacement for ''Coutances''. The ship was named ''Cotentin''. ''Purbeck'' was to have returned from operating in New Zealand and cover the Portsmouth-Cherbourg link but this plan was dropped. ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg link in November 2005.\n\nThe former flagship of the fleet (from 1993 until the arrival of ''Mont St Michel'') ''Val de Loire'' left the fleet in February 2006, having been sold to [[DFDS]] and renamed ''King of Scandinavia''. In the meantime, Brittany Ferries had taken up a 2-year charter of the DFDS ship ''Duke of Scandinavia'', which was renamed ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' and ran on the Plymouth-Roscoff route. ''Bretagne'' returned to the Portsmouth-St Malo route. Brittany Ferries also announced a new build for the Plymouth-Roscoff route, to be launched early 2008.  In February 2006 ''Normandie Express'' was brought under the French flag, she was later purchased by the company in early 2007.  Brittany Ferries new freight ship, ''Cotentin'', entered service on 26 November 2007 with the 23:45 Cherbourg-Poole service.  The new ship also operated a weekly service to Santander from Poole. It was announced on 19 December 2007 that the company had purchased ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' from DFDS. On 1 May 2008 ''Coutances'' completed her last sailing for the company - having been with Truckline Ferries for 30 years and with Brittany Ferries since 1985.  In early 2009, ''Armorique'' was launched on the Plymouth-Roscoff route, replacing ''Pont L'Abbe''. For 2009, ''Pont-Aven'' operated a new Portsmouth to Santander service once a week (cutting the previous Plymouth to Santander route to once a week).\n\n===2010s===\nIn late 2009, the new [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] freight-only service was deemed a success and the frequency was doubled: there would now be two services a week operated by ''Cotentin''. In November 2009, ''Armorique'' was laid up for the rest of the winter season. Major changes were announced in December 2009. ''Barfleur'' was withdrawn from service at the end of January 2010 after nearly 18 years service on the Poole-[[Cherbourg]] route. The service was temporarily served by ''Armorique'', which came back to service earlier than originally planned. The Poole-Santander service reverted to one sailing a week with ''Cotentin'' covering freight on the Poole-Cherbourg service in the absence of ''Barfleur''. ''Condor Vitesse'' continued to operate one round sailing a day in the summer months between the two ports. ''Cap Finist\u00e8re'' ran between [[Portsmouth]] and Santander twice a week and also operated three round trips a week between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. In September 2010, Brittany Ferries announced plans to serve the Portsmouth\u2013[[Bilbao]] route recently abandoned by P&O Ferries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|title=Brittany Ferries saves Portsmouth-Bilbao route|work=Travel News UK|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=8 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012443/http://traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|archivedate=4 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The route started on 27 March 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg route on a seven-month trial basis after being laid up for a year. Her final crossing of 2011 was 3 October. The return of ''Barfleur'' allowed ''Cotentin'' to run two Poole-Santander trips a week. However, with ''Barfleur'' being laid up again, the Poole-Santander sailings reverted to one trip a week. On 23 March, it was announced that ''Barfleur'' was to be chartered to [[DFDS Seaways]] for use on their [[Dover]]\u2013[[Calais]] route. Her first sailing on the route was on 27 April.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, the new [[Portsmouth International Port]] (PIP) terminal, used by Brittany Ferries, [[LD Lines]] and [[Condor Ferries]], was opened to the public. An official opening ceremony took place on 13 May 2011. This modern, stylish, eco-friendly building replaced the previous terminal building that stood from 1976 until its well needed replacement occurred in 2011.\n\nOn 21 September 2012, Brittany Ferries cancelled sailings indefinitely following two days of wild[[cat]] strikes caused by crew members who were unhappy with changes in working terms and conditions. Meetings took place between management and unions to negotiate the management proposals. A vote was taken on 30 September by union members to decide if the management proposals would be accepted. The crew members accepted the proposal and services resumed on 2 October after 12 days without services. During this period, Brittany Ferries made special arrangements with P&O Ferries and [[MyFerryLink]] to accept Brittany Ferries tickets on the Dover\u2013Calais route; any unused tickets were refunded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19671784|title=Brittany Ferries services halted 'until further notice'|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> Services were not affected on the Poole\u2013Cherbourg route which was being operated by [[Condor Ferries]].\n\nThe 2012 season was the last year of the [[Poole]]\u2013[[Cherbourg]] fastcraft operation with [[Condor Ferries]]. For the first time since 2001, the Condor vessel operating the Poole-Cherbourg summer service was ''Condor Express'' rather than ''Condor Vitesse''.\n\nIn May 2013, Brittany Ferries introduced a new route with services from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Le Havre]] using their high-speed vessel, ''Normandie Express''.\n\nIn October 2013, Brittany Ferries' [[freight]] service from [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] terminated and ''Cotentin'', which served the route, is now being chartered by [[Stena Line]].\n\nOn 5 November 2013, Christophe Mathieu, deputy managing director of Brittany Ferries and Sandie Dawe, chief executive of [[VisitBritain]], signed an agreement to run a joint marketing campaign designed to attract more French tourists to the UK. The agreement commits both parties to a three-year campaign with a promotional match-funded spend of \u00a31.5 million, and is the first time Brittany Ferries has entered into such an arrangement with Visit Britain.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, Brittany Ferries announced that as from the end of March 2014, it would charter the former Visentini-built [[DFDS Seaways]] {{ship||Norman Voyager}} to operate on [[Le Havre]], Portsmouth and Santander. The vessel was renamed {{MV|Etretat||2}}.\n\nDuring the weekends, the ferry sails on Portsmouth\u2013Santander. Demand for freight capacity is high during the weekend, but also passengers are interested in such a service.\n\nOn weekdays, ''Norman Voyager'', which has been renamed ''Etretat'', sails on Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre, a route that was successful in 2013 when Brittany Ferries introduced the catamaran {{ship|HSC|Normandie Express||2}}. However, after the 2015 summer season, Brittany Ferries pulled ''Normandie Express'' from this route as it was not financially viable. The \"new\" ro-pax ferry ''Etretat'' will sail year-round.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, Brittany Ferries announced that it would charter the [[DFDS Seaways]] vessel {{MS|Sirena Seaways||2}} from the beginning of April 2015 and start service with Brittany Ferries in May 2015, to operate on their successful Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre route, alongside ''Etretat''. It will also operate a twice weekly Portsmouth\u2013Spain service. The ship will be renamed {{MV|Baie de Seine||2}}.\n\nThe company chartered the RoRo vessel, {{ship|MN|Pelican||2}} from Maritime Nantaise for 12 months, with the option of an extension. The vessel has the capacity for around one hundred unaccompanied trailers and twelve drivers and commenced service with Brittany Ferries on 11 February 2016.\n\nOn 24 October 2016, Brittany Ferries announced plans to build a ferry that could integrate a propulsion liquefied natural gas (LNG). An innovative project, that was abandoned in late 2014, which would be reborn as a smaller vessel to sail between Portsmouth and [[Ouistreham]].\n\nOn 20 June 2017, Brittany Ferries confirmed its order for a new LNG-powered cruise-ferry for the Portsmouth to Ouistreham route. The new 42,000 GT ship, to be constructed by Flensburger Schiffbau shipyard in Germany, is scheduled for delivery in 2019. The new ship is to be named ''Honfleur''.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, Brittany Ferries announced it will extend its charter of freight vessel ''Pelican'' from Maritime Nantaise for a further two years. The vessel, capable of carrying up to 100 unoccupied trailers, will continue to operate on the [[Poole]] to [[Bilbao]] route.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, Brittany Ferries announced it will begin a new route from Cork, [[Ireland]] to [[Santander, Spain]]. The new route, which will consist of two weekly connections along with an additional weekly service between Cork, [[Ireland]] & [[Roscoff]], [[France]], commenced in May 2018. Brittany Ferries is chartering the Stena RoRo Vessel [[MS Norman Asturias|''Asterion'']] which is currently serving routes between Italy and Greece and will be renamed [[MS Norman Asturias|''Connemara'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/portsmouth-based-brittany-ferries-expands-its-route-network-in-2018/|title=Portsmouth-based Brittany Ferries expands its route network in 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2018, work commenced on the construction of ''Honfleur'' with the Steel Cutting [[Ceremony]]. Unfortunately, the construction of the vessel will take a little over a year to complete.\n\nOn 24 May 2018, Brittany Ferries confirmed that it had ordered a second Stena E-Flexer vessel with the option to buy after the five-year charter.

It is not uncommon, as a positioning move, to operate a service from Plymouth - St Malo - Portsmouth, or vice versa. These services are generally noted on the on-line timetables and are open to passengers.\n\nIn previous years during the Christmas and New Year period, Brittany Ferries chartered '''Pont-Aven''  to Mistral Holidays, who operate cruises to [[Rouen]] and [[Antwerp]]. The cruise generally leaves [[Portsmouth International Port]] and spends two days in the Continental port. ''Pont-Aven'' is therefore the only ship which operates on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Brittany Ferries parted company with Mistral Holidays in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Brittany Ferries announced that they would be solely operating a New Year cruise to Rouen on ''Pont-Aven''.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: From the Land to the Sea / De la Terre a la Mer|date=1993|publisher=Ferry Publications.|location=Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire|isbn=1871947170|language=English, French}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 1973\u20132007|date=2007|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=1871947898}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 40 memorable years of service, hospitality and holidays|date=2013|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=9781906608521}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Brittany Ferries}}\n* [http://www.brittanyferries.com Official Brittany Ferries Website] \n\n\n[[Category:Ferry companies of France]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of England]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of Spain]]\n[[Category:Transport in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Connections across the English Channel]]\n[[Category:Transport companies established in 1972]]\n[[Category:1972 establishments in France]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the ferry company|the historic trimaran|Brittany Ferries (trimaran)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}\n{{infobox company\n| name = Brittany Ferries\n| logo = Logo bf original bloc marque.jpg\n| type = [[Private company]]\n| predecessor = \n| successor = \n| founder = [[Alexis Gourvennec]]\n| defunct = \n| fate = \n| area_served = [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]]\n| key_people = Jean-Marc Rou\u00e9<br>Christophe Mathieu<br>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pouget<br>Corinne Vintner<br>\n| industry = Passenger transportation<br>Freight transportation<br>Holidays\n| genre = [[Holiday]]s\n| products = \n| services = \n| revenue = {{increase}} \u20ac444.2&nbsp;million (2018)\n| operating_income = \n| net_income = \n| aum = \n| assets = \u20ac444.2&nbsp;million (2018)\n| equity = \n| owner = BAI Bretagne Angleterre Irlande S.A.\n| num_employees = {{decrease}} 2,787 (2018 average - high and low seasons)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.brittany-ferries.com/en/iso_album/2014bilancaconsolide.pdf|title=Brittany Ferries Bilan Consolid\u00e9 (Balance Sheet), including employee numbers|work=Brittany Ferries Corporate}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n| parent = \n| divisions = \n| subsid = \n| footnotes = \n| intl = \n| caption = \n| foundation = 1973\n| location_city = \n| location_country = \n| location = [[Roscoff]], [[France]]\n| locations = \n| homepage = [http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk www.brittany-ferries.co.uk]\n}}\n\n'''Brittany Ferries''' (founded in 1973 by [[Alexis Gourvennec]]) is the trading name of French shipping company BAI Bretagne Angleterre Irlande S.A. that operates a fleet of ferries and cruiseferries between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Spain]], and between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]]. \n\n==History==\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n\n[[File:Brittanyferries1980s.png|thumb|Brittany Ferries logo until 1984]]\n[[File:Centro Bot\u00edn 1 - Santander.jpg|thumb|right|The ship [[MV Cap Finist\u00e8re]] of Brittany Ferries entering the port of Santander.]]\n\nBAI (Bretagne Angleterre Irlande) S.A. was founded by firebrand farmer [[Alexis Gourvennec]]. Working with fellow Breton farmers, Gourvennec lobbied for improvements to Brittany's infrastructure, including better roads, telephone network, education and port access. By 1972 he had successfully secured funding and work to develop a deep-water[[Port of Bloscon-Roscoff|port at Roscoff]]. Gourvennec had no desire to run a ferry service, but existing operators showed little appetite for the opportunity. \n\nAs was the way of a man known as \"the [[bulldozer]]\", {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} he took the reins and did it himself.\n\nThe company itself began sailings on 2nd January 1973 between [[Roscoff]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Plymouth]] in the South West of England, using the freight ferry ''Kerisnel'' a former Israeli tank carrier. The company's primary aim at that time was to exploit opportunities presented by the UK's entry into the Common Market (forerunner to the EU), to take control away from hated middle-men in Paris and export directly to markets in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn 1974, ''Kerisnel'' was replaced by ''Penn-Ar-Bed'', which carried both passengers and vehicles, and the BAI company adopted the name Brittany Ferries.<ref name=Hoyle&Pinder>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hoyle |editor1-first=B S |editor2-last=Pinder |editor2-first=David |title=European Port Cities in Transition |date=1992 |publisher=Belhaven Press in association with the British Association for the Advancement of Science |location=London |isbn=9780470219263 |page=92}}</ref>  Such was the success of the Plymouth-Roscoff service that a larger ship, ''Cornouailles'', was ordered and entered service in 1977. New routes were developed in the late 1970s, and the company continued to grow. Routes to [[Saint-Malo]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in Ireland were operated by {{MV|Armorique|1973|2}} and ''Prince of Brittany'', and in the early 1980s a second ship was chartered for the Saint-Malo route. ''[[MV Wickersham|Goelo]]'', an attractive-looking vessel, left the fleet in preparation for the new ship to be introduced in 1982. {{MV|Quiberon||2}} replaced ''Armorique'' for the Santander and Cork services, allowing her to operate alongside ''Prince of Brittany'' on the Saint-Malo route, while ''Cornouailles'' maintained the original routes from Roscoff.\n\n''Benodet'' operated between Plymouth and Roscoff for just one year before being redeployed as part of Brittany Ferries' new venture, [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]. ''Tregastel'' replaced her and continued on the Plymouth to Roscoff route until 1989.  The Cork route was operated by ''Tregastel'' and ''Quiberon'', later to be joined by ''Celtic Pride'', operated by Swansea Cork Ferries, supplying a midweek Cork-Roscoff round trip.\n\nIn 1985, Brittany Ferries further expanded by buying Truckline Ferries, which operated freight-only ships {{MV|Coutances||2}} and ''Purbeck'' between [[Poole]] in United Kingdom and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in France.\n\nIn 1986, Brittany Ferries introduced {{MV|Duc de Normandie||2}}, which operated a new route from Caen to the increasingly popular port of Portsmouth.  The former Roscoff ship ''Cornouailles'' was transferred to the Truckline Ferries route from Poole to Cherbourg, introducing passenger services on this route.  This service was also very successful, and new ships were introduced over the next few years.  Meanwhile, a second (chartered) ship, ''Gotland'' was installed on the Caen service in 1988, as well as the new Truckline Ferries vessel {{MV|Normandie Shipper||2}} in 1989. In addition to the Portsmouth-Caen services, from 1986 a Truckline Ferries ferry ran from Poole to Caen during the summer to cope with the seasonal demand on Brittany's standard ships by holiday makers. However, the introduction of larger ships in 2006, and the sale of the original \"truckliners\", meant that this service was discontinued.\n\nIn 1989, the cruise ferry {{MV|Bretagne||2}} was introduced on the Santander and Cork routes.  She displaced ''Quiberon'', which transferred to the Roscoff route. ''Tregastel'' replaced ''Cornouailles'' on the Poole-Cherbourg Truckline Ferries passenger route along with ''Corbiere'' (formerly ''Benodet'' who had been transferred to [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]).  ''Cornouailles'' was sold to British Channel Island Ferries and was renamed ''Havelet''. A second-hand purchase was introduced on the St Malo route, ''Duchesse Anne''. which was to run alongside ''Armorique''.  This allowed ''Prince of Brittany'' to be transferred to the Caen route under its new name, ''Reine Mathilde''.\n\n===1990s===\nAt the end of 1991, ''Reine Mathilde'' left the fleet ready for the introduction of the new cruise ferry ''Normandie'' on the Caen route. ''Corbiere'' and ''Tregastel'' also stepped down in preparation for the new Truckline Ferries ship, ''Barfleur''.  During 1992, the Truckline Ferries freight vessel, ''Purbeck'', and the St Malo ship ''Armorique'' both stepped down.\n\nIn 1993, the penultimate ship of the 1990s was introduced.  The Val de Loire was purchased from [[TT-Line]] and partially rebuilt for service on the [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and Cork routes.  The vessel replaced ''Bretagne'' which transferred to the St Malo route, allowing ''Duchesse Anne'' to operate new services between Poole, St Malo, Cork, Roscoff and Plymouth. Following further financial difficulties in the mid-1990s, these new routes were ended and ''Duchesse Anne'' left the fleet. ''Normandie Shipper'' was also sold, but the ex-Truckline Ferries vessel ''Purbeck'' was later chartered back by the company for use on various routes, primarily Portsmouth-Caen.  In 1999, ''Barfleur'' was repainted in Brittany Ferries colours, ending the Truckline Ferries tradition on the route.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001 a new fast ferry service began to operate between Poole and Cherbourg in partnership with [[Condor Ferries]].  The fast ''Normandie Vitesse'' could make the voyage in just over two hours.  In 2002, a new ship, ''Mont St Michel'', was due to enter service between Portsmouth and Caen. ''Duc de Normandie'' was transferred to the Roscoff route in July, whilst ''Quiberon'' was sent to Caen to cover until the new ship arrived. ''Mont St Michel'' was delayed until December however. ''Quiberon'' spent the remainder of the year on the busiest Brittany Ferries route.  She had been with the company for almost 21 years when she was sold in 2003.  In 2004, another new ship, ''Pont-Aven'', was introduced on the Santander & Cork routes.  She could travel much faster than the rest of the fleet, cutting journey times by a quarter. \n\nIn late 2004, the company withdrew ''Duc de Normandie'' from the fleet. ''Bretagne'' transferred to the Roscoff route, leaving ''Val de Loire'' at St Malo. ''Coutances'' was also earmarked for disposal, but then a change of heart resulted in its refit, losing her Truckline Ferries livery in favour of the new Brittany Ferries logo.\n\nMore changes occurred in 2005 with the withdrawal of [[P&O Ferries|P&O]]'s French routes from Portsmouth.  A new fastcraft, ''Normandie Express'' was chartered to operate between Portsmouth and Cherbourg and Caen.  In addition, the Poole-Cherbourg ship ''Barfleur'' was redeployed to operate a triangular service between Portsmouth, Poole and Cherbourg.  A new ship was announced, in part a replacement for ''Coutances''. The ship was named ''Cotentin''. ''Purbeck'' was to have returned from operating in New Zealand and cover the Portsmouth-Cherbourg link but this plan was dropped. ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg link in November 2005.\n\nThe former flagship of the fleet (from 1993 until the arrival of ''Mont St Michel'') ''Val de Loire'' left the fleet in February 2006, having been sold to [[DFDS]] and renamed ''King of Scandinavia''. In the meantime, Brittany Ferries had taken up a 2-year charter of the DFDS ship ''Duke of Scandinavia'', which was renamed ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' and ran on the Plymouth-Roscoff route. ''Bretagne'' returned to the Portsmouth-St Malo route. Brittany Ferries also announced a new build for the Plymouth-Roscoff route, to be launched early 2008.  In February 2006 ''Normandie Express'' was brought under the French flag, she was later purchased by the company in early 2007.  Brittany Ferries new freight ship, ''Cotentin'', entered service on 26 November 2007 with the 23:45 Cherbourg-Poole service.  The new ship also operated a weekly service to Santander from Poole. It was announced on 19 December 2007 that the company had purchased ''Pont-L'Abb\u00e9'' from DFDS. On 1 May 2008 ''Coutances'' completed her last sailing for the company - having been with Truckline Ferries for 30 years and with Brittany Ferries since 1985.  In early 2009, ''Armorique'' was launched on the Plymouth-Roscoff route, replacing ''Pont L'Abbe''. For 2009, ''Pont-Aven'' operated a new Portsmouth to Santander service once a week (cutting the previous Plymouth to Santander route to once a week).\n\n===2010s===\nIn late 2009, the new [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] freight-only service was deemed a success and the frequency was doubled: there would now be two services a week operated by ''Cotentin''. In November 2009, ''Armorique'' was laid up for the rest of the winter season. Major changes were announced in December 2009. ''Barfleur'' was withdrawn from service at the end of January 2010 after nearly 18 years service on the Poole-[[Cherbourg]] route. The service was temporarily served by ''Armorique'', which came back to service earlier than originally planned. The Poole-Santander service reverted to one sailing a week with ''Cotentin'' covering freight on the Poole-Cherbourg service in the absence of ''Barfleur''. ''Condor Vitesse'' continued to operate one round sailing a day in the summer months between the two ports. ''Cap Finist\u00e8re'' ran between [[Portsmouth]] and Santander twice a week and also operated three round trips a week between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. In September 2010, Brittany Ferries announced plans to serve the Portsmouth\u2013[[Bilbao]] route recently abandoned by P&O Ferries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|title=Brittany Ferries saves Portsmouth-Bilbao route|work=Travel News UK|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=8 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012443/http://traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|archivedate=4 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The route started on 27 March 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg route on a seven-month trial basis after being laid up for a year. Her final crossing of 2011 was 3 October. The return of ''Barfleur'' allowed ''Cotentin'' to run two Poole-Santander trips a week. However, with ''Barfleur'' being laid up again, the Poole-Santander sailings reverted to one trip a week. On 23 March, it was announced that ''Barfleur'' was to be chartered to [[DFDS Seaways]] for use on their [[Dover]]\u2013[[Calais]] route. Her first sailing on the route was on 27 April.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, the new [[Portsmouth International Port]] (PIP) terminal, used by Brittany Ferries, [[LD Lines]] and [[Condor Ferries]], was opened to the public. An official opening ceremony took place on 13 May 2011. This modern, stylish, eco-friendly building replaced the previous terminal building that stood from 1976 until its well needed replacement occurred in 2011.\n\nOn 21 September 2012, Brittany Ferries cancelled sailings indefinitely following two days of wild[[cat]] strikes caused by crew members who were unhappy with changes in working terms and conditions. Meetings took place between management and unions to negotiate the management proposals. A vote was taken on 30 September by union members to decide if the management proposals would be accepted. The crew members accepted the proposal and services resumed on 2 October after 12 days without services. During this period, Brittany Ferries made special arrangements with P&O Ferries and [[MyFerryLink]] to accept Brittany Ferries tickets on the Dover\u2013Calais route; any unused tickets were refunded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19671784|title=Brittany Ferries services halted 'until further notice'|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> Services were not affected on the Poole\u2013Cherbourg route which was being operated by [[Condor Ferries]].\n\nThe 2012 season was the last year of the [[Poole]]\u2013[[Cherbourg]] fastcraft operation with [[Condor Ferries]]. For the first time since 2001, the Condor vessel operating the Poole-Cherbourg summer service was ''Condor Express'' rather than ''Condor Vitesse''.\n\nIn May 2013, Brittany Ferries introduced a new route with services from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Le Havre]] using their high-speed vessel, ''Normandie Express''.\n\nIn October 2013, Brittany Ferries' [[freight]] service from [[Poole]]-[[Santander, Spain|Santander]] terminated and ''Cotentin'', which served the route, is now being chartered by [[Stena Line]].\n\nOn 5 November 2013, Christophe Mathieu, deputy managing director of Brittany Ferries and Sandie Dawe, chief executive of [[VisitBritain]], signed an agreement to run a joint marketing campaign designed to attract more French tourists to the UK. The agreement commits both parties to a three-year campaign with a promotional match-funded spend of \u00a31.5 million, and is the first time Brittany Ferries has entered into such an arrangement with Visit Britain.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, Brittany Ferries announced that as from the end of March 2014, it would charter the former Visentini-built [[DFDS Seaways]] {{ship||Norman Voyager}} to operate on [[Le Havre]], Portsmouth and Santander. The vessel was renamed {{MV|Etretat||2}}.\n\nDuring the weekends, the ferry sails on Portsmouth\u2013Santander. Demand for freight capacity is high during the weekend, but also passengers are interested in such a service.\n\nOn weekdays, ''Norman Voyager'', which has been renamed ''Etretat'', sails on Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre, a route that was successful in 2013 when Brittany Ferries introduced the catamaran {{ship|HSC|Normandie Express||2}}. However, after the 2015 summer season, Brittany Ferries pulled ''Normandie Express'' from this route as it was not financially viable. The \"new\" ro-pax ferry ''Etretat'' will sail year-round.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, Brittany Ferries announced that it would charter the [[DFDS Seaways]] vessel {{MS|Sirena Seaways||2}} from the beginning of April 2015 and start service with Brittany Ferries in May 2015, to operate on their successful Portsmouth\u2013Le Havre route, alongside ''Etretat''. It will also operate a twice weekly Portsmouth\u2013Spain service. The ship will be renamed {{MV|Baie de Seine||2}}.\n\nThe company chartered the RoRo vessel, {{ship|MN|Pelican||2}} from Maritime Nantaise for 12 months, with the option of an extension. The vessel has the capacity for around one hundred unaccompanied trailers and twelve drivers and commenced service with Brittany Ferries on 11 February 2016.\n\nOn 24 October 2016, Brittany Ferries announced plans to build a ferry that could integrate a propulsion liquefied natural gas (LNG). An innovative project, that was abandoned in late 2014, which would be reborn as a smaller vessel to sail between Portsmouth and [[Ouistreham]].\n\nOn 20 June 2017, Brittany Ferries confirmed its order for a new LNG-powered cruise-ferry for the Portsmouth to Ouistreham route. The new 42,000 GT ship, to be constructed by Flensburger Schiffbau shipyard in Germany, is scheduled for delivery in 2019. The new ship is to be named ''Honfleur''.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, Brittany Ferries announced it will extend its charter of freight vessel ''Pelican'' from Maritime Nantaise for a further two years. The vessel, capable of carrying up to 100 unoccupied trailers, will continue to operate on the [[Poole]] to [[Bilbao]] route.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, Brittany Ferries announced it will begin a new route from Cork, [[Ireland]] to [[Santander, Spain]]. The new route, which will consist of two weekly connections along with an additional weekly service between Cork, [[Ireland]] & [[Roscoff]], [[France]], commenced in May 2018. Brittany Ferries is chartering the Stena RoRo Vessel [[MS Norman Asturias|''Asterion'']] which is currently serving routes between Italy and Greece and will be renamed [[MS Norman Asturias|''Connemara'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/portsmouth-based-brittany-ferries-expands-its-route-network-in-2018/|title=Portsmouth-based Brittany Ferries expands its route network in 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2018, work commenced on the construction of ''Honfleur'' with the Steel Cutting [[Ceremony]]. Unfortunately, the construction of the vessel will take a little over a year to complete.\n\nOn 24 May 2018, Brittany Ferries confirmed that it had ordered a second Stena E-Flexer vessel with the option to buy after the five-year charter. This takes the number to two chartered from [[Stena Line]] along with the new build vessel ''Honfleur'' expected in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/brittany-ferries-invests-in-two-new-cruise-ferries-for-long-haul-spanish-routes/|title=Brittany Ferries invests in two new cruise-ferries for long-haul Spanish routes}} To be called Galicia and Salamanca, the ships are expected to enter service in 2021 and 2022 respectively. </ref>\n\nIn October 2018, Brittany Ferries announced that a new logo will be used for marketing purposes and will appear on their vessels, with {{MV|Armorique|2008|2}} and {{MV|Pont-Aven||2}} being the first ships to receive the new livery. The logo is part of a multi-million pound investment in the company's future. 450 million euros has been earmarked for new ships, new brand (including logo) and a focus on more digital tools. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/brittany-ferries-fresh-new-look/|title=Brittany Ferries\u2019 fresh new look}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 March 2019, Brittany Ferries confirmed its order of a fourth new build (9th Stena [[E-Flexer-class ferry]]), chartered from Stena RoRo and will be built at the AVIC Weihai Shipyard in [[China]], due to join the fleet in the year 2023. Like two of the other  E-Flexer-Class Ferries Salamanca and Santo\u00f1a this vessel will also be powered by LNG (liquefied natural gas) (Galicia the first will be fitted with funnel exhaust gas cleaning systems) . <ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/brittany-ferries-confirms-fourth-new-cruise-ferry-post-brexit/|title=Brittany Ferries confirms fourth new cruise-ferry, post-Brexit}}</ref> This new ferry will be named [[E-Flexer-class ferry|''Santo\u00f1a'']].\n\nOn 20 June 2019, Brittany Ferries announced it was finalising a one-year charter of an additional ship from Stena Ro-Ro ahead of the 2020 season, which will be operated by the ferry company from November 2019 to November 2020 to deliver additional flexibility to a route network that connects France, the UK, Spain and Ireland. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://brittanyferriesnewsroom.com/new-ship-charter-will-secure-2020-season-schedules-says-brittany-ferries/|title=New ship charter will secure 2020 season schedules says Brittany Ferries}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 August 2019, MV Bore Bay arrived in [[Poole]] as a temporary cover for MN Pelican while she undergoes maintenance and fitting of exhaust scrubbers.

It is not uncommon, as a positioning move, to operate a service from Plymouth - St Malo - Portsmouth, or vice versa. These services are generally noted on the on-line timetables and are open to passengers.\n\nIn previous years during the Christmas and New Year period, Brittany Ferries chartered '''Pont-Aven''  to Mistral Holidays, who operate cruises to [[Rouen]] and [[Antwerp]]. The cruise generally leaves [[Portsmouth International Port]] and spends two days in the Continental port. ''Pont-Aven'' is therefore the only ship which operates on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Brittany Ferries parted company with Mistral Holidays in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Brittany Ferries announced that they would be solely operating a New Year cruise to Rouen on ''Pont-Aven''.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: From the Land to the Sea / De la Terre a la Mer|date=1993|publisher=Ferry Publications.|location=Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire|isbn=1871947170|language=English, French}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 1973\u20132007|date=2007|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=1871947898}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Miles|title=Brittany Ferries: 40 memorable years of service, hospitality and holidays|date=2013|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=9781906608521}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Brittany Ferries}}\n* [http://www.brittanyferries.com Official Brittany Ferries Website] \n\n\n[[Category:Ferry companies of France]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of England]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ferry companies of Spain]]\n[[Category:Transport in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Connections across the English Channel]]\n[[Category:Transport companies established in 1972]]\n[[Category:1972 establishments in France]]\n", "name_user": "Harry135", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2020s", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Ferries"}

The Germans were encouraged by their successes on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] into believing that they would be able to divert large numbers of troops to the Western Front in support of their goals. The Mexicans were willing to consider the alliance but declined the deal after Americans were informed of the Telegram.\n\n==Mexican response==\nMexican President [[Venustiano Carranza]] assigned a military commission to assess the feasibility of the Mexican takeover of their former territories contemplated by Germany.<ref>Katz (1981), p. 364.</ref> The generals concluded that it would be neither possible nor even desirable to attempt such an enterprise for the following reasons:\n\n* Mexico was in the midst of a civil war, and Carranza's position was far from secure. A declaration of war by his regime would have provided an opportunity for opposing factions to align with the United States and Allied Powers in exchange for diplomatic recognition. \n* The United States was far stronger militarily than Mexico was. Even if Mexico's military forces were completely united and loyal to a single regime, no serious scenario existed under which they could invade and win a war against the United States.\n* Germany's promises of \"generous financial support\" were very unreliable. The German government had already informed Carranza in June 1916 that they were unable to provide the necessary gold needed to stock a completely independent Mexican national bank.<ref name=\"William Beezley\">{{cite book | first1 = William | last1 = Beezley | first2 = Michael | last2 = Meyer | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Amt1ZXMeVYMC&q=%22gold+to+stock%22#v=snippet&q=%22gold%20to%20stock%22&f=false | title = The Oxford History of Mexico | page = 476 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = UK| isbn = 9780199779932 }}</ref> Even if Mexico received financial support, it would still need to purchase arms, ammunition, and other needed war supplies from the [[ABC nations]] (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), which would strain relations with them, as explained below.\n* Even if by some chance Mexico had the military means to win a conflict against the United States and reclaim the territories in question, Mexico would have severe difficulty conquering and pacifying a large English-speaking population that was both used to self-government and [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|better supplied with arms]] than most other civilian populations.\n* Other foreign relations were at stake. The ABC nations organized the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] in 1914 to avoid a full-scale war between the United States and Mexico over the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]]. If Mexico were to enter war against the United States, it would strain relations with those nations.\n\nThe Carranza government was recognized ''[[de jure]]'' by the United States on 31 August 1917 as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram since recognition was necessary to ensure [[Mexico in World War I|Mexican neutrality in World War I]].<ref name=\"Thomas Paterson\">{{cite book | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Paterson | first2 = J.

The word ''Arizona'' was not in the German codebook and thus had to be split into phonetic syllables.]]\n\nZimmermann's office sent the telegram to the German embassy in the United States for re-transmission to Eckardt in Mexico. It has traditionally been claimed that the telegram was sent over three routes: transmitted by radio and also sent over two [[transatlantic telegraph cable| trans-Atlantic telegraph cables]] operated by neutral governments (the United States and Sweden) for the use of their diplomatic services, but it has been established that only one method was used. The Germans delivered the message to the [[Embassy of the United States, Berlin|United States embassy in Berlin]], and it then passed by [[diplomatic cable]] first to Copenhagen and then to London for onward transmission over transatlantic cable to Washington.<ref name=\"Gannon\">{{cite book | ref= Gannon | last= Gannon | first= Paul | title= Inside Room 40: The Codebreakers of World War I | location= London | publisher= Ian Allan Publishing | year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0-7110-3408-2}}</ref> [[William Reginald Hall]], the head of [[Room 40]], spread the misinformation about the \"three routes\" to try to conceal from the United States the fact that [[Room 40]] was intercepting its cable traffic.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nDirect telegraph transmission of the telegram was impossible because the British had cut the German international cables at the outbreak of war. However, the United States allowed limited use of its diplomatic cables with Germany to communicate with its ambassador in Washington. The facility was supposed to be used for cables connected with President Woodrow Wilson's peace proposals.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/>\n\nThe Swedish cable ran from Sweden, and the United States cable from the United States embassy in [[Denmark]]. However, neither cable ran directly to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at [[Porthcurno]], near [[Land's End]], the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, particularly to the [[cryptanalysis| codebreakers]] and analysts in [[Room 40]] at the [[Admiralty]].<ref name=\"SigSec\">{{cite book | author-link= Rupert Allason | last= West | first= Nigel | title= The Sigint Secrets: The Signals Intelligence War, 1990 to Today-Including the Persecution of Gordon Welchman | publisher= Quill | location= New York | year= 1990 | isbn= 0-688-09515-1 | pages = 83, 87\u201392}}</ref>\n\nAfter their telegraph cables had been cut, the German Foreign Office appealed to the United States for use of their cable for diplomatic messages. President Wilson agreed in the belief both that such co-operation would sustain continued good relations with Germany and that more efficient German-American diplomacy could assist Wilson's goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the United States embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. However, the United States placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in clear, or uncoded. The Germans assumed that the cable was secure and used it extensively.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nHowever, that put German diplomats in a precarious situation: they relied on the United States to transmit Zimmermann's note to its final destination, but the message's unencrypted contents would be deeply alarming to the Americans. The Germans persuaded [[United States Ambassador to Germany |US Ambassador]] [[James W. Gerard]] to accept it in coded form, and it was transmitted on 16 January 1917.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nIn Room 40, [[Nigel de Grey]] had partially decoded the telegram by the next day.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/> By 1917, the diplomatic code 13040 had been along for many years\u2009and was old. Since Room 40 had had ample time to reconstruct it cryptanalytically, it was readable to a fair degree. Room 40 had previously obtained German cryptographic documents, including the diplomatic code 3512 (captured in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]), which was a later, updated code, similar to, but not really related to code 13040, and naval code SKM (Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine),\u2009\u2060useless for decoding the Zimmermann Telegram but valuable when it came to decoding naval traffic, which had been retrieved from the wrecked cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] by the Russians, who passed it to the British.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Polmar | first1= Norman | last2=  Noot | first2= Jurrien | title= Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies 1718\u20131990 | location= Annapolis | publisher= US Naval Institute Press | year= 1991 | lastauthoramp= y | ref= Polmar}}</ref> \n\nDisclosure of the telegram would sway public opinion in the United States against Germany if the British could convince the Americans that the text was genuine, but Room 40 chief William Reginald Hall was reluctant to let it out because the disclosure would expose the German codes broken in Room 40 and British eavesdropping on the United States cable. Hall waited three weeks. During this period, de Grey and cryptographer [[William Montgomery (cryptographer) |William Montgomery]] completed the decryption. On 1 February Germany announced resumption of \"unrestricted\" submarine warfare, an act which led the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Germany on 3 February.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n[[File:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|The Telegram, completely decrypted and translated]]\n\nHall passed the telegram to the British Foreign Office on 5 February, but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories which would serve to explain to the Americans how they obtained the coded text of the telegram without admitting to their ability to intercept American diplomatic communications, which they would continue to do for another 25 years, and also to explain how they obtained the cleartext of the telegram without letting the Germans know that their codes were broken. Furthermore, the British needed to find a way to convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.<ref name=BBC2017>\n{{cite news\n|title= Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?\n|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38581861\n|accessdate= 17 January 2017|work= BBC\n|date= 17 January 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFor the first story, the British obtained the coded text of the telegram from the Mexican commercial telegraph office. The British knew that since the German embassy in Washington would relay the message by commercial telegraph, the Mexican telegraph office would have the coded text. ''\"Mr. H\"'', a British agent in Mexico, bribed an employee of the commercial telegraph company for a copy of the message. (Sir [[Thomas Hohler]], the British ambassador in Mexico, claimed to have been ''\"Mr. H\"'' or at least involved with the interception in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}) That coded text could be shown to the Americans without embarrassment.\n\nMoreover, the retransmission was encoded with the older code 13040 and so by mid-February, the British had not only the complete text but also the ability to release the telegram without revealing the extent to which the latest German codes had been broken. (At worst, the Germans might have realized that the 13040 code had been compromised, but that was a risk worth taking against the possibility of United States entry into the war.) Finally, since copies of the 13040 codetext would also have been deposited in the records of the American commercial telegraph company, the British had the ability to prove the authenticity of the message to the United States government.<ref name=BBCHistory2017/>\n\nAs a cover story, the British could publicly claim that their agents had stolen the telegram's decoded text in Mexico. Privately, the British needed to give the Americans the 13040 code so that the United States government could verify the authenticity of the message independently with their own commercial telegraphic records, but the Americans agreed to back the official cover story. The German Foreign Office refused to consider a possible code break and instead sent Ambassador Eckardt on a witch-hunt for a traitor in the embassy in Mexico. (Eckardt indignantly rejected the accusations, and the Foreign Office eventually declared the embassy exonerated.)<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\n===Use===\nOn 19 February, Hall showed the telegram to Edward Bell, secretary of the United States Embassy in Britain. Bell, at first incredulous, thought that it was a forgery. Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On 20 February, Hall informally sent a copy to United States Ambassador [[Walter Hines Page]].

Pershing]] [[Pancho Villa Expedition|had long been chasing]] the revolutionary [[Pancho Villa]] for raiding into US territory  and carried out several cross-border expeditions. News of the telegram further inflamed tensions between the United States and Mexico.\n[[File:Exploding in his Hands.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|\"Exploding in his Hands\"]]\nHowever, there was also a notable [[anti-British sentiment]] in the United States, particularly among [[German Americans|German-]] and [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]]. Many Americans wished to avoid the conflict in Europe. Since the public had been told falsely that the telegram had been stolen in a decoded form in Mexico, the message was widely believed at first to be an elaborate forgery perpetrated by British intelligence. That belief, which was not restricted to pacifist and pro-German lobbies, was promoted by German and Mexican diplomats and by some American newspapers, especially the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] press empire. That presented the Wilson administration with a dilemma. With the evidence the United States had been provided confidentially by the British, Wilson realized the message was genuine but he could not make the evidence public without compromising the British codebreaking operation.\n\nAny doubts as to the authenticity of the telegram were removed by Zimmermann himself. At a press conference on 3 March 1917, he told an American journalist, \"I cannot deny it. It is true.\" Then, on 29 March 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in which he admitted the telegram was genuine.<ref>{{cite journal |ref= Meyer |last= Meyer |first= Michael C. |title= The Mexican-German Conspiracy of 1915 |journal= The Americas |volume= 23 |issue= 1  |pages= 76\u201389 |year=1966 |doi=10.2307/980141|jstor= 980141 }}</ref> Zimmermann hoped that Americans would understand that the idea was that Germany would only fund Mexico's war with the United States in the prior event of American entry into World War I.\n\nOn 1 February 1917, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships in the Atlantic bearing the American flag, both passenger and merchant ships.  Two ships were sunk in February, and most American shipping companies held their ships in port. Besides the highly provocative war proposal to Mexico, the telegram also mentioned \"ruthless employment of our submarines\". Public opinion demanded action. Wilson had previously refused to assign US Navy crews and guns to the merchant ships. However, once the Zimmermann note was public, Wilson called for arming the merchant ships, but [[anti-war]] elements in the [[United States Senate]] blocked his proposal.<ref>{{cite book | first = Richard W | last = Leopold | title = The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History | year = 1962 | pages = 330\u201331 | publisher = Random House}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1917, Congress voted to [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declare war on Germany]]; Wilson had asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] for \"a [[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur S. |last=Link |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910\u20131917 |year=1972 |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row |pages=252\u2013282 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nWoodrow Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and [[Tampico]] in 1917\u20131918,<ref name=\"Ernest Gruening\">{{cite book | first = Ernest | last = Gruening | year = 1968 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VoBlAAAAMAAJ&q=occupation+president+wilson | title = Mexico and Its Heritage | page = 596 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = U.S.}}</ref><ref name=\"Halevy\">{{cite book | first = Drew Philip | last = Halevy | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WOfKxFigGSwC | title = Threats of Intervention: U.

A declaration of war by his regime would have provided an opportunity for opposing factions to align with the United States and Allied Powers in exchange for diplomatic recognition. \n* The United States was far stronger militarily than Mexico was. Even if Mexico's military forces were completely united and loyal to a single regime, no serious scenario existed under which they could invade and win a war against the United States.\n* Germany's promises of \"generous financial support\" were very unreliable.

The ABC nations organized the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] in 1914 to avoid a full-scale war between the United States and Mexico over the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]]. If Mexico were to enter war against the United States, it would strain relations with those nations.\n\nThe Carranza government was recognized ''[[de jure]]'' by the United States on 31 August 1917 as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram since recognition was necessary to ensure [[Mexico in World War I|Mexican neutrality in World War I]].<ref name=\"Thomas Paterson\">{{cite book | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Paterson | first2 = J.

However, neither cable ran directly to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at [[Porthcurno]], near [[Land's End]], the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, particularly to the [[cryptanalysis| codebreakers]] and analysts in [[Room 40]] at the [[Admiralty]].<ref name=\"SigSec\">{{cite book | author-link= Rupert Allason | last= West | first= Nigel | title= The Sigint Secrets: The Signals Intelligence War, 1990 to Today-Including the Persecution of Gordon Welchman | publisher= Quill | location= New York | year= 1990 | isbn= 0-688-09515-1 | pages = 83, 87\u201392}}</ref>\n\nAfter their telegraph cables had been cut, the German Foreign Office appealed to the United States for use of their cable for diplomatic messages. President Wilson agreed in the belief both that such co-operation would sustain continued good relations with Germany and that more efficient German-American diplomacy could assist Wilson's goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the United States embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. However, the United States placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in clear, or uncoded. The Germans assumed that the cable was secure and used it extensively.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nHowever, that put German diplomats in a precarious situation: they relied on the United States to transmit Zimmermann's note to its final destination, but the message's unencrypted contents would be deeply alarming to the Americans. The Germans persuaded [[United States Ambassador to Germany |US Ambassador]] [[James W. Gerard]] to accept it in coded form, and it was transmitted on 16 January 1917.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\nIn Room 40, [[Nigel de Grey]] had partially decoded the telegram by the next day.<ref name=\"Gannon\"/> By 1917, the diplomatic code 13040 had been along for many years\u2009and was old. Since Room 40 had had ample time to reconstruct it cryptanalytically, it was readable to a fair degree. Room 40 had previously obtained German cryptographic documents, including the diplomatic code 3512 (captured in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]), which was a later, updated code, similar to, but not really related to code 13040, and naval code SKM (Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine),\u2009\u2060useless for decoding the Zimmermann Telegram but valuable when it came to decoding naval traffic, which had been retrieved from the wrecked cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] by the Russians, who passed it to the British.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Polmar | first1= Norman | last2=  Noot | first2= Jurrien | title= Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies 1718\u20131990 | location= Annapolis | publisher= US Naval Institute Press | year= 1991 | lastauthoramp= y | ref= Polmar}}</ref> \n\nDisclosure of the telegram would sway public opinion in the United States against Germany if the British could convince the Americans that the text was genuine, but Room 40 chief William Reginald Hall was reluctant to let it out because the disclosure would expose the German codes broken in Room 40 and British eavesdropping on the United States cable. Hall waited three weeks. During this period, de Grey and cryptographer [[William Montgomery (cryptographer) |William Montgomery]] completed the decryption. On 1 February Germany announced resumption of \"unrestricted\" submarine warfare, an act which led the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Germany on 3 February.<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n[[File:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|The Telegram, completely decrypted and translated]]\n\nHall passed the telegram to the British Foreign Office on 5 February, but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories which would serve to explain to the Americans how they obtained the coded text of the telegram without admitting to their ability to intercept American diplomatic communications, which they would continue to do for another 25 years, and also to explain how they obtained the cleartext of the telegram without letting the Germans know that their codes were broken. Furthermore, the British needed to find a way to convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.<ref name=BBC2017>\n{{cite news\n|title= Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?\n|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38581861\n|accessdate= 17 January 2017|work= BBC\n|date= 17 January 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFor the first story, the British obtained the coded text of the telegram from the Mexican commercial telegraph office. The British knew that since the German embassy in Washington would relay the message by commercial telegraph, the Mexican telegraph office would have the coded text. ''\"Mr. H\"'', a British agent in Mexico, bribed an employee of the commercial telegraph company for a copy of the message. (Sir [[Thomas Hohler]], the British ambassador in Mexico, claimed to have been ''\"Mr. H\"'' or at least involved with the interception in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}}) That coded text could be shown to the Americans without embarrassment.\n\nMoreover, the retransmission was encoded with the older code 13040 and so by mid-February, the British had not only the complete text but also the ability to release the telegram without revealing the extent to which the latest German codes had been broken. (At worst, the Germans might have realized that the 13040 code had been compromised, but that was a risk worth taking against the possibility of United States entry into the war.) Finally, since copies of the 13040 codetext would also have been deposited in the records of the American commercial telegraph company, the British had the ability to prove the authenticity of the message to the United States government.<ref name=BBCHistory2017/>\n\nAs a cover story, the British could publicly claim that their agents had stolen the telegram's decoded text in Mexico. Privately, the British needed to give the Americans the 13040 code so that the United States government could verify the authenticity of the message independently with their own commercial telegraphic records, but the Americans agreed to back the official cover story. The German Foreign Office refused to consider a possible code break and instead sent Ambassador Eckardt on a witch-hunt for a traitor in the embassy in Mexico. (Eckardt indignantly rejected the accusations, and the Foreign Office eventually declared the embassy exonerated.)<ref name=\"SigSec\"/>\n\n===Use===\nOn 19 February, Hall showed the telegram to Edward Bell, secretary of the United States Embassy in Britain. Bell, at first incredulous, thought that it was a forgery. Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On 20 February, Hall informally sent a copy to United States Ambassador [[Walter Hines Page]]. On 23 February, Page met with British Foreign Minister [[Arthur James Balfour|Arthur Balfour]] and was given the codetext, the message in German, and the English translation. Page then reported the story to President [[Woodrow Wilson]], including details to be verified from telegraph-company files in the United States. Wilson released the text to the media on 28 February 1917.\n\n==American response==\n[[File:Cartoon for a Telegram.jpg|thumb|210px|1917 political cartoon about the Zimmermann Telegram]]\nPopular sentiment in the United States at that time was [[anti-Mexican sentiment|anti-Mexican]] as well as [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], and in Mexico there was considerable [[anti-American sentiment]].<ref>{{cite book |ref= Link |last= Link |first= Arthur S. |title= Wilson: Campaigns for Progressivism and Peace: 1916\u20131917 |year= 1965 |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb01547.0005.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;cc=acls}}</ref> General [[John J.

News of the telegram further inflamed tensions between the United States and Mexico.\n[[File:Exploding in his Hands.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|\"Exploding in his Hands\"]]\nHowever, there was also a notable [[anti-British sentiment]] in the United States, particularly among [[German Americans|German-]] and [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]]. Many Americans wished to avoid the conflict in Europe. Since the public had been told falsely that the telegram had been stolen in a decoded form in Mexico, the message was widely believed at first to be an elaborate forgery perpetrated by British intelligence. That belief, which was not restricted to pacifist and pro-German lobbies, was promoted by German and Mexican diplomats and by some American newspapers, especially the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] press empire. That presented the Wilson administration with a dilemma. With the evidence the United States had been provided confidentially by the British, Wilson realized the message was genuine but he could not make the evidence public without compromising the British codebreaking operation.\n\nAny doubts as to the authenticity of the telegram were removed by Zimmermann himself. At a press conference on 3 March 1917, he told an American journalist, \"I cannot deny it. It is true.\" Then, on 29 March 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in which he admitted the telegram was genuine.<ref>{{cite journal |ref= Meyer |last= Meyer |first= Michael C. |title= The Mexican-German Conspiracy of 1915 |journal= The Americas |volume= 23 |issue= 1  |pages= 76\u201389 |year=1966 |doi=10.2307/980141|jstor= 980141 }}</ref> Zimmermann hoped that Americans would understand that the idea was that Germany would only fund Mexico's war with the United States in the prior event of American entry into World War I.\n\nOn 1 February 1917, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships in the Atlantic bearing the American flag, both passenger and merchant ships.  Two ships were sunk in February, and most American shipping companies held their ships in port. Besides the highly provocative war proposal to Mexico, the telegram also mentioned \"ruthless employment of our submarines\". Public opinion demanded action. Wilson had previously refused to assign US Navy crews and guns to the merchant ships. However, once the Zimmermann note was public, Wilson called for arming the merchant ships, but [[anti-war]] elements in the [[United States Senate]] blocked his proposal.<ref>{{cite book | first = Richard W | last = Leopold | title = The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History | year = 1962 | pages = 330\u201331 | publisher = Random House}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1917, Congress voted to [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declare war on Germany]]; Wilson had asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] for \"a [[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur S. |last=Link |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910\u20131917 |year=1972 |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row |pages=252\u2013282 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nWoodrow Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and [[Tampico]] in 1917\u20131918,<ref name=\"Ernest Gruening\">{{cite book | first = Ernest | last = Gruening | year = 1968 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VoBlAAAAMAAJ&q=occupation+president+wilson | title = Mexico and Its Heritage | page = 596 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = U.S.}}</ref><ref name=\"Halevy\">{{cite book | first = Drew Philip | last = Halevy | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WOfKxFigGSwC | title = Threats of Intervention: U.
