{"title_page": "Remix", "text_new": "{{about|an alternative version of a recorded work||Remix (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Typically a song or piece of music, which a person has edited and changed}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2008}}\n{{Expert needed|date=June 2018}}\n}}\nA '''remix''' is a piece of media which has been altered or contorted from its original state by adding, removing, and changing pieces of the item. A song, piece of artwork, books, video, poem, or photograph can all be remixes. The only characteristic of a remix is that it appropriates and changes other materials to create something new.\n\nMost commonly, remixes are a subset of [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] in music and song recordings. Songs may be remixed for a variety of reasons:\n* to adapt or revise a song for radio or [[nightclub]] play\n* to create a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] or [[surround sound]] version of a song where none was previously available\n* to improve the fidelity of an older song for which the original [[audio mastering|master]] has been lost or degraded\n* to alter a song to suit a specific [[music genre]] or [[radio format]]\n* to use some of the same materials, allowing the song to reach a different audience\n* to alter a song for artistic purposes\n* to provide additional versions of a song for use as [[bonus track]]s or for a [[B-side]], for example, in times when a CD single might carry a total of 4 tracks\n* to create a connection between a smaller artist and a more successful one, as was the case with [[Fatboy Slim]]'s remix of \"[[Brimful of Asha]]\" by [[Cornershop]]\n* to improve the first or demo mix of the song, generally to ensure a professional product.\n* to provide an alternative version of a song\n* to improve a song from its original state\nRemixes should not be confused with edits, which usually involve shortening a final stereo master for marketing or broadcasting purposes. Another distinction should be made between a remix, which recombines audio pieces from a recording to create an altered version of a song, and a [[Cover version|cover]]: a re-recording of someone else's song.\n\nWhile audio mixing is one of the most popular and recognized forms of remixing, this is not the only media form which is remixed in numerous examples. Literature, film, technology, and social systems can all be argued as a form of remix.<ref>''Everything is a Remix http://www.everythingisaremix.info/''</ref>\n\n== Roots of the remixing of sounds ==\n\nSince the beginnings of [[sound recording|recorded sound]] in the late 19th century, technology has enabled people to rearrange the normal listening experience.  With the advent of easily editable magnetic tape in the 1940s and 1950s and the subsequent development of [[multitrack recording]], such alterations became more common.  In those decades the experimental genre of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] used tape manipulation to create sound compositions. Less artistically lofty edits produced medleys or [[novelty record]]ings of various types.\n\nModern remixing had its roots in the dance hall culture of late-1960s/early-1970s [[Jamaica]]. The fluid evolution of music that encompassed [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]] was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt [[Audio track|track]]s to suit the tastes of their audience. Producers and engineers like Ruddy Redwood, [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] popularized stripped-down [[instrumental]] mixes (which they called \"versions\") of reggae tunes. At first, they simply dropped the vocal [[Audio track|track]]s, but soon more sophisticated effects were created, dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix, isolating and repeating [[hook (music)|hook]]s, and adding various effects like echo, [[reverberation]] and [[delay (audio effect)|delay]].  The German [[krautrock]] band [[Neu!]] also used other effects on side two of their album [[Neu! 2]] by manipulating their previously released single ''[[Super/Neuschnee]]'' multiple ways, utilizing playback at different turntable speeds or mangling by using a cassette recorder.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s, DJs in early discoth\u00e8ques were performing similar tricks with [[disco]] songs (using loops and [[tape editing|tape edits]]) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there. One noteworthy figure was [[Tom Moulton]] who invented the dance remix as we now know it.  Though not a DJ (a popular misconception), Moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a Fire Island dance club in the late 1960s.  His tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in New York City.  At first, Moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release<!-- examples? --> (\"I didn't do the remix, I did the mix\"\u2014Tom Moulton).  Eventually, he moved from being a \"fix it\" man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor.  Along the way, he invented the [[Break (music)|breakdown section]] and the [[12-inch single]] vinyl format. [[Walter Gibbons]] provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single (\"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\", by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]]). Contrary to popular belief, Gibbons did not mix the record. In fact his version was a [[re-edit]] of the original mix.  Moulton, Gibbons and their contemporaries ([[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Tee Scott]], and later [[Larry Levan]] and [[Shep Pettibone]]) at [[Salsoul Records]] proved to be the most influential group of remixers for the [[disco]] era.  The Salsoul catalog is seen (especially in the UK and Europe) as being the \"canon\" for the disco mixer's art form. Pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco to the House era. (He is certainly the most high-profile remixer to do so.) His contemporaries included [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian]].\n\nContemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s, the dub and disco [[remix culture]]s met through Jamaican immigrants to [[the Bronx]], energizing both and helping to create [[hip-hop music]]. Key figures included [[DJ Kool Herc]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]].  Cutting (alternating between duplicate copies of the same record) and [[scratching]] (manually moving the vinyl record beneath the turntable needle) became part of the culture, creating what ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine called \"real-time, live-action collage.\"  One of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track ''[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]'' by [[Herbie Hancock]], as remixed by [[Grand Mixer DXT|Grand Mixer D.ST]]. [[Malcolm McLaren]] and the creative team behind [[ZTT]] Records would feature the \"cut up\" style of hip hop on such records as \"[[Duck Rock]]\".\n\n==Remixing in electronic music==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Scott Brown - Elysium.ogg\n|title=Scott Brown - \"Elysium\" (1999)\n|description=29 second sample from [[Scott Brown (DJ)|Scott Brown]]'s \"Elysium\" - original.}}\nEarly pop remixes were fairly simple; in the 1980s, \"extended mixes\" of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl [[12-inch single]]s. These typically had a duration of six to seven minutes, and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] of instruments inserted, often after the second chorus; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end.  As the cost and availability of new technologies allowed, many of the bands who were involved in their own production (such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Erasure]], and [[Duran Duran]]) experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career; one of her early boyfriends was noted DJ [[John Jellybean Benitez]], who created several mixes of her work.\n\n[[Art of Noise]] took the remix styles to an extreme\u2014creating music entirely of [[sampling (music)|samples]].  They were among the first popular groups to truly harness the potential that had been unleashed by the [[synthesizer]]-based compositions of [[electronic music]]ians such as [[Kraftwerk]], Yellow Magic Orchestra, [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Jean Michel Jarre]].  Contemporaneous to Art of Noise was the seminal body of work by [[Yello]] (composed, arranged and mixed by [[Boris Blank (musician)|Boris Blank]]).  Primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds, Yello and Art of Noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase.  Others such as [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and the aforementioned Jarre (whose ''[[Zoolook]]'' was an epic usage of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[music sequencer|sequencing]]) were equally influential in this era.\n[[File:Melanie Chisholm byte.jpg|thumb|left|The main single of ''[[I Turn to You (Melanie C song)|I Turn to You]]'' by [[Melanie C]], was released as the \"Hex Hector Radio Mix\", for which [[Hex Hector]] won the 2001 [[Grammy]] as [[Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical|Remixer of the Year]].]]\nAfter the [[Second Summer of Love|rise of dance music]] in the late 1980s, a new form of remix was popularised, where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced, often with matching backing in the [[house music]] idiom. [[Jesse Saunders]], known as The Originator of House Music, was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music, entirely replacing the earlier track, then mixing back in the artist's original lyrics to make his remix. He introduced this technique for the first time with the [[Club Nouveau]] song \"It's a Cold, Cold World\", in May of 1988.  Another clear example of this approach is [[Roberta Flack]]'s 1989 ballad \"Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)\", which Chicago House great Steve \"Silk\" Hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental [[Audio track|track]]s and substituting a minimalist, sequenced \"[[Audio track|track]]\" to underpin her vocal delivery.  The art of the remix gradually evolved, and soon more [[avant-garde musicians|avant-garde artists]] such as [[Aphex Twin]] were creating more experimental remixes of songs (relying on the groundwork of Cabaret Voltaire and the others), which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or \"danceability\", but were created for \"art's sake\".\n\nIn the 1990s, with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]], an unsolicited, unofficial (and often legally dubious) remix created by \"underground remixers\" who edit two or more recordings (often of wildly different songs) together. [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] is perhaps the most famous of this movement, creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own.  Underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated [[Audio track|track]]s such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public. Some artists (such as [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes. Other artists, such as [[Erasure]], have included remix software in their officially released singles, enabling almost infinite permutations of remixes by users. The band has also presided over remix competitions for their releases, selecting their favourite fan-created remix to appear on later official releases.\n\nRemixing has become prevalent in heavily synthesized electronic and experimental music circles. Many of the people who create cutting-edge music in such genres as [[synthpop]] and [[aggrotech]] are solo artists or pairs. They will often use remixers to help them with skills or equipment that they do not have. Artists such as [[Chicago]]-based Delobbo, [[Dallas]]-based [[LehtMoJoe]], and Russian [[DJ Ram]], who has worked with [[t.A.T.u.]], are sought out for their remixing skill and have impressive lists of contributions. It is not uncommon for industrial bands to release albums that have remixes as half of the songs. Indeed, there have been popular singles that have been expanded to an entire album of remixes by other well-known artists.<!-- examples here -->\n\nSome industrial groups allow, and often encourage, their fans to remix their music, notably [[Nine Inch Nails]], whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[GarageBand]] software.  Some artists have started releasing their songs in the [[U-MYX]] format, which allows buyers to mix songs and share them on the U-MYX website.\n\nThe main single of ''[[I Turn to You (Melanie C song)|I Turn to You]]'' by [[Melanie C]], was released as the \"Hex Hector Radio Mix\", for which [[Hex Hector]] won the 2001 [[Grammy]] as [[Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical|Remixer of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/04/entertainment/ca-8072/13|title=Grammys Cast a Wider Net Than Usual|page=13|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|accessdate=April 29, 2011|date=January 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\nSome radio stations, suck as the UK's {{cite magazine|url=https://www.friskradio.com/articles/frisk-best-radio-station-for-remixes|title=Frisk Radio}} make extensive use of Remixes in their formats to create a hotter, more up-beat sound than their market rivals.\n\n==Remixing in popular music==\nRecent technology allows for easier remixing, leading to a rise in its use in the music industry.<ref>{{Citation|title=How sampling transformed music|author=Mark Ronson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3TF-hI7zKc|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> It can be done legally, but there have been numerous disputes over rights to [[Sampling (music)|samples]] used in remixed songs.

Such remixes often include \"featured\" artists, adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix. The remix is also widely used in [[hip hop music|hip hop and rap music]]. An [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists. It usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however they may be arranged in a different order than they originally were.\n\nIn 1988, [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]]'s art-rock song \"I Want Your (Hands On Me)\" was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition (the original contains a tight, grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike Chic's work).\n[[File: MariahGMA.jpg|thumb|upright|Carey is credited for introducing R&B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs with her remix of \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\" featuring [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]].]]\nIn the early 1990s, [[Mariah Carey]] became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version, and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung, e.g. \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\". Some artists would contribute new or additional vocals for the different versions of their songs.

Kelly]], who recorded two different versions of \"[[Ignition (song)|Ignition]]\" for his 2003 album ''[[Chocolate Factory]]''.  The song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version (accompanied by the line \"Now usually I don't do this, but uh, go ahead on, break em' off with a little preview of the remix.\"). In addition, the original version's beginning line \"You remind me of something/I just can't think of what it is\" is actually [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] from an older Kelly song, \"[[You Remind Me of Something]]\". Kelly later revealed that he actually wrote \"Ignition (remix)\" before the purported original version of \"Ignition\", and created the purported original so that the chorus lyric in his alleged remix would make sense.<ref>https://www.gq.com/story/r-kelly-confessions</ref>  Madonna's ''[[I'm Breathless]]'' featured a remix of \"[[Now I'm Following You]]\" that was used to segue from the original to \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\" so that the latter could be added to the set without jarring the listener.\n\nIn 2015, EDM artist [[Deadmau5]], who worked with Jay-Z's Roc Nation, tried to sue his former manager for remixing his songs without permission, claiming that he gave his manager the go-ahead to use his work for some remixes, but not others. Deadmau5 wanted reimbursement for the remixes his manager made after they had severed ties, because he claimed it was his \u201cmoral right\u201d to turn these future remixing opportunities away if he had wanted to. The two parties reached an agreement in 2016 that kept [[Play Records]] from making any new remixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/deadmau5-sues-remixes-mashups-834630|title=Deadmau5 Sues Over Remixes and Mashups|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/deadmau5_reaches_settlement_with_play_records_over_unauthorized_remixes|title=Deadmau5 Reaches Settlement with Play Records over Unauthorized Remixes|website=exclaim.ca}}</ref> \n\t\n[[50 Cent]] tried to sue rapper [[Rick Ross]] in October 2018 for remixing his \"[[In da Club]]\" beat, due to their publicized feud. However, a judge threw out the lawsuit claiming that 50 Cent did not have copyright on the beat, but rather it belonged to Shady/Aftermath Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2018/10/04/federal-judge-tosses-rapper-50-cents-in-da-club-remix-suit-appeal-expected/|title=Federal Judge Tosses Rapper 50 Cent's 'In Da Club' Remix Suit, Appeal Expected|first1=Robert Storace &#124;|last1=October 04|first2=2018 at 06:20|last2=PM|website=Connecticut Law Tribune}}</ref>\n\nMany hip-hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop/R&B singer to add more of an urban, rap edge to one of their slower songs, or from a rapper's desire to gain more pop appeal by collaborating with an R&B singer.  Remixes can boost popularity of the original versions of songs.\n\nThanks to a combination of guest raps, re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks, some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals. An example is the remix of \"[[Ain't It Funny]]\" by [[Jennifer Lopez]], which has little in common with the original recording apart from the title.\n\nSlow [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] and R&B songs can be remixed by [[techno]] producers and DJs in order to give the song appeal to the [[Nightclub|club]] scene and to [[Mainstream urban|urban]] radio.  Conversely, a more uptempo number can be mellowed to give it \"[[quiet storm]]\" appeal.  [[Frankie Knuckles]] saddled both markets with his Def Classic Mixes, often slowing the tempo slightly as he removed ornamental elements to soften the \"attack\" of a dancefloor filler.  These remixes proved hugely influential, notably [[Lisa Stansfield]]'s classic single \"[[Change (Lisa Stansfield song)|Change]]\" would be aired by urban radio in the Knuckles version, which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, the record's producers.\nIn the age of social media, anybody can make and upload a remix. The most popular apps for doing this are [[Instagram]] and [[Youtube]]. Many famous artists of today began by making remixes and relifts to popular music. Such artists include [[Dua Lipa]], [[Adi]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and [[R3hab]], to name a few.\n\n==Broader context==\n\nA remix may also refer to a non-linear re-interpretation of a given work or media other than audio such as a hybridizing process combining fragments of various works.  The process of combining and re-contextualizing will often produce unique results independent of the intentions and vision of the original designer/artist.  Thus the concept of a remix can be applied to visual or video arts, and even things farther afield. [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s disjointed novel ''[[House of Leaves]]'' has been compared by some to the remix concept.\n\n==Remix in literature==\n{{main|Cut-up technique}}\nA remix in literature is an alternative version of a text. [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] developed by [[Brion Gysin]] to remix language in the 1960s.<ref>Interviewed by ''[[The Paris Review]]'', Burroughs explained the following: \"A friend, Brion Gysin, an American poet and painter, who has lived in Europe for thirty years, was, as far as I know, the first to create cut-ups. His cut-up poem, ''Minutes to Go'', was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of ''Naked Lunch''. I became interested in the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' was the first great cut-up collage, and [[Tristan Tzara]] had done a bit along the same lines. [[Dos Passos]] used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in ''[[U.S.A. trilogy|USA]]''. I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done.\" Cf. Knickerbocker, Conrad, Williams S. Burroughs, 'The Paris Review Interview with William S. Burroughs' in ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 263.</ref> Various textual sources (including his own) would be cut literally into pieces with scissors, rearranged on a page, and pasted to form new sentences, new ideas, new stories, and new ways of thinking about words.\n\n\"The Soft Machine\" (1961) is a famous example of an early novel by Burroughs based on the cut-up technique. Remixing of literature and language is also apparent in ''Pixel Juice'' (2000) by [[Jeff Noon]] who later explained using different methods for this process with ''Cobralingus'' (2001).\n\n==Remix in art==\n\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}\n\nA remix in art often takes multiple perspectives upon the same theme. An artist takes an original work of art and adds their own take on the piece creating something completely different while still leaving traces of the original work. It is essentially a reworked abstraction of the original work while still holding remnants of the original piece while still letting the true meanings of the original piece shine through. Famous examples include ''[[Marilyn Diptych|The Marilyn Diptych]]'' by Andy Warhol (modifies colors and styles of one image), and ''[[The Weeping Woman]]'' by Pablo Picasso, (merges various angles of perspective into one view). Some of Picasso's other famous paintings also incorporate parts of his life, such as his love affairs, into his paintings.  For example, his painting ''Les Trois Danseuses'', or ''The Three Dancers'', is about a love triangle.\n\nOther types of remixes in art are parodies. A parody in contemporary usage, is a work created to mock, comment on, or make fun at an original work, its subject, author, style, or some other target, by means of humorous, satiric or ironic imitation. They can be found all throughout art and culture from literature to animation. A famous song parody artist is ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'', and current television shows are filled with parodies such as [[South Park]], [[Family Guy]], and [[The Simpsons]].\n\nThe internet has allowed for art to be remixed quite easily, as evidenced by sites like memgenerator.net (provides pictorial template upon which any words may be written by various anonymous users), and Dan Walsh's Garfieldminusgarfield.net<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://garfieldminusgarfield.net/?og=1|title=garfield minus garfield|website=garfieldminusgarfield.net}}</ref>(removes the main character from various original strips by Garfield creator Jim Davis).\n\n\"A feminist remix is a creative resistance and cultural production that talks back to patriarchy by reworking patriarchal hierarchical systems privileging men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keifer-Boyd|first1=Karen|last2=Liao|first2=Christen|title=Feminism. In Keywords in Remix Studies.|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York:NY|pages=147\u2013157}}</ref>\nExamples include Barbara Kruger's ''You are not yourself'' (1982), ''We are not what we seem'' (1988), and ''Your body is a battleground'' (1989)\n[[Barbara Kruger]], Orlan's (1994) ''Self-Hybridizations'' [[Orlan]], Evelin Stermitz's remix, ''Women at War'' (2010), and ''Distaff'' [Ain\u2019t I Redux] (2008) by artist Sian Amoy.\n\n==Remix in media and consumer products==\n\nIn recent years the concept of the remix has been applied analogously to other [[Mass media|media]] and products. In 2001, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] television program ''[[Jaaaaam]]'' was produced as a remix of the sketches from the [[comedy]] show ''Jam''. In 2003 [[The Coca-Cola Company]] released a new version of their [[soft drink]] [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] with [[tropical]] flavors under the name [[Sprite Remix]].\n\nRemix production is now often involved in media production as a form of parody. ''[[Scary Movie]]'' series is famous for its comic remix of various well-known horror movies such as Ring, Scream, and Saw. This form of remix is also used in advertisements, creating parodies of famous movies, TV series, etc. For example, [[McDonald's]] published a commercial poster that parodied the movie Dark Knight.\n\nIn 1995, [[Sega]] released ''Virtua Fighter Remix'' (\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3000\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9/B\u0101chafait\u0101 rimikkusu) as an update to, just months after of ''Virtua Fighter'' release on the Sega Saturn.\n\n''Virtua Fighter'' had been released on the Saturn in a less-than-impressive state. Sega had attempted to make an accurate port of the Sega Model 1 arcade version, and therefore chose to use untextured models and the soundtrack from the arcade machine. However, as the Saturn was incapable of rendering as many polygons on screen as Model 1 hardware, characters looked noticeably worse. Many claim it to be even worse than the Sega 32X version, thanks to the added CD loading time.\n\n''Virtua Fighter Remix'' was created to address many of these flaws. Models have a slightly higher polygon count (though still less than the Model 1 version); they are also texture-mapped, leading to a much more modern-looking game that could effectively compete with the PlayStation. The game also allows players to use the original flat-shaded models.\n\nIn the west, a CG Portrait Collection Disc was also included in the Saturn bundle. North American owners would get ''Virtua Fighter Remix'' for free if they registered their Saturns, while Japanese customers would later receive a SegaNet compatible version. Sega would also bring Virtua Fighter Remix to Sega Titan Video arcade hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://segaretro.org/Virtua_Fighter_Remix|title=Virtua Fighter Remix|work=Sega Retro}}</ref>\n\n==Copyright implications==\n\nBecause remixes may borrow heavily from an existing piece of music (possibly more than one), the issue of intellectual property becomes a concern. The most important question is whether a remixer is free to redistribute his or her work, or whether the remix falls under the category of a [[derivative work]] according to, for example, United States copyright law. Of note are open questions concerning the legality of visual works, like the art form of [[collage]], which can be plagued with licensing issues.\n\nThere are two obvious extremes with regard to derivative works. If the song is substantively dissimilar in form (for example, it might only borrow a motif which is modified, and be completely different in all other respects), then it may not necessarily be a derivative work (depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were). On the other hand, if the remixer only changes a few things (for example, the instrument and tempo), then it is clearly a derivative work and subject to the copyrights of the original work's copyright holder.\n\nThe [[Creative Commons]] is a non-profit organization that allows the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools and explicitly aims for enabling a [[Remix culture]].<ref name=\"remixbook\"/> They created a website that allows artists to share their work with other users, giving them the ability to share, use, or build upon their work, under the [[Creative Commons license]]. The artist can limit the copyright to specific users for specific purposes, while protecting the users and the artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/|title=What we do}}</ref>\n\nThe exclusive rights of the copyright owner over acts such as reproduction/copying, communication, adaptation and performance \u2013 unless licensed openly \u2013 by their very nature reduce the ability to negotiate copyright material without permission.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ss 31|pages=85\u201388}}</ref>\nRemixes will inevitably encounter legal problems when the whole or a substantial part of the original material has been reproduced, copied, communicated, adapted or performed \u2013 unless a permission has been given in advance through a voluntary open content license like a Creative Commons license, there is fair dealing involved (the scope of which is extraordinarily narrow), a statutory license exists, or permission has been sought and obtained from the copyright owner. Generally, the courts consider what will amount to a substantial part by reference to its quality, as opposed to quantity and the importance the part taken bears in relation to the work as whole.<ref>Mashups, Remix, and Copyright Law</ref>\n\nThere are proposed theories of reform regarding the copyright law and remixes. Nicolas Suzor believes that copyright law should be reformed in such a manner as to allow certain reuses of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner where those derivatives are highly transformative and do not impact upon the primary market of the copyright owner. There certainly appears to be a strong argument that non commercial derivatives, which do not compete with the market for the original material, should be afforded some defense to copyright actions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nicolas Suzor|title=Transformative Use of Copyright Material|journal=LLM Thesis|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|year=2006|url=http://nic.suzor.com/publications}}</ref>\n\n[[Stanford Law]] professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] believes that for the first time in history creativity by default is subject to regulation because of two architectural features. First, cultural objects or products created digitally can be easily copied, and secondly, the default copyright law requires the permission of the owner. The result is that one needs the permission of the copyright owner to engage in mashups or acts of remixing. Lessig believes that the key to mashups and remix is \"education \u2013 not about framing or law \u2013 but rather what you can do with technology, and then the law will catch up\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4239/1/4239.pdf|title=Mashups, Remix, and Copyright Law}}</ref> \nHe believes that trade associations \u2013 like mashup guilds \u2013 that survey practices and publish reports to establish norm or reasonable behaviours in the context of the community would be useful in establishing fair use parameters. Lessig also \nbelieves that Creative Commons and other licences, such as the [[GNU General Public Licence]] are important mechanisms which mashup and remix artists can use to mitigate the impact of copyright law.<ref name=\"remixbook\">{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |title=Remix|year=2008|publisher=[[Penguin Press]]}}</ref> Lessig laid out his ideas in a book called [[Remix (book)|\"Remix\"]] which is itself free to remix under a [[CC BY-NC]] [[Creative commons license|license]].<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig\u2019s Remix, Then Remix It] on [[wired.com]]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054011/http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/remix.htm remix] on [[Bloomsbury Academic]] (2008, archived)</ref>\n\nThe [[Fair Use]] agreement allows users to use copyrighted materials without asking the permission of the original creator (section 107 of the federal copyright law). Within this agreement, the copyrighted material that is borrowed must be used under specific government regulations. Material borrowed falls under fair use depending on the amount of original content used, the nature of the content, the purpose of the borrowed content, and the effect the borrowed content has on an audience.

A song, piece of artwork, books, video, poem, or photograph can all be remixes. The only characteristic of a remix is that it appropriates and changes other materials to create something new.\n\nMost commonly, remixes are a subset of [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] in music and song recordings. Songs may be remixed for a variety of reasons:\n* to adapt or revise a song for radio or [[nightclub]] play\n* to create a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] or [[surround sound]] version of a song where none was previously available\n* to improve the fidelity of an older song for which the original [[audio mastering|master]] has been lost or degraded\n* to alter a song to suit a specific [[music genre]] or [[radio format]]\n* to use some of the same materials, allowing the song to reach a different audience\n* to alter a song for artistic purposes\n* to provide additional versions of a song for use as [[bonus track]]s or for a [[B-side]], for example, in times when a CD single might carry a total of 4 tracks\n* to create a connection between a smaller artist and a more successful one, as was the case with [[Fatboy Slim]]'s remix of \"[[Brimful of Asha]]\" by [[Cornershop]]\n* to improve the first or demo mix of the song, generally to ensure a professional product.\n* to provide an alternative version of a song\n* to improve a song from its original state\nRemixes should not be confused with edits, which usually involve shortening a final stereo master for marketing or broadcasting purposes. Another distinction should be made between a remix, which recombines audio pieces from a recording to create an altered version of a song, and a [[Cover version|cover]]: a re-recording of someone else's song.\n\nWhile audio mixing is one of the most popular and recognized forms of remixing, this is not the only media form which is remixed in numerous examples. Literature, film, technology, and social systems can all be argued as a form of remix.<ref>''Everything is a Remix http://www.everythingisaremix.info/''</ref>\n\n== Roots of the remixing of sounds ==\n\nSince the beginnings of [[sound recording|recorded sound]] in the late 19th century, technology has enabled people to rearrange the normal listening experience.  With the advent of easily editable magnetic tape in the 1940s and 1950s and the subsequent development of [[multitrack recording]], such alterations became more common.  In those decades the experimental genre of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] used tape manipulation to create sound compositions. Less artistically lofty edits produced medleys or [[novelty record]]ings of various types.\n\nModern remixing had its roots in the dance hall culture of late-1960s/early-1970s [[Jamaica]]. The fluid evolution of music that encompassed [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]] was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt [[Audio track|track]]s to suit the tastes of their audience. Producers and engineers like Ruddy Redwood, [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] popularized stripped-down [[instrumental]] mixes (which they called \"versions\") of reggae tunes. At first, they simply dropped the vocal [[Audio track|track]]s, but soon more sophisticated effects were created, dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix, isolating and repeating [[hook (music)|hook]]s, and adding various effects like echo, [[reverberation]] and [[delay (audio effect)|delay]].  The German [[krautrock]] band [[Neu!]] also used other effects on side two of their album [[Neu! 2]] by manipulating their previously released single ''[[Super/Neuschnee]]'' multiple ways, utilizing playback at different turntable speeds or mangling by using a cassette recorder.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s, DJs in early discoth\u00e8ques were performing similar tricks with [[disco]] songs (using loops and [[tape editing|tape edits]]) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there. One noteworthy figure was [[Tom Moulton]] who invented the dance remix as we now know it.  Though not a DJ (a popular misconception), Moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a Fire Island dance club in the late 1960s.  His tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in New York City.  At first, Moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release<!-- examples? --> (\"I didn't do the remix, I did the mix\"\u2014Tom Moulton).  Eventually, he moved from being a \"fix it\" man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor.  Along the way, he invented the [[Break (music)|breakdown section]] and the [[12-inch single]] vinyl format. [[Walter Gibbons]] provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single (\"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\", by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]]). Contrary to popular belief, Gibbons did not mix the record. In fact his version was a [[re-edit]] of the original mix.  Moulton, Gibbons and their contemporaries ([[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Tee Scott]], and later [[Larry Levan]] and [[Shep Pettibone]]) at [[Salsoul Records]] proved to be the most influential group of remixers for the [[disco]] era.  The Salsoul catalog is seen (especially in the UK and Europe) as being the \"canon\" for the disco mixer's art form. Pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco to the House era. (He is certainly the most high-profile remixer to do so.) His contemporaries included [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian]].\n\nContemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s, the dub and disco [[remix culture]]s met through Jamaican immigrants to [[the Bronx]], energizing both and helping to create [[hip-hop music]]. Key figures included [[DJ Kool Herc]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]].  Cutting (alternating between duplicate copies of the same record) and [[scratching]] (manually moving the vinyl record beneath the turntable needle) became part of the culture, creating what ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine called \"real-time, live-action collage.\"  One of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track ''[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]'' by [[Herbie Hancock]], as remixed by [[Grand Mixer DXT|Grand Mixer D.ST]]. [[Malcolm McLaren]] and the creative team behind [[ZTT]] Records would feature the \"cut up\" style of hip hop on such records as \"[[Duck Rock]]\".\n\n==Remixing in electronic music==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Scott Brown - Elysium.ogg\n|title=Scott Brown - \"Elysium\" (1999)\n|description=29 second sample from [[Scott Brown (DJ)|Scott Brown]]'s \"Elysium\" - original.}}\nEarly pop remixes were fairly simple; in the 1980s, \"extended mixes\" of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl [[12-inch single]]s. These typically had a duration of six to seven minutes, and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] of instruments inserted, often after the second chorus; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end.  As the cost and availability of new technologies allowed, many of the bands who were involved in their own production (such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Erasure]], and [[Duran Duran]]) experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career; one of her early boyfriends was noted DJ [[John Jellybean Benitez]], who created several mixes of her work.\n\n[[Art of Noise]] took the remix styles to an extreme\u2014creating music entirely of [[sampling (music)|samples]].  They were among the first popular groups to truly harness the potential that had been unleashed by the [[synthesizer]]-based compositions of [[electronic music]]ians such as [[Kraftwerk]], Yellow Magic Orchestra, [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Jean Michel Jarre]].  Contemporaneous to Art of Noise was the seminal body of work by [[Yello]] (composed, arranged and mixed by [[Boris Blank (musician)|Boris Blank]]).  Primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds, Yello and Art of Noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase.  Others such as [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and the aforementioned Jarre (whose ''[[Zoolook]]'' was an epic usage of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[music sequencer|sequencing]]) were equally influential in this era.\n[[File:Melanie Chisholm byte.jpg|thumb|left|The main single of ''[[I Turn to You (Melanie C song)|I Turn to You]]'' by [[Melanie C]], was released as the \"Hex Hector Radio Mix\", for which [[Hex Hector]] won the 2001 [[Grammy]] as [[Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical|Remixer of the Year]].]]\nAfter the [[Second Summer of Love|rise of dance music]] in the late 1980s, a new form of remix was popularised, where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced, often with matching backing in the [[house music]] idiom. [[Jesse Saunders]], known as The Originator of House Music, was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music, entirely replacing the earlier track, then mixing back in the artist's original lyrics to make his remix. He introduced this technique for the first time with the [[Club Nouvea]] song \"It's a Cold, Cold World\", in May of 1988.  Another clear example of this approach is [[Roberta Flack]]'s 1989 ballad \"Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)\", which Chicago House great Steve \"Silk\" Hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental [[Audio track|track]]s and substituting a minimalist, sequenced \"[[Audio track|track]]\" to underpin her vocal delivery.  The art of the remix gradually evolved, and soon more [[avant-garde musicians|avant-garde artists]] such as [[Aphex Twin]] were creating more experimental remixes of songs (relying on the groundwork of Cabaret Voltaire and the others), which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or \"danceability\", but were created for \"art's sake\".\n\nIn the 1990s, with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]], an unsolicited, unofficial (and often legally dubious) remix created by \"underground remixers\" who edit two or more recordings (often of wildly different songs) together. [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] is perhaps the most famous of this movement, creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own.  Underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated [[Audio track|track]]s such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public. Some artists (such as [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes. Other artists, such as [[Erasure]], have included remix software in their officially released singles, enabling almost infinite permutations of remixes by users. The band has also presided over remix competitions for their releases, selecting their favourite fan-created remix to appear on later official releases.\n\nRemixing has become prevalent in heavily synthesized electronic and experimental music circles. Many of the people who create cutting-edge music in such genres as [[synthpop]] and [[aggrotech]] are solo artists or pairs. They will often use remixers to help them with skills or equipment that they do not have. Artists such as [[Chicago]]-based Delobbo, [[Dallas]]-based [[LehtMoJoe]], and Russian [[DJ Ram]], who has worked with [[t.A.T.u.]], are sought out for their remixing skill and have impressive lists of contributions. It is not uncommon for industrial bands to release albums that have remixes as half of the songs. Indeed, there have been popular singles that have been expanded to an entire album of remixes by other well-known artists.<!-- examples here -->\n\nSome industrial groups allow, and often encourage, their fans to remix their music, notably [[Nine Inch Nails]], whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[GarageBand]] software.  Some artists have started releasing their songs in the [[U-MYX]] format, which allows buyers to mix songs and share them on the U-MYX website.\n\nThe main single of ''[[I Turn to You (Melanie C song)|I Turn to You]]'' by [[Melanie C]], was released as the \"Hex Hector Radio Mix\", for which [[Hex Hector]] won the 2001 [[Grammy]] as [[Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical|Remixer of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/04/entertainment/ca-8072/13|title=Grammys Cast a Wider Net Than Usual|page=13|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|accessdate=April 29, 2011|date=January 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\nSome radio stations, suck as the UK's {{cite magazine|url=https://www.friskradio.com/articles/frisk-best-radio-station-for-remixes|title=Frisk Radio}} make extensive use of Remixes in their formats to create a hotter, more up-beat sound than their market rivals.\n\n==Remixing in popular music==\nRecent technology allows for easier remixing, leading to a rise in its use in the music industry.<ref>{{Citation|title=How sampling transformed music|author=Mark Ronson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3TF-hI7zKc|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> It can be done legally, but there have been numerous disputes over rights to [[Sampling (music)|samples]] used in remixed songs. Many famous artists have been involved in remix disputes. In 2015, [[Jay-Z]] went to trial over a dispute about his use of a sample from \"Khosara Khosara\", a composition by Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdy in his song \"[[Big Pimpin']]\". Osama Fahmy, a nephew of Hamdy, argued that while Jay-Z had the \u201ceconomic rights\u201d to use the song, he did not have the \u201cmoral rights\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/big-pimpin-trial-jay-z-832532|title=\"Big Pimpin' \" Trial: Jay Z Song Stirs International Copyright Law Debate|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\t\nRemixes have become the norm in contemporary [[dance music]], giving one song the ability to appeal across many different musical genres or dance venues. Such remixes often include \"featured\" artists, adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix. The remix is also widely used in [[hip hop music|hip hop and rap music]]. An [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists. It usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however they may be arranged in a different order than they originally were.\n\nIn 1988, [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]]'s art-rock song \"I Want Your (Hands On Me)\" was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition (the original contains a tight, grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike Chic's work).\n[[File: MariahGMA.jpg|thumb|upright|Carey is credited for introducing R&B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs with her remix of \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\" featuring [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]].]]\nIn the early 1990s, [[Mariah Carey]] became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version, and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung, e.g. \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\".

However, a judge threw out the lawsuit claiming that 50 Cent did not have copyright on the beat, but rather it belonged to Shady/Aftermath Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2018/10/04/federal-judge-tosses-rapper-50-cents-in-da-club-remix-suit-appeal-expected/|title=Federal Judge Tosses Rapper 50 Cent's 'In Da Club' Remix Suit, Appeal Expected|first1=Robert Storace &#124;|last1=October 04|first2=2018 at 06:20|last2=PM|website=Connecticut Law Tribune}}</ref>\n\nMany hip-hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop/R&B singer to add more of an urban, rap edge to one of their slower songs, or from a rapper's desire to gain more pop appeal by collaborating with an R&B singer.  Remixes can boost popularity of the original versions of songs.\n\nThanks to a combination of guest raps, re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks, some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals. An example is the remix of \"[[Ain't It Funny]]\" by [[Jennifer Lopez]], which has little in common with the original recording apart from the title.\n\nSlow [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] and R&B songs can be remixed by [[techno]] producers and DJs in order to give the song appeal to the [[Nightclub|club]] scene and to [[Mainstream urban|urban]] radio.  Conversely, a more uptempo number can be mellowed to give it \"[[quiet storm]]\" appeal.  [[Frankie Knuckles]] saddled both markets with his Def Classic Mixes, often slowing the tempo slightly as he removed ornamental elements to soften the \"attack\" of a dancefloor filler.  These remixes proved hugely influential, notably [[Lisa Stansfield]]'s classic single \"[[Change (Lisa Stansfield song)|Change]]\" would be aired by urban radio in the Knuckles version, which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, the record's producers.\nIn the age of social media, anybody can make and upload a remix. The most popular apps for doing this are [[Instagram]] and [[Youtube]]. Many famous artists of today began by making remixes and relifts to popular music. Such artists include [[Dua Lipa]], [[Adi]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and [[R3hab]], to name a few.\n\n==Broader context==\n\nA remix may also refer to a non-linear re-interpretation of a given work or media other than audio such as a hybridizing process combining fragments of various works.  The process of combining and re-contextualizing will often produce unique results independent of the intentions and vision of the original designer/artist.  Thus the concept of a remix can be applied to visual or video arts, and even things farther afield. [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s disjointed novel ''[[House of Leaves]]'' has been compared by some to the remix concept.\n\n==Remix in literature==\n{{main|Cut-up technique}}\nA remix in literature is an alternative version of a text. [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] developed by [[Brion Gysin]] to remix language in the 1960s.<ref>Interviewed by ''[[The Paris Review]]'', Burroughs explained the following: \"A friend, Brion Gysin, an American poet and painter, who has lived in Europe for thirty years, was, as far as I know, the first to create cut-ups. His cut-up poem, ''Minutes to Go'', was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of ''Naked Lunch''. I became interested in the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' was the first great cut-up collage, and [[Tristan Tzara]] had done a bit along the same lines. [[Dos Passos]] used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in ''[[U.S.A. trilogy|USA]]''. I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done.\" Cf. Knickerbocker, Conrad, Williams S. Burroughs, 'The Paris Review Interview with William S. Burroughs' in ''A Williams Burroughs Reader'', ed. John Calder (London: Picador, 1982), p. 263.</ref> Various textual sources (including his own) would be cut literally into pieces with scissors, rearranged on a page, and pasted to form new sentences, new ideas, new stories, and new ways of thinking about words.\n\n\"The Soft Machine\" (1961) is a famous example of an early novel by Burroughs based on the cut-up technique. Remixing of literature and language is also apparent in ''Pixel Juice'' (2000) by [[Jeff Noon]] who later explained using different methods for this process with ''Cobralingus'' (2001).\n\n==Remix in art==\n\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}\n\nA remix in art often takes multiple perspectives upon the same theme. An artist takes an original work of art and adds their own take on the piece creating something completely different while still leaving traces of the original work. It is essentially a reworked abstraction of the original work while still holding remnants of the original piece while still letting the true meanings of the original piece shine through. Famous examples include ''[[Marilyn Diptych|The Marilyn Diptych]]'' by Andy Warhol (modifies colors and styles of one image), and ''[[The Weeping Woman]]'' by Pablo Picasso, (merges various angles of perspective into one view). Some of Picasso's other famous paintings also incorporate parts of his life, such as his love affairs, into his paintings.  For example, his painting ''Les Trois Danseuses'', or ''The Three Dancers'', is about a love triangle.\n\nOther types of remixes in art are parodies. A parody in contemporary usage, is a work created to mock, comment on, or make fun at an original work, its subject, author, style, or some other target, by means of humorous, satiric or ironic imitation. They can be found all throughout art and culture from literature to animation. A famous song parody artist is ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'', and current television shows are filled with parodies such as [[South Park]], [[Family Guy]], and [[The Simpsons]].\n\nThe internet has allowed for art to be remixed quite easily, as evidenced by sites like memgenerator.net (provides pictorial template upon which any words may be written by various anonymous users), and Dan Walsh's Garfieldminusgarfield.net<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://garfieldminusgarfield.net/?og=1|title=garfield minus garfield|website=garfieldminusgarfield.net}}</ref>(removes the main character from various original strips by Garfield creator Jim Davis).\n\n\"A feminist remix is a creative resistance and cultural production that talks back to patriarchy by reworking patriarchal hierarchical systems privileging men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keifer-Boyd|first1=Karen|last2=Liao|first2=Christen|title=Feminism. In Keywords in Remix Studies.|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York:NY|pages=147\u2013157}}</ref>\nExamples include Barbara Kruger's ''You are not yourself'' (1982), ''We are not what we seem'' (1988), and ''Your body is a battleground'' (1989)\n[[Barbara Kruger]], Orlan's (1994) ''Self-Hybridizations'' [[Orlan]], Evelin Stermitz's remix, ''Women at War'' (2010), and ''Distaff'' [Ain\u2019t I Redux] (2008) by artist Sian Amoy.\n\n==Remix in media and consumer products==\n\nIn recent years the concept of the remix has been applied analogously to other [[Mass media|media]] and products. In 2001, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] television program ''[[Jaaaaam]]'' was produced as a remix of the sketches from the [[comedy]] show ''Jam''. In 2003 [[The Coca-Cola Company]] released a new version of their [[soft drink]] [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] with [[tropical]] flavors under the name [[Sprite Remix]].\n\nRemix production is now often involved in media production as a form of parody. ''[[Scary Movie]]'' series is famous for its comic remix of various well-known horror movies such as Ring, Scream, and Saw. This form of remix is also used in advertisements, creating parodies of famous movies, TV series, etc. For example, [[McDonald's]] published a commercial poster that parodied the movie Dark Knight.\n\nIn 1995, [[Sega]] released ''Virtua Fighter Remix'' (\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3000\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9/B\u0101chafait\u0101 rimikkusu) as an update to, just months after of ''Virtua Fighter'' release on the Sega Saturn.\n\n''Virtua Fighter'' had been released on the Saturn in a less-than-impressive state. Sega had attempted to make an accurate port of the Sega Model 1 arcade version, and therefore chose to use untextured models and the soundtrack from the arcade machine. However, as the Saturn was incapable of rendering as many polygons on screen as Model 1 hardware, characters looked noticeably worse. Many claim it to be even worse than the Sega 32X version, thanks to the added CD loading time.\n\n''Virtua Fighter Remix'' was created to address many of these flaws. Models have a slightly higher polygon count (though still less than the Model 1 version); they are also texture-mapped, leading to a much more modern-looking game that could effectively compete with the PlayStation. The game also allows players to use the original flat-shaded models.\n\nIn the west, a CG Portrait Collection Disc was also included in the Saturn bundle. North American owners would get ''Virtua Fighter Remix'' for free if they registered their Saturns, while Japanese customers would later receive a SegaNet compatible version. Sega would also bring Virtua Fighter Remix to Sega Titan Video arcade hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://segaretro.org/Virtua_Fighter_Remix|title=Virtua Fighter Remix|work=Sega Retro}}</ref>\n\n==Copyright implications==\n\nBecause remixes may borrow heavily from an existing piece of music (possibly more than one), the issue of intellectual property becomes a concern. The most important question is whether a remixer is free to redistribute his or her work, or whether the remix falls under the category of a [[derivative work]] according to, for example, United States copyright law. Of note are open questions concerning the legality of visual works, like the art form of [[collage]], which can be plagued with licensing issues.\n\nThere are two obvious extremes with regard to derivative works. If the song is substantively dissimilar in form (for example, it might only borrow a motif which is modified, and be completely different in all other respects), then it may not necessarily be a derivative work (depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were). On the other hand, if the remixer only changes a few things (for example, the instrument and tempo), then it is clearly a derivative work and subject to the copyrights of the original work's copyright holder.\n\nThe [[Creative Commons]] is a non-profit organization that allows the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools and explicitly aims for enabling a [[Remix culture]].<ref name=\"remixbook\"/> They created a website that allows artists to share their work with other users, giving them the ability to share, use, or build upon their work, under the [[Creative Commons license]]. The artist can limit the copyright to specific users for specific purposes, while protecting the users and the artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/|title=What we do}}</ref>\n\nThe exclusive rights of the copyright owner over acts such as reproduction/copying, communication, adaptation and performance \u2013 unless licensed openly \u2013 by their very nature reduce the ability to negotiate copyright material without permission.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ss 31|pages=85\u201388}}</ref>\nRemixes will inevitably encounter legal problems when the whole or a substantial part of the original material has been reproduced, copied, communicated, adapted or performed \u2013 unless a permission has been given in advance through a voluntary open content license like a Creative Commons license, there is fair dealing involved (the scope of which is extraordinarily narrow), a statutory license exists, or permission has been sought and obtained from the copyright owner. Generally, the courts consider what will amount to a substantial part by reference to its quality, as opposed to quantity and the importance the part taken bears in relation to the work as whole.<ref>Mashups, Remix, and Copyright Law</ref>\n\nThere are proposed theories of reform regarding the copyright law and remixes. Nicolas Suzor believes that copyright law should be reformed in such a manner as to allow certain reuses of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner where those derivatives are highly transformative and do not impact upon the primary market of the copyright owner. There certainly appears to be a strong argument that non commercial derivatives, which do not compete with the market for the original material, should be afforded some defense to copyright actions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nicolas Suzor|title=Transformative Use of Copyright Material|journal=LLM Thesis|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|year=2006|url=http://nic.suzor.com/publications}}</ref>\n\n[[Stanford Law]] professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] believes that for the first time in history creativity by default is subject to regulation because of two architectural features. First, cultural objects or products created digitally can be easily copied, and secondly, the default copyright law requires the permission of the owner. The result is that one needs the permission of the copyright owner to engage in mashups or acts of remixing. Lessig believes that the key to mashups and remix is \"education \u2013 not about framing or law \u2013 but rather what you can do with technology, and then the law will catch up\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4239/1/4239.pdf|title=Mashups, Remix, and Copyright Law}}</ref> \nHe believes that trade associations \u2013 like mashup guilds \u2013 that survey practices and publish reports to establish norm or reasonable behaviours in the context of the community would be useful in establishing fair use parameters. Lessig also \nbelieves that Creative Commons and other licences, such as the [[GNU General Public Licence]] are important mechanisms which mashup and remix artists can use to mitigate the impact of copyright law.<ref name=\"remixbook\">{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |title=Remix|year=2008|publisher=[[Penguin Press]]}}</ref> Lessig laid out his ideas in a book called [[Remix (book)|\"Remix\"]] which is itself free to remix under a [[CC BY-NC]] [[Creative commons license|license]].<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig\u2019s Remix, Then Remix It] on [[wired.com]]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054011/http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/remix.htm remix] on [[Bloomsbury Academic]] (2008, archived)</ref>\n\nThe [[Fair Use]] agreement allows users to use copyrighted materials without asking the permission of the original creator (section 107 of the federal copyright law). Within this agreement, the copyrighted material that is borrowed must be used under specific government regulations. Material borrowed falls under fair use depending on the amount of original content used, the nature of the content, the purpose of the borrowed content, and the effect the borrowed content has on an audience. Unfortunately, there are no distinct lines between copyright infringement and abiding by fair use regulations while producing a remix.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fair Use|url=http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html|work=U.S. Copyright Office|publisher=U.S. Copyright Office|accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref>  However, if the work that is distributed by the remixer is an entirely new and transformative work that is not for profit, copyright laws are not breached{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.  The key word in such considerations is transformative, as the remix product must have been either sufficiently altered or clearly used for a sufficiently different purpose for it to be safe from copyright violation.\n\nIn 2012, [[Canada]]'s [[Copyright Modernization Act]] explicitly added a new exemption which allows non-commercial remixing.<ref name=\"WIPO2015_4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda |last=Rostama |publisher=[[WIPO]]|quote=Canada is one of a few countries, if not the only one, to have introduced into its copyright law a new exception for non-commercial user-generated content. Article 29 of Canada's Copyright Modernization Act (2012) states that there is no infringement if: (i) the use is done solely for non-commercial purpose; (ii) the original source is mentioned; (iii) the individual has reasonable ground to believe that he or she is not infringing copyright; and (iv) the remix does not have a \"substantial adverse effect\" on the exploitation of the existing work.}}</ref>\nIn 2013, the US court ruling ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' acknowledged that amateur remixing might fall under fair use and copyright holders are requested to check and respect [[fair use]] before doing [[DMCA take down notice]]s.<ref name=\"WIPO2015_3\"/>\n\nIn June 2015, a [[WIPO]] article named ''\"Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma\"''<ref name=\"WIPO2015_3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda |last=Rostama |publisher=[[WIPO]]|quote=in 2013 a district court ruled that copyright owners do not have the right to simply take down content before undertaking a legal analysis to determine whether the remixed work could fall under fair use, a concept in US copyright law which permits limited use of copyrighted material without the need to obtain the right holder\u2019s permission (US District Court, Stephanie Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., Universal Music Publishing Inc., and Universal Music Publishing Group, Case No. 5:07-cv-03783-JF, January 24, 2013).[...] Given the emergence of today's \"remix\" culture, and the legal uncertainty surrounding remixes and mash-ups, the time would appear to be ripe for policy makers to take a new look at copyright law.}}</ref> acknowledged the \"age of remixing\" and the need for a [[Copyright reform movement|copyright reform]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Assemblage (composition)|Assemblage]]\n* [[Audio mixing]]\n* [[Ccmixter]]\n* [[Cover version]]\n* [[Multitrack recording|Multitracking]]\n* [[Musical montage]]\n* [[Plunderphonics]]\n* [[Sound collage]]\n* [[Web literacy|Web literacy (Remixing)]]\n* [[WhoSampled]]\n* [[Rave]]\n* [[Electronic dance music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|remix}}\n\n{{Appropriation in the Arts}}\n{{Music production}}\n\n[[Category:Remix| ]]\n[[Category:Musical techniques]]\n", "name_user": "Jessesndrs", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix"}

Nevertheless, until 1634 he used the title of Grand Duke of [[Muscovy]]. [[Free election (Poland)|Elected king of Poland]] in 1632, he was fairly successful in defending the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth against invasion, most notably in the [[Smolensk War]] of 1632\u201334, in which he participated personally. He supported [[religious tolerance]] and carried out military reforms, such as the founding of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy|Commonwealth Navy]]. He was also a renowned patron of the arts and music. He failed, however, to realize his dreams of regaining the Swedish crown, gaining fame by defeating the [[Ottoman Empire]], strengthening royal power, and reforming the Commonwealth.\n\nHe died without a legitimate male heir and was succeeded to the Polish throne by his half-brother, [[John II Casimir Vasa]] (''Jan Kazimierz Waza''). W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death marked the end of relative stability in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, as conflicts and tensions that had been growing over several decades came to a head with devastating consequences, notably the largest of the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings \u2013 the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648) \u2013 and the Swedish invasion (\"[[The Deluge (Polish history)|the Deluge]]\", 1655\u201360).\n\n==Royal titles==\n* In [[Latin]]: \"''Vladislaus Quartus Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogitiae, Livoniaeque, Smolenscie, Severiae, Czernichoviaeque necnon Suecorum, Gothorum Vandalorumque haereditarius rex, electus magnus dux Moschoviae.''\"\n* In English: \"W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV, by grace of God the King of [[Poland]], Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]], [[Ruthenia]], [[Prussia]], [[Masovia]], [[Samogitia]], [[Livonia]], and hereditary King of the [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], elected Grand Duke of [[Muscovy]].\"\n\nIn 1632 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sigismund Vasa\u2013Jagiellon was elected King of Poland.

However, before everything was confirmed and signed Ferdinand II died and Ferdinand III backed from giving the Silesian duchy to the son of W\u0142adys\u0142aw.

W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV was the son of [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (Polish: ''Zygmunt III Waza'') and his wife, [[Anna of Austria (1573\u20131598)|Anna of Austria]] (also known as Anna of Habsburg).\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw was elected [[Tsar of Russia]] by the [[Seven Boyars]] in 1610 when the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618)|Polish army captured Moscow]], but did not assume the throne due to his father's position and a popular uprising. Nevertheless, until 1634 he used the title of Grand Duke of [[Muscovy]]. [[Free election (Poland)|Elected king of Poland]] in 1632, he was fairly successful in defending the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth against invasion, most notably in the [[Smolensk War]] of 1632\u201334, in which he participated personally. He supported [[religious tolerance]] and carried out military reforms, such as the founding of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy|Commonwealth Navy]]. He was also a renowned patron of the arts and music. He failed, however, to realize his dreams of regaining the Swedish crown, gaining fame by defeating the [[Ottoman Empire]], strengthening royal power, and reforming the Commonwealth.\n\nHe died without a legitimate male heir and was succeeded to the Polish throne by his half-brother, [[John II Casimir Vasa]] (''Jan Kazimierz Waza''). W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death marked the end of relative stability in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, as conflicts and tensions that had been growing over several decades came to a head with devastating consequences, notably the largest of the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings \u2013 the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648) \u2013 and the Swedish invasion (\"[[The Deluge (Polish history)|the Deluge]]\", 1655\u201360).\n\n==Royal titles==\n* In [[Latin]]: \"''Vladislaus Quartus Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogitiae, Livoniaeque, Smolenscie, Severiae, Czernichoviaeque necnon Suecorum, Gothorum Vandalorumque haereditarius rex, electus magnus dux Moschoviae.''\"\n* In English: \"W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV, by grace of God the King of [[Poland]], Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]], [[Ruthenia]], [[Prussia]], [[Masovia]], [[Samogitia]], [[Livonia]], and hereditary King of the [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], elected Grand Duke of [[Muscovy]].\"\n\nIn 1632 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sigismund Vasa\u2013Jagiellon was elected King of Poland. He claimed to be [[King of Sweden]] by paternal inheritance, but was never able to gain possession of the throne.

This resulted in a long-standing feud, with the [[Polish kings]] of the [[House of Vasa]] claiming the Swedish throne.

democracy in the [[Classical Athens|Greek city-state of Athens]] developed around the fifth century BC, making Athens one of the first known democracies in the world, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica. It was a system of direct democracy, in which eligible citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills.\n*** [[Solon]] (c. 638 \u2013 c. 558 BC)&ndash; Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet. Legislated against political, economic, and moral decline in [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic Athens]].

He was elected [[strategos]] (one of ten such posts) in 445 BCE, which he held continuously until his death in 429 BCE, always by election of the Athenian Assembly. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is known as the \"[[Age of Pericles]]\".\n*** [[Ostracism]] &ndash; procedure under the Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years.\n*** [[Areopagus]] &ndash; council of elders of Athens, similar to the Roman Senate.

democracy in the [[Classical Athens|Greek city-state of Athens]] developed around the fifth century BC, making Athens one of the first known democracies in the world, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica. It was a system of direct democracy, in which eligible citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills.\n*** [[Solon]] (c. 638 \u2013 c. 558 BC)&ndash; Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet. Legislated against political, economic, and moral decline in [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic Athens]].

When Ephialtes was assassinated for overthrowing the elitist Council of the Aeropagus, his deputy Pericles stepped in. He was elected [[strategos]] (one of ten such posts) in 445 BCE, which he held continuously until his death in 429 BCE, always by election of the Athenian Assembly.

Cricinfo\n}}\n\nThe '''Sydney Cricket Ground''' ('''SCG''') is a sports [[stadium]] in [[Sydney]], Australia. It is used for [[Test cricket|Test]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20]] cricket, as well as [[Australian rules football]], [[rugby league]] football, [[rugby union]], and [[association football]]. It is the home ground for the [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales Blues]] [[cricket]] team, the [[Sydney Sixers]] of the [[Big Bash League]] and the [[Sydney Swans]] of the [[Australian Football League]]. It is also the temporary home of the [[Sydney Roosters]] of the National Rugby League and the [[NSW Waratahs]] of Super Rugby, during the redevelopment of the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. It is owned and operated by the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Trust]]. Until the 44,000 seat Sydney Football Stadium opened in 1988, the Sydney Cricket Ground was the major rugby league venue in Sydney.\n\n==History==\n=== Beginning ===\nIn 1811, the Governor of New South Wales, [[Lachlan Macquarie]], established the second Sydney Common, about one-and-a-half miles (about 2,400m) wide and extending south from South Head Road (now [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford St]]) to where [[Randwick Racecourse]] is today. Part sandhills, part swamp and situated on the south-eastern fringe of the city, it was used as a rubbish dump in the 1850s, and not regarded as an ideal place for sport. In 1851, part of the Sydney Common south of [[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]] was granted to the [[British Army]] for use as a garden and [[cricket]] ground for the soldiers. Its first user was the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th North Devonshire Regiment]] which flattened and graded the southern part of the rifle range adjacent to the Barracks.\n\nIn the next couple of years, the teams from Victoria Barracks combined themselves into a more permanent organisation and called themselves the Garrison Club. The ground therefore became known as the Garrison Ground when it was first opened in February 1854.\n\nUp until that time [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] had been the main sporting and racing ground in the colony but when it was dedicated as public gardens in 1856 city cricketers and footballers had to find somewhere else to play.\n\nIn the late 1860s another part of the Sydney Common, the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street, was opened for public recreation. It was named [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] after the [[Mayor of Sydney]], Charles Moore, who planted a number of [[Moreton Bay Fig]] trees which exist to this day. As well as the location of Sydney's first [[zoo]], Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs [[Sydney University]] and the Wallaroos. Sydney at the time was a small, dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts. It was not liked so much by cricketers because it was too far from the city.\n\n[[File:England v. Australia Cricket Match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, January 27 1883 - by unknown photographer (3064799664).jpg|thumb|left|England v Australia at SCG, 27 January 1883]]\nWhen the commander of the Sydney garrison, Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson, aligned his soldiers to the East Sydney Cricket Club, the Garrison Ground became known as the Civil and Military Ground. In 1870 British troops left Victoria barracks and the future of the Civil and Military Ground became uncertain. However, with the closure of the [[Albert ground sydney|Albert Ground]] in the 1870s, the [[New South Wales Cricket Association|NSW Cricket Association]] (NSWCA) began regular use of the Civil and Military Ground.\n\nIn 1875, the NSW Government began to upgrade the ground. Despite efforts by Victoria Barracks and then the Carlingford, Redfern, Fitzroy and Albert cricket clubs to take control, the then president of the NSWCA, [[Richard Driver]] (after whom Driver Avenue outside the ground is named), persuaded the government to let the NSWCA look after the ground's administration. In 1876, the ground was dedicated by Governor Sir [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Hercules Robinson]].\n\n[[File:Charles Bayliss.jpg|thumb|left|The Cricket Ground in 1892]]\nThe NSWCA had influential supporters. Driver himself was a prominent MP and solicitor for the [[City of Sydney|City of Sydney Council]]. The Minister for Lands, Thomas Garrett, was also supportive; his son was about to break into the colonial side. It is hardly surprising therefore that within a couple of years of the NSWCA taking control of the ground, the governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, appointed Driver himself, William W. Stephen and Phillip Sheridan (after whom a grandstand was named), the first trustees. Two trustees were appointed by the government and one by the NSWCA. The close relationship between the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Trust|Trust]] and the NSWCA is evidenced by the fact that they pooled funds for the next six years. The military's link with the ground was finally severed when John Richardson and the Sydney garrison went to fight in the [[Mahdist War|Sudan]]. The trustees then took the opportunity to rename the ground the Association Ground\n\nIn 1883 the most prominent trustee, Sheridan, regarding the ground as the responsibility of the trustees, began to act independently of the NSWCA, resulting in the NSWCA losing control of the ground. Over the next century there was constant conflict between the Trust and the NSWCA over whether other sports such as [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[tennis]] and [[cycling]], the organisers of which were all keen to use the venue, had access to it. One conflict in 1904, over the Trust's plan to hold a cycling event which clashed with a cricket match, ended up in court. The NSWCA's influence was eventually reduced even further over the years due to changes in the way the State Government appointed trustees.\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Scg scoreboard 1900.jpg|thumb|right|The SCG scoreboard in January 1901]]\nBy the time of the [[Cricket in Australia|first Sydney cricket test]] in February 1882, the ground could boast two grandstands; the Brewongle Stand at the southern end and the original Members' Stand, which had been built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members' Stand now sits. On opposite sides of the ground to the stands two spectator mounds were built. They became known as The Hill and the Paddington Hill.\n\nIn 1886, the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Members' Stand and Lady Members' Stand|Members' Pavilion]] was rebuilt at a cost of \u00a36,625. Membership was levied at two guineas.\n\nIn 1881 a loop in the tram line, which ran down Randwick Road (now [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]]), was built to service the Ground and the Pastoral and Agricultural Society Ground (later the RAS Showgrounds and now Fox Studios) next door.\n\nIn 1894 the ground finally received its modern name, the Sydney Cricket Ground, which was followed by the opening of the [[Hill Stand]], situated between The Hill and the Paddington Hill. It became known as the Bob Stand during the Depression years because it cost one shilling (a bob) to enter.\n\nThe first SCG [[scoreboard]] was built in the two weeks leading up to the 1895\u20131896 inter-colonial match between New South Wales and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Although it was Sheridan's idea, the design was Ned Gregory's who believed that English scoreboards were inadequate. Requiring two men to operate it, the new scoreboard was hailed as one of the wonders of the cricket world. Boards with players' names on them were placed in different slits alongside scrolls of canvas with numbers painted on them which were rolled up and down to show the changing score. Under the scoreboard was a refreshment stall which sold, among other things, [[oysters]].\n\n[[File:Cricket at the Sydney Cricket Ground, 12 December 1903.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Sydney Cricket Ground on 12 December 1903]]\nIn 1896 the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Members' Stand and Lady Members' Stand|Ladies' Stand]] was opened, along with a concrete cycling track which circled the inside of the ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article169754541 |title=AMATEUR CYCLING CARNIVAL. |newspaper=[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth (Sydney, NSW : 1894\u20131954)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=13 December 1896 |accessdate=2 June 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> One of the carpenters who built the formwork for the track was George Bradman, father of [[Don Bradman]]. In 1898 floodlights were built over the cycling track so that night events could be held. In 1904 the scoreboard was rebuilt at the top of The Hill and in 1909 the Sheridan Stand, named after Phil Sheridan, was opened at the southern end, replacing the earlier Smokers' Stand.\n\nIn the period up to World War I the SCG was used for a wide variety of sports including [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[tennis]], [[baseball]], football and cycling. The cycling track however was removed in 1920. In 1924 Ned Gregory's scoreboard was closed and the concrete scoreboard at the back of the Hill opened.\n\n[[File:Sydney Cricket Ground 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|A crowded SCG during a 1930s cricket match]]\nDuring the 1920s, and 1930s crowds packed into the SCG to see Don Bradman play for New South Wales and Australia. Many of the huge gate takings that Bradman brought in for the NSWCA were spent on developing the ground. A large new stand was built at the northern end in two stages. It replaced the Northern Stand and was intended to also replace the Members' and Ladies' Stands.  The first stage, begun while Bradman was still playing for New South Wales, was opened in 1936 at a cost of \u00a390,000 and named the 'M.A. Noble Stand' after the great Australian captain [[Monty Noble]]. The second stage, completed in 1973 at a cost of $2 million, was named the Bradman Stand after the great man himself.\n\nFurther redevelopment of the ground began in 1978 with the advent of [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) and games played at night. When media giant [[Kerry Packer]] failed to obtain the television broadcast rights for cricket, he bought the top 30\u201340 players in the world and staged his own competition, World Series Cricket.\n\nPacker applied to use the SCG for WSC in 1977 but the SCG Trust, which administered the ground, refused. However the NSW Labor Government, under Premier [[Neville Wran]], amended the ''Sydney Sports Ground and Cricket Ground Act'' to remove the Trust's power to decide who played at the SCG and the NSWCA's traditional right over the ground. A new Trust was established with 12 members appointed by the Government and two elected by SCG members. The new Trust had no WSC opponents, and although legal action by the NSWCA stopped WSC games being played at the SCG in 1977, they were played there in 1978.\n\n[[File:Scg scoreboard 1950.jpg|thumb|left|The SCG scoreboard in 1950]] \nIn the years since WSC the character of the SCG has somewhat changed. Six light towers were built in 1978 at a cost of $1.2 million so that cricket could be played at night, and two huge new stands were constructed at the southern end of the ground. The new Brewongle Stand was built on the site of the old Brewongle Stand at a cost $8.9 million and opened in 1980. The Churchill Stand, named after rugby league legend [[Clive Churchill]], replaced the Sheridan Stand at a cost of $8.2 million and was opened in 1986.\n\nThe old concrete scoreboard was closed in 1983 and a new electronic board erected above The Hill. This board allowed the crowd to see video replays and provided more scope for advertising. The old concrete scoreboard sat behind the Doug Walters Stand unused until 2006 when it was dismantled and stored offsite to make way for the Victor Trumper Stand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-13/old-scg-cricket-scoreboard-where-is-it-curious-sydney/9371316|title=Iconic SCG cricket scoreboard returns to Sydney home|date=2018-09-13|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\nThe Bob Stand has been moved to [[North Sydney Oval]], replaced by the [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] Stand. This stand was originally named the Pat Hills Stand, after the [[Pat Hills|NSW Labor Government Minister and SCG Trust member]], when it was opened in 1984. However, the incoming [[Nick Greiner|Greiner Government]] changed the name to the O'Reilly Stand after the legendary spin bowler.\n\nThe Hill also has gone but the reason for that is a little harder to pin. Up until 1991 the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and attracting [[working class]] patronage. The invention of the [[Beverage can|beer can]] and the portable [[cooler]] in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of [[limited overs cricket|limited overs]] games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill in 1991<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=276|title=Over the hill: an era ends at the SCG {{!}} Austadiums|website=austadiums.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.\n\n[[File:Moore Park Sydney Cricket Ground 1.JPG|thumb|Sydney Cricket Ground members entrance, 2007]]\nFurther developments have taken place in more recent years with the internal reconstruction of the M.A. Noble stand completed in 1994 and the opening of the NSW Cricket Centre in 1997. This facility includes indoor training wickets and administrative offices for Cricket NSW (formerly NSW Cricket Association). In 1999 the original electronic scoreboard was replaced by a new higher-definition video screen. In the 21st Century the Hill has been completely redeveloped with a new 12,000 seat [[Victor Trumper]] Stand, completed in 2008. This stand brings the SCG's capacity to 46,000 spectators. During the re-development, the 2 original light towers on the hill were replaced and the 4 other light towers were upgraded,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=328|title=It's all looking bright for the SCG {{!}} Austadiums|website=austadiums.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> a new video screen was also installed in the Clive Churchill stand, replacing the screen that was on the hill.\n\nThe SCG Trust rebuilt the MA Noble, Don Bradman and Dally Messenger stands for the [[2013\u201314 Ashes series]], it increased ground capacity to 48,000 spectators. This redevelopment was mostly completed in March 2014 at a cost of $197.5 million and also included a large new video screen.\n\nIn September 2018, construction began on a new video screen to replace the video screen at the Messenger Stand with the LED panels for the screen transferred across from the Sydney Football Stadium with an upgrade to the video screen in the Clive Churchill Stand and new LED advertising banners being installed in all of the stands except for the Members and Ladies pavilions. The work was completed in time for [[Sydney FC]]'s first ever A-League game at the SCG.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=621|title=New SCG scoreboard debuts as soccer returns|work=Austadiums|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, the Trust are keen on redeveloping the Bill O'Reilly stand, and later the Churchill and Brewongle stands, further increasing the grounds capacity. The ground will be a near complete modern \"bowl\" stadium with the exception of the two heritage listed Members and Ladies pavilions.\n\n==Stands==\nIn its present configuration, the SCG is a playing field surrounded by a collection of separate grandstand structures. From the northern end, clockwise, they are:\n*[[Monty Noble|M.A Noble]], [[Don Bradman|Bradman]] and [[Dally Messenger|Messenger]] stands \u2013 Constructed in 2013/2014. The stand contains corporate boxes, media facilities and members seating for Trust members and in the winter for eligible Swans members. The Messenger Stand is also home to the main video screen for the ground. \n*[[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] Stand (previously named [[Pat Hills]] Stand) \u2013 Built 1984 \u2013 Corporate boxes and public reserved seating.\n*[[Victor Trumper]] Stand \u2013 Constructed in 2007/2008, replaced Yabba's Hill and Doug Walters Stand, corporate boxes and public reserved seating.\n*[[Clive Churchill]] Stand \u2013 Built 1986 \u2013 Corporate boxes and public reserved seating.

The SCG Trust operates the Sydney Cricket Ground and [[Sydney Football Stadium]] at [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] in eastern Sydney. In mid-2008, its head office The Sheridan Building is opened, making it the third building to erect in the Gold Members Car Park, alongside the Headquarters of Sydney Roosters and New South Wales Rugby Union. Soon after it opened Sydney FC relocated their Headquarters inside the Sheridan Building. The Sydney Swans headquarters are located in the SCG accessible from Driver Avenue.

Although games were played at the [[The Domain, Sydney|Domain]], the Garrison Ground was used for practice by the NSW cricket team in 1860 and by the Victorian team in 1861 the before inter-colonial matches in those years.\n\nCricket was first played in Australia in Sydney's Hyde Park in 1803. However, up until the appointment of trustees to look after the SCG in the late 1870s, several different grounds had been used. The Domain was first used for inter-colonial games and then the Albert Ground in Redfern but in time both became unavailable, the Domain because of its poor condition and because it could not be fenced in and the Albert Ground because it closed in the late 1870s.\n\nAfter the closure of the Albert Ground the New South Wales Cricket Association began using the Association Ground. The first game played there was the final of the Civil Service Challenge Cup on 25 October 1877, between the New South Wales Government Printing Office and the Audit Office. The first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match was the inter-colonial game between New South Wales and Victoria played on 22, 23 and 25 February 1878 where New South Wales won by 1 wicket.<ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales vs. Victoria, 1877\u201378|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1870S/1877-78/AUS_LOCAL/NSW_VIC_22-25FEB1878.html|website=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n{{main|Sydney Riot of 1879}}\nDuring the 1878\u201379 season [[Lord Harris]]' England team toured Australia. The feature of the tourists game against New South Wales at the SCG in 1879 was a riot sparked apparently when the crowd disagreed with an umpiring decision by [[George Coulthard]] that went against the locals. Lord Harris believed the invasion of the ground by about 2000 spectators was actually started by bookmakers in the stand. One of the umpires for the match was [[Edmund Barton]], later to become Australia's first Prime Minister.\n\nBy the time the first test was played at the SCG between 17 February and 21 February 1882 the ground was in fine condition. The NSWCA had appointed Ned Gregory as curator and given him a cottage next to the ground for him and his family. Australia won that game by overhauling England's scores of 133 and 232 with scores of 197 and 5 for 169.\n\nThe ground high score in Test cricket was held for more than a century by Englishman [[R. E. Foster|Reg \"Tip\" Foster]], who scored 287 in an Australia-England match in 1903. In the 100th test to be played at the SCG in January 2012, [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was joined first by [[Ricky Ponting]] in a partnership of 288 and then by [[Michael Hussey]] in a partnership of 334 and built a score of 329 not out against India.<ref>{{cite news|last = Jackson|first = Glenn|date = 5 January 2012|title = Advantage Australia as Clarke's triple ton puts hosts in box seat|url = http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/advantage-australia-as-clarkes-triple-ton-puts-hosts-in-box-seat-20120105-1pm0m.html|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate = 5 January 2012|publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Don Bradman]] made his first visit to the ground in the 1920\u201321 season to watch the Fifth Test of the Australia and England series. In that game [[Charlie Macartney]] scored 170 to help seal a win for Australia.\n\nBradman scored the highest ever first-class innings of 452 at the SCG for New South Wales against Queensland in 1928\u201329. This record was surpassed by [[Hanif Mohammad]] who scored 499 run out. It was further bettered by the West Indian [[Brian Lara]] who scored 501 in 1994.\n\nThe 1928\u201329 season was a big one for cricket. On 15 December, the largest ever crowd to attend a cricket match at the SCG, 58,446, saw Australia and England play. With changes to the ground seating the record is unlikely to be beaten.\n\n[[File:Sydney Cricket Ground, Warne final balls, 2007.jpg|thumb|Shane Warne is pictured bowling one of his last balls in Test cricket]]\n[[File:Pm cricket shots09 6040.jpg|thumb|left|South Africa playing against Australia in 2009]]\nIn the last test of the 1970\u201371 English tour, England fast bowler [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] struck Australian spinner and tailender [[Terry Jenner]] on the head with a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]. The Sydney crowd let Snow and the English know they were not happy with his behaviour and when Snow took up his fielding position on the fence a spectator spoke to him and grabbed him by the shirt. Cans were thrown onto the field and England captain [[Ray Illingworth]] took his team from the ground.\n\nThe first women's club cricket match was held at the SCG in 1886 when the Fernleas played the Siroccos. Although cricket was not seen as an appropriate game for women, women's cricket associations were formed in Victoria in 1905 and other states in the 1920s, and 1930s.\n\nNight cricket was first played at the SCG on 28 November 1978 with World Series Cricket. A crowd of 50,000 packed the ground.\n\nThe SCG was the scene of [[Shane Warne]]'s first (1992) and final tests (2007). In 2007, [[Justin Langer]] and [[Glenn McGrath]] also played their final tests.\n\n[[File:Australia won the Ashes 5-0.jpg|thumb|Celebrations at the SCG after Australia won the Ashes 5-0 in 2014]]\n\nDuring the 100th Test match held at SCG, on 3 January 2012, [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] scored his maiden triple century against India and was the first player to do so at the ground.

[[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] and [[Don Bradman]] scored four in a row in [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. During the streak, he scored a century within the first session of the game in 2017 against Pakistan. He also scored a half century in the second innings. The half century streak continued to three when he scored a half century in the first innings of the final test in the [[2017\u201318 Ashes series|2017-18 Ashes series]], but the century streak ended as Australia won by an innings, and was not required to bat again.\n\nOn 12 January 2019, Australia won the first ODI [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2018\u201319|against India]] at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 34 runs, to record their 1,000th win in international cricket.<ref name=\"Aus1k\">{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/971683 |title=Jhye Richardson sets up Australia's 1000th win |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Rugby league==\n{{see also|List of rugby league test matches at the Sydney Cricket Ground}}\nThe SCG has hosted 1,392 top-level premiership rugby league games \u2013 more than any other ground (as of 2015), in addition to 70 [[List of Rugby League Test Matches at the Sydney Cricket Ground|Test matches]] and [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] games. Between 1913 and 1987, the [[NSWRFL Premiership]] Final was always played at the SCG, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. Due to the ground's historical significance to rugby league, it is often used for special heritage matches for [[National Rugby League]] club and representative matches. \n \n[[Rugby league]] was first played at the SCG on 22 June 1911 between [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15230859 |title=The Rugby League: Cricket Ground Secured |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 May 1911 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The ground was first used by the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] in 1913. At this time the Trust only gave players access to dressing sheds in the Sheridan Stand and did not allow use of the rooms in the Member's Stand. This rule was relaxed in 1918. The [[1915 NSWRFL season]]'s first round match between defending premiers [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] and [[Glebe (rugby league team)|Glebe]] was played in front of a record crowd of 13,000.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haddan|first1=Stephen|title=History of the NSW Rugby League Finals|date=1991|location=Australia|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8yLwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2014|isbn=9780646050980}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1920 Great Britain Lions tour]] saw the British rugby league team tour Australia for the first time since World War I and huge crowds attended their games. The first match of the tour was at the SCG against [[City New South Wales rugby league team|Metropolis]] in front of nearly 68,000 spectators. Australia won the first Test in [[Brisbane]] and in the second Test at the SCG on 3 July. The Australians sealed the series, scoring five tries to win 21\u20138 and secure the [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes series]] for the first time at home.\n\nThe attendance record for a rugby league match in Australia was broken in 1932 when 70,204 people saw Australia play England in the first test of the [[1932 Rugby League Ashes series|1932 Ashes series]] at the Cricket Ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21967053 |title=World's Record Crowd. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |location=Qld. |date=7 June 1932 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> It was also in this game that the Australians first wore the green jersey with a double gold 'V', which they have been wearing ever since. The English side boasted one of the great rugby league back lines consisting of captain [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] (fullback), [[Alf Ellaby]] and [[Stanley Smith (rugby league born c. 1910)|Stan Smith]] (wings), and [[Artie Atkinson]] and [[Stan Brogden]] in the centres. The gates of the SCG had to be closed to prevent another 15,000 people from entering. Australia lost the game 8\u20136. The second game was the famous \"[[1932 Great Britain Lions tour#Battle of Brisbane 1932|Battle of Brisbane]]\" Test, which Australia won. In the third Test back at the SCG Australia lead 11\u20133 until late in the game. Incredibly, England scored three quick tries to snatch the game (18\u201313) and the series. The attendance of the first test stood as the highest recorded crowd for an international rugby league match until 73,631 fans attended the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup final|1992 World Cup Final]] between Australia and [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at the famous [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London, England.\n\n[[File:SCG rugby league match 1950.JPG|thumb|left|Unrecognizable after playing on a muddy SCG, footballers of the [[Great Britain Lions|British]] and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] national rugby league sides leave the field after the first Test on 12 June 1950.]]The next tour by England was in 1946, knows as The \"Indomitables\" tour due to the Great Britain team traveling to Australia on the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Indomitable (92)|HMS Indomitable]]. The first test played on 17 June was an 8 \u2013 8 draw, the opening try of the series was scored by the legendary [[Frank Whitcombe]] for the tourists, in front of a crowd of 64,527. England went on to win The Ashes. In 1950 Australia had not won a series against the team Lions for 30 years but this time there was a big change. Britain had won the first Test and Australia the second, which made the third SCG Test the decider. The tour coincided with a record amount of rain and by the time the teams arrived the SCG was a mud heap. Forty tonnes of soil were brought in and spread over the surface to try and dry it out. Tied 2\u20132 at half time, Australia scored the only try of the match late in the second half when winger [[Ron Roberts (rugby league)|Ron Roberts]] crossed in the corner to seal the win. At the end of the game the crowd of over 47,000 jumped the fence and invaded the field and congregated in front of the Members Stand cheering and calling for Aussie captain [[Clive Churchill]].\n\nThe [[1963 NSWRFL Grand Final]] was won by the [[St. George Dragons]] 8\u20133 in front of 69,860 fans in atrocious conditions. It was the Dragons eighth consecutive premiership and their third consecutive grand final win against the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]. The match's only try, scored by Dragons winger [[Johnny King]], was clouded in controversy after he appeared to be tackled when a defender knocked him flat on the ground, only to get up and carry the ball to the try line under howls of protest from Wests players who believe that the referee had called King to play the ball. That try became the centre of furore when rumors spread that match referee Darcy Lawler had bet on St. George to win (Wests captain [[Arthur Summons]] later claimed one of his players announced to his teammates before the game that any who had bet on the Magpies to win had better lay off their bets as referee Lawler had backed St. George). After the match, photographer John O'Gready took the iconic rugby league photograph, \"The Gladiators\", depicting Arthur Summons supporting St. George captain [[Norm Provan]]. The photo of Summons and Provan was later used as the basis for the [[Winfield Cup]] trophy, and continues to be used to this day with the [[National Rugby League]]'s [[Telstra]] Premiership Trophy.\n\nOn 18 September 1965, the largest ever official crowd at the SCG, 78,056, saw St George defeat the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] 12\u20138 in the [[1965 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|NSWRFL grand final]]. Gates were ordered to be closed two hours before the game began and children were allowed to sit inside the fence. Contemporary accounts indicate that many more \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 gained other means of access and sat on grandstand roofs or went into the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)]] and viewed the match from the stairways and roof of the main pavilion. Estimates from people there that day put the crowd as high as 90,000. This would stand as the largest rugby league crowd in Australia until Game 2 of the [[1994 State of Origin series]] when 87,161 attended the game at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Due to the overcrowding of the ground during the grand final, the [[New South Wales Police Force]] imposed a 70,000 capacity limit on the Cricket Ground for safety reasons.\n\nThe SCG hosted the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup Final]], won 20\u20132 by the [[Johnny Raper]] led Australians over [[France national rugby league team|France]] in front of 54,290. The Australian team that day, coached by [[Harry Bath]], boasted legends of the Australian game in Raper (Lock), [[Eric Simms (rugby league)|Eric Simms]] (Fullback), [[Graeme Langlands]] and [[Johnny Greaves (rugby league)|Johnny Greaves]] (centres), [[Bob Fulton]] (Five-eighth), [[Billy Smith (rugby league)|Billy Smith]] (halfback), [[Arthur Beetson]] (prop) and [[Dick Thornett]] and [[Ron Coote]] (second-row). Although the Final attracted over 54,000 fans, this was actually not the highest attendance of the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968 World Cup]]. That came during the opening game of the tournament when 62,256 saw Australia defeat Great Britain 25-10. This would stand as the highest attendance for a World Cup match until 73,631 attended the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|1992 World Cup Final]] to see Australia again defeat Great Britain 10-6 at the famous [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]].\n\nOne of the most courageous efforts at the SCG was [[John Sattler]]'s performance in the [[NSWRFL season 1970#Grand Final|1970 grand final]] between South Sydney and the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate [[Michael Cleary (rugby)|Michael Cleary]], asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates not to take the field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23\u201312 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.\n\nThe Cricket Ground hosted what many consider to be the toughest grand final of all in [[1973 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1973]] when defending premiers Manly-Warringah faced the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], who were playing in their first ever grand final after joining the competition in [[1967 NSWRFL season|1967]]. The Sharks were Captain-coached by Great Britain halfback [[Tommy Bishop]] and had a forward pack led by his tough [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] and GB teammate [[Cliff Watson]] and [[Rothmans Medal|1973 Rothmans Medallist]] [[Ken Maddison]], along with goal kicking 18-year-old whiz-kid centre [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]]. Manly were coached by [[Ron Willey]] and captained by tough hooker [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Freddy Jones]], and could boast internationals [[Ken Irvine]], [[Ray Branighan]], Bob Fulton, [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]], British lock [[Mal Reilly|Malcolm Reilly]], as well as tough tackling second-row forward [[Terry Randall]] and 19-year-old fullback [[Graham Eadie]]. From the opening kick off the game descended into a series of high or late tackles and several all-in brawls, though surprisingly referee Keith Page didn't send any player off, despite threatening to do so and repeatedly handing out cautions, including twice to all 26 players on the field. In the opening minutes of the game, Mal Reilly was felled in back play by Cronulla hooker [[Ron Turner (rugby league)|Ron \"Rocky\" Turner]] well after he kicked the ball and, after writhing on the ground in agony with a badly bruised hip, left the field for a pain killing injection. When he returned he created mayhem with strong-arm tactics, although he was clearly out of sorts football wise and was replaced after just 25 minutes by John Bucknell. In the end, the difference between the two teams was Manly's international centre Bob Fulton who scored two tries in leading Manly to a 10\u20137 win. The game was described by [[Sunday Telegraph]] writer Ian Heads as ''\"A grand final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl\"''.<ref>Sydney Sunday Telegraph, 16 September 1973</ref>\n\nIn 1975, in one of the most memorable [[1975 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|grand finals]] ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] coached [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters]], defeated St. George 38\u20130 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the [[2008 NRL Grand Final]] played between Manly Warringah and the [[Melbourne Storm]], Manly winning by the tune of 40\u20130. However, the game was famous for reasons other than the scoreline. St George's Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback [[Russell Fairfax]] and centre [[Mark Harris (rugby league)|Mark Harris]], and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void \u2013 [[John Rheinberger]] \u2013 who played in his first only first grade game in the grand final. Leading by only 5\u20130 at half-time, the Roosters scored an avalanche of tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club \u2013 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters' eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.\n\nThe SCG hosted its second Rugby League World Cup Final in [[1977 Rugby League World Cup Final|1977]]. On 25 June Australia defeated Great Britain 13-12 in front of just 24,457 fans. The match was highlighted by a 60-metre try to Manly-Warringah centre [[Russel Gartner]] who outpaced the Lions chasers late in the first half to give Australia an 8-5 lead. This would prove to be (as of 2016) the last World Cup game played at the SCG.\n\nIn [[1981 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1981]], another memorable and emotional rugby league grand final was played at the SCG. Since joining the Sydney Premiership in [[1947 NSWRFL season|1947]], the [[Parramatta Eels]] had not won a grand final. In [[1976 NSWRFL season|1976]] and [[1977 NSWRFL season|1977]] it had suffered consecutive losses, first to Manly-Warringah (who also joined the league in 1947) and then St George in the first replayed grand final. In 1981, the Eels 'dream team' (another team coached by Jack Gibson), comprising internationals [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]], [[Ron Hilditch]] and [[Bob O'Reilly|Bob \"The Bear\" O'Reilly]], as well as budding stars [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Steve Ella]], [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[John Muggleton]], outscored the [[Tommy Raudonikis]] captained [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]] four tries to three to win 20\u201311 and secure their first premiership. Playing second-row for Newtown that day was future dual grand final winning, and [[New South Wales rugby league team|NSW]] State of Origin coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]]. Financial pressures at the Newtown club would result in the Jets competing in the New South Wales Rugby League first grade competition for only two seasons following their 1981 grand final appearance.\n\nThe [[1986 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1986 NSWRL Grand Final]] at the SCG between the [[John Monie]] coached Parramatta and defending premiers [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]], coached by [[Warren Ryan]], and played in front of one of the smallest grand final crowds in years (45,843), would go down as the lowest scoring and only try-less grand final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4\u20132 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), at the time the record number of points scored in a career.\n\nThe last ever rugby league grand final played at the Cricket Ground was the [[1987 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1987 decider]] between the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the [[Canberra Raiders]], who had joined the premiership in [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]]. In front of 50,201 fans on an unseasonably warm day in Sydney, the Sea Eagles ran out 18\u20138 winners, scoring two tries to one with dual rugby international [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] scoring 14 of Manly's points with a try and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Manly's other try scorer that day, Five-eighth [[Cliff Lyons]] won the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] as the man of the match.\n\nThe ground lost the grand final and numerous games to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (SFS) in [[1988 NSWRL season|1988]]. Even so, between 1988 and 2018 the ground continued to host occasional [[National Rugby League]] matches,<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Matthew|date=22 May 2009|url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=33331|title=SCG Magic offers the NRL one big positive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210064606/http://rleague.com/db/article.php?id=33331|archivedate=10 February 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-25/tigers-again-to-call-scg-home/2351096 Tigers again to call SCG home] (25 November 2010)</ref> mostly featuring the Heritage round game between [[St George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]] and [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and the [[2008 Centenary Rugby League Test|2008 Centenary]] [[ANZAC Test]] between Australia and New Zealand, in what was the first test held at the famous old ground since the [[Wally Lewis]] captained Australians had defeated the Kiwis 29\u201312 on [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series|19 July 1986]] in front of 34,302 fans.

All colonies of Australia were well established when the final versions of the rules of the game were codified by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1875 and by the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] in 1877 when it held its first tournament at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].\n\nTennis was regularly played at the SCG in the early days. The Sydney tournament which was to become the [[New South Wales Open]], was first played at the SCG in 1885 before moving to the NSW Lawn Tennis Club's courts at Double Bay, then to [[White City Stadium (Sydney)|White City]] and later to the [[NSW Tennis Centre|Olympic Tennis Centre]] at [[Homebush Bay]]. The SCG was the host of the [[1908 Australasian Championships]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10192715 |title=Lawn Tennis. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=19,468 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=10 December 1908 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Motor racing==\nIn 1898, Sydney cycle firm, Gavin Gibson Ltd, imported seven motorised tricycles produced by Count [[Jules-Albert de Dion]] and powered by one cylinder petrol engines designed by his partner [[Georges Bouton]]. On the evening of 1 January 1901, these seven machines raced around the concrete cycle track which ringed the inside of the SCG in those days to compete in Australia's first ever motor race.\n\n==Empire Games==\nThe SCG was the main stadium for the [[1938 British Empire Games]] which were tied into the State's sesqui-centenary celebrations. Perhaps because of this the Federal Government provided no money and only \u00a310,000 came from the State Government to cover the organising committee's administrative costs. The budget was therefore, very tight and using the existing SCG was one way of making ends meet. Cyclist Edgar \"Dunc\" Gray led the teams onto the ground and athletes ran on a makeshift grass track.\n\n==Rugby union==\nClub rugby was first played at the then Civil and Military Ground as early as 1870, and the first inter-colonial game was played there in 1882. NSW beat [[Queensland]] 28\u20134. From June 1911 the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSW Rugby League]] had exclusive use of the SCG, as well as the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] and the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]], preventing rugby union games from being played there. Over the years the SCG hosted 71 rugby union tests before Sydney international matches were moved first to Waratah Rugby Park ([[Concord Oval]]), then the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] and later [[Stadium Australia]]. The largest ever crowd to watch a rugby union match at the SCG was 49,327 who saw NSW played [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] on 13 July 1907.\n\nOf those 71 tests none could have been more dramatic than the game against the South African [[Springboks]] on 7 August 1971. Marred by anti-[[apartheid]] protests, field invasions and objects being thrown onto the ground and halted several times to remove golf balls and protestors, it was won by South Africa who went through the tour undefeated.\n\nThe SCG has been both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst incidents to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped on the bottom of a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.\n\nDramatic though that game was, no test could have been as important in the development of [[Australian Rugby Union]] than the game against the touring [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh]] team in 1978.\n\nThe 1978 Welsh had arrived in Australia as (the then) [[Rugby Union Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] Champions, [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]] winners, the best rugby union team in the world but they were a sad and sorry bunch by the time they got to Sydney for the last game of the tour, the second test. The team was decimated by injuries and in two earlier tour games had suffered a last minute loss to Sydney and a humiliating defeat midweek to the [[ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union|Australian Capital Territory]].\n\nRumours abounded that the Welsh were ready for a big 'get square' with Australian prop Steve Finnane, the so-called 'enforcer' of the Australian team. Finnane and other senior members of the team had vowed to avenge the defeat of the Australians by the Welsh on their last tour of the UK several years before. The SCG crowd didn't have long to wait because after the very first scrum Welsh prop [[Graham Price]] came out holding his bloodied jaw, the victim of a Finnane punch. Price had bored in on Finnane, his opposite number in the front row and Finnane reacted.\n\nAfter Price left the field and the game continued for a short while until the Welsh, using a pre-determined code word, sparked an all-in-brawl. Wales lost the test and the two-test series.\n\nIn 1979 there was a one-off game against the [[All Blacks]] at the SCG. The kicking of a young five-eighth named Tony Melrose closed out the New Zealanders and Australia won a try-less game 12\u20136, to take back the [[Bledisloe Cup]] for the first time since 1949. The following year the Australians showed it was no fluke by beating New Zealand two tests to one in Australia to successfully defend the trophy for the first time.\n\nOn 14 April 2018 the [[NSW Waratahs]] played a home game at the SCG against the [[Queensland Reds]] in the Waratahs first appearance at the ground in 35 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com.au/rugby/story/_/id/23109528/waratahs-not-inspired-scg-rich-rugby-history-growden|title=Waratahs can't not be inspired by SCG history|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://austadiums.com/sport/event.php?eventid=20704|title=Super Rugby: Waratahs v Reds {{!}} Austadiums|website=austadiums.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2019 Super Rugby season]] the Waratahs will stage 3 of their home games at the SCG while the Sydney Football Stadium is rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scgt.nsw.gov.au/sydney-cricket-ground/whats-on/news/waratahs-to-play-three-blockbuster-games-at-scg/|title=Waratahs to play three blockbuster games at SCG|website=www.scgt.nsw.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Australian rules football==\n[[File:05129r.jpg|thumb|right|A New South Wales player marks over a West Australian opponent in the goal square at the 1933 [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|Australian Football Carnival]]. The old [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] is in the background]]\nThe first [[Australian rules football]] match to be played at the SCG was [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|Inter-Colonial]] football match played between Victoria and New South Wales on 6 August 1881.\n\n[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] played a premiership match at Moore Park in 1904 in front of the Governor General and Governor of NSW. Melbourne won and both teams had to return home by boat down the coast; two other matches (Fitzroy v Collingwood and Geelong v Carlton, which had been postponed) were also played there in 1903. In 1922, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] played a combined New South Wales side on the ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article106674362 |title=FOOTBALL |newspaper=[[The Herald (Adelaide)|Daily Herald]] |volume=XIII |issue=3879 |location=South Australia |date=24 August 1922 |accessdate=22 July 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the ground was rarely used for Australian Rules, except for the occasional exhibition match or interstate football carnival.\n\nRichmond played Collingwood there in 1952, and eight VFL matches were played there in 1979\u20131981, but Australian rules football was not to make a regular comeback to the SCG until 1982, when [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] relocated to Sydney and made the SCG its home ground.\n\n===Sydney Swans===\n{{Main|Sydney Swans}}\n\n[[File:Marking contest between the Sydney Swans and Western Bulldogs @ SCG.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sydney Swans]] playing the [[Western Bulldogs]] at the SCG in 2008]]\nSouth Melbourne was formed in 1867, a foundation member of the first Australian rules competition the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) and also its later replacement the [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL). The club won five premierships with the VFA up to 1890 and three more in the VFL in the first half of the 20th Century, but a lack of success in the post-war years and serious financial troubles left them ripe for relocation when the game's administrators were looking to expand the competition into other states.\n\nIn 1982 South Melbourne moved to Sydney and the SCG to become the Sydney Swans. Despite their shaky financial situation, the Swans were the flavour of Sydney in the early years; the Swans matches at the SCG were the place to be seen, rivaling Sydney's main winter sport, rugby league. In the late 1980s Sydney Rules Ltd, the company which ran the licence for the club, recorded a profit of $600,000. However, when the stock market crashed in October 1987, the Swans went with it, but the Swans have since managed to hold on and have gained a foothold in Sydney.\n[[File:Sydney Cricket Ground September 2018.jpg|thumb|right|View towards the members stands as seen during the 2018 second elimination final between the Swans and the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|Giants]]]]\nThe SCG most notably hosted Sydney's preliminary final against {{AFL Ess}} in 1996, in which full forward [[Tony Lockett]] scored a behind [[after-the-siren kicks in Australian rules football|after the final siren]] to give Sydney a one-point win, sending the Swans into their first grand final since 1945. Between 2003 and 2015, most Sydney Swans home finals had been played at the larger [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] unless it was otherwise booked. Since 2016, all Swans home finals (with the exception of a Sydney Derby in 2016) have been played at the SCG.\n\nIn 1999, the SCG witnessed its only modern-day [[pitch invasion]] when Tony Lockett kicked his 1300th career goal to become the highest goalkicker in VFL/AFL history.\n\nOn 9 September 2017, the largest ever crowd to watch an Australian Rules game at the SCG, 46,323, came to see the Swans defeat [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in an Elimination Final.\n\nThe SCG was the shortest field used for AFL games, at 153 metres long, but Geelong's [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Kardinia Park]] is narrower. However recent works on the Northern Stand facilitated an extension of the playing surface means it is no longer the shortest ground in the league.\n\n==Other sports==\nThe SCG has been a popular arena for a whole range of sports before the turn of the 20th century including cricket, tennis, baseball, soccer and cycling with athletics being staged there as early as 1879. On New Year's Day, 1880, possibly some of the most exotic sports ever seen at the SCG were staged when the 12th Annual [[Highlands Games]] was held. Organised by the Scottish community events included [[Caber toss|tossing the caber]], [[Stone put|putting the stone]] and other traditional Highland sports as well as [[Highland dancing]]. A crowd of 5000 attended. On 5 May 1964, 51,566 [[soccer]] fans came to the SCG to see NSW take on English club [[Everton F.C.]]. In 1974 the Socceroos defeated Uruguay 2-0 in front of a capacity crowd in a friendly match before the World Cup Finals. It was announced in April 2018 that [[Sydney FC]] will stage 6 of their 13 home matches in the 2019-2020 A-League season with the other 7 games to be split between [[Jubilee Oval]] and [[Leichhardt Oval]] while the Sydney Football Stadium is demolished and rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/sydney-fc-to-play-half-their-home-games-at-scg-next-season-20180405-p4z7zn.html|title=Sydney FC to play half their home games at SCG next season|last=Bossi|first=Dominic|date=2018-04-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> Sydney FC played their first game at the SCG on 27 October 2018 against rivals [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC]] in front of 30,688 fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.austadiums.com/sport/event.php?eventid=20888|title=A-League: Sydney FC v Western Sydney Wanderers {{!}} Austadiums|website=www.austadiums.com|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===US Major League Baseball \u2013 22/23 March 2014===\n[[File:Major League Baseball at Sydney Cricket Ground, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Major League Baseball starts its [[2014 Major League Baseball season|2014 season]] at the Sydney Cricket Ground]]\nIn June 2013, [[Major League Baseball]], the [[New South Wales Government]], and the Sydney Cricket Ground announced that the season opening first two games of the 2014 MLB season would be played at the SCG between the [[2014 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[2014 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], on Saturday 22 March (7pm [[AEST]] / 0800 [[UTC]] / 1am PDT) and Sunday 23 March (1pm AEST / 0200 UTC / 7pm PDT Saturday 22 March) 2014.<ref name=\"SCG-MLD2014\">[http://www.sydneycricketground.com.au/latest-news/scgbaseball/ The SCG attracts $310 million of Major League Baseball talent] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112531/http://www.sydneycricketground.com.au/latest-news/scgbaseball/ |date=24 September 2015 }}, Sydney Cricket Ground, 13 June 2013, accessed 17 June 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/scg-to-host-la-dodgers-and-arizona-diamondbacks/story-e6frg7mf-1226663056565 SCG to host LA Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks], [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]&ndash;[[The Australian]], 13 June 2013, accessed 17 June 2013</ref><ref name=\"2014_MLB_opener\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130612&content_id=50446004&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb Dodgers, D-backs to open 2014 season in Australia \u2013 Two-game series in Sydney first regular-season games to be played in that country], [[Major League Baseball]], 12 June 2013, accessed 17 June 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasordaslair.com/2012/10/24/the-dodgers-down-under/ |title=The Dodgers Down Under? |website=lasordaslair.com |last=Wheeler |first=Stacie |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref>\n \nThe Northern Stand was completed for the [[2013\u201314 Ashes series]], and provided the main stand behind [[home plate]], with premium seating.

Until the 44,000 seat Sydney Football Stadium opened in 1988, the Sydney Cricket Ground was the major rugby league venue in Sydney.\n\n==History==\n=== Beginning ===\nIn 1811, the Governor of New South Wales, [[Lachlan Macquarie]], established the second Sydney Common, about one-and-a-half miles (about 2,400m) wide and extending south from South Head Road (now [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford St]]) to where [[Randwick Racecourse]] is today. Part sandhills, part swamp and situated on the south-eastern fringe of the city, it was used as a rubbish dump in the 1850s, and not regarded as an ideal place for sport. In 1851, part of the Sydney Common south of [[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]] was granted to the [[British Army]] for use as a garden and [[cricket]] ground for the soldiers. Its first user was the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th North Devonshire Regiment]] which flattened and graded the southern part of the rifle range adjacent to the Barracks.\n\nIn the next couple of years, the teams from Victoria Barracks combined themselves into a more permanent organisation and called themselves the Garrison Club. The ground therefore became known as the Garrison Ground when it was first opened in February 1854.\n\nUp until that time [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] had been the main sporting and racing ground in the colony but when it was dedicated as public gardens in 1856 city cricketers and footballers had to find somewhere else to play.\n\nIn the late 1860s another part of the Sydney Common, the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street, was opened for public recreation. It was named [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] after the [[Mayor of Sydney]], Charles Moore, who planted a number of [[Moreton Bay Fig]] trees which exist to this day. As well as the location of Sydney's first [[zoo]], Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs [[Sydney University]] and the Wallaroos. Sydney at the time was a small, dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts. It was not liked so much by cricketers because it was too far from the city.\n\n[[File:England v. Australia Cricket Match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, January 27 1883 - by unknown photographer (3064799664).jpg|thumb|left|England v Australia at SCG, 27 January 1883]]\nWhen the commander of the Sydney garrison, Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson, aligned his soldiers to the East Sydney Cricket Club, the Garrison Ground became known as the Civil and Military Ground. In 1870 British troops left Victoria barracks and the future of the Civil and Military Ground became uncertain. However, with the closure of the [[Albert ground sydney|Albert Ground]] in the 1870s, the [[New South Wales Cricket Association|NSW Cricket Association]] (NSWCA) began regular use of the Civil and Military Ground.\n\nIn 1875, the NSW Government began to upgrade the ground. Despite efforts by Victoria Barracks and then the Carlingford, Redfern, Fitzroy and Albert cricket clubs to take control, the then president of the NSWCA, [[Richard Driver]] (after whom Driver Avenue outside the ground is named), persuaded the government to let the NSWCA look after the ground's administration. In 1876, the ground was dedicated by Governor Sir [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Hercules Robinson]].\n\n[[File:Charles Bayliss.jpg|thumb|left|The Cricket Ground in 1892]]\nThe NSWCA had influential supporters. Driver himself was a prominent MP and solicitor for the [[City of Sydney|City of Sydney Council]]. The Minister for Lands, Thomas Garrett, was also supportive; his son was about to break into the colonial side. It is hardly surprising therefore that within a couple of years of the NSWCA taking control of the ground, the governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, appointed Driver himself, William W. Stephen and Phillip Sheridan (after whom a grandstand was named), the first trustees. Two trustees were appointed by the government and one by the NSWCA. The close relationship between the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Trust|Trust]] and the NSWCA is evidenced by the fact that they pooled funds for the next six years. The military's link with the ground was finally severed when John Richardson and the Sydney garrison went to fight in the [[Mahdist War|Sudan]]. The trustees then took the opportunity to rename the ground the Association Ground\n\nIn 1883 the most prominent trustee, Sheridan, regarding the ground as the responsibility of the trustees, began to act independently of the NSWCA, resulting in the NSWCA losing control of the ground. Over the next century there was constant conflict between the Trust and the NSWCA over whether other sports such as [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[tennis]] and [[cycling]], the organisers of which were all keen to use the venue, had access to it. One conflict in 1904, over the Trust's plan to hold a cycling event which clashed with a cricket match, ended up in court. The NSWCA's influence was eventually reduced even further over the years due to changes in the way the State Government appointed trustees.\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Scg scoreboard 1900.jpg|thumb|right|The SCG scoreboard in January 1901]]\nBy the time of the [[Cricket in Australia|first Sydney cricket test]] in February 1882, the ground could boast two grandstands; the Brewongle Stand at the southern end and the original Members' Stand, which had been built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members' Stand now sits. On opposite sides of the ground to the stands two spectator mounds were built. They became known as The Hill and the Paddington Hill.\n\nIn 1886, the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Members' Stand and Lady Members' Stand|Members' Pavilion]] was rebuilt at a cost of \u00a36,625. Membership was levied at two guineas.\n\nIn 1881 a loop in the tram line, which ran down Randwick Road (now [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]]), was built to service the Ground and the Pastoral and Agricultural Society Ground (later the RAS Showgrounds and now Fox Studios) next door.\n\nIn 1894 the ground finally received its modern name, the Sydney Cricket Ground, which was followed by the opening of the [[Hill Stand]], situated between The Hill and the Paddington Hill. It became known as the Bob Stand during the Depression years because it cost one shilling (a bob) to enter.\n\nThe first SCG [[scoreboard]] was built in the two weeks leading up to the 1895\u20131896 inter-colonial match between New South Wales and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Although it was Sheridan's idea, the design was Ned Gregory's who believed that English scoreboards were inadequate. Requiring two men to operate it, the new scoreboard was hailed as one of the wonders of the cricket world. Boards with players' names on them were placed in different slits alongside scrolls of canvas with numbers painted on them which were rolled up and down to show the changing score. Under the scoreboard was a refreshment stall which sold, among other things, [[oysters]].\n\n[[File:Cricket at the Sydney Cricket Ground, 12 December 1903.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Sydney Cricket Ground on 12 December 1903]]\nIn 1896 the [[Sydney Cricket Ground Members' Stand and Lady Members' Stand|Ladies' Stand]] was opened, along with a concrete cycling track which circled the inside of the ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article169754541 |title=AMATEUR CYCLING CARNIVAL. |newspaper=[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth (Sydney, NSW : 1894\u20131954)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=13 December 1896 |accessdate=2 June 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> One of the carpenters who built the formwork for the track was George Bradman, father of [[Don Bradman]]. In 1898 floodlights were built over the cycling track so that night events could be held. In 1904 the scoreboard was rebuilt at the top of The Hill and in 1909 the Sheridan Stand, named after Phil Sheridan, was opened at the southern end, replacing the earlier Smokers' Stand.\n\nIn the period up to World War I the SCG was used for a wide variety of sports including [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[tennis]], [[baseball]], football and cycling. The cycling track however was removed in 1920. In 1924 Ned Gregory's scoreboard was closed and the concrete scoreboard at the back of the Hill opened.\n\n[[File:Sydney Cricket Ground 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|A crowded SCG during a 1930s cricket match]]\nDuring the 1920s, and 1930s crowds packed into the SCG to see Don Bradman play for New South Wales and Australia. Many of the huge gate takings that Bradman brought in for the NSWCA were spent on developing the ground. A large new stand was built at the northern end in two stages. It replaced the Northern Stand and was intended to also replace the Members' and Ladies' Stands.  The first stage, begun while Bradman was still playing for New South Wales, was opened in 1936 at a cost of \u00a390,000 and named the 'M.A. Noble Stand' after the great Australian captain [[Monty Noble]]. The second stage, completed in 1973 at a cost of $2 million, was named the Bradman Stand after the great man himself.\n\nFurther redevelopment of the ground began in 1978 with the advent of [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) and games played at night. When media giant [[Kerry Packer]] failed to obtain the television broadcast rights for cricket, he bought the top 30\u201340 players in the world and staged his own competition, World Series Cricket.\n\nPacker applied to use the SCG for WSC in 1977 but the SCG Trust, which administered the ground, refused. However the NSW Labor Government, under Premier [[Neville Wran]], amended the ''Sydney Sports Ground and Cricket Ground Act'' to remove the Trust's power to decide who played at the SCG and the NSWCA's traditional right over the ground. A new Trust was established with 12 members appointed by the Government and two elected by SCG members. The new Trust had no WSC opponents, and although legal action by the NSWCA stopped WSC games being played at the SCG in 1977, they were played there in 1978.\n\n[[File:Scg scoreboard 1950.jpg|thumb|left|The SCG scoreboard in 1950]] \nIn the years since WSC the character of the SCG has somewhat changed. Six light towers were built in 1978 at a cost of $1.2 million so that cricket could be played at night, and two huge new stands were constructed at the southern end of the ground. The new Brewongle Stand was built on the site of the old Brewongle Stand at a cost $8.9 million and opened in 1980. The Churchill Stand, named after rugby league legend [[Clive Churchill]], replaced the Sheridan Stand at a cost of $8.2 million and was opened in 1986.\n\nThe old concrete scoreboard was closed in 1983 and a new electronic board erected above The Hill. This board allowed the crowd to see video replays and provided more scope for advertising. The old concrete scoreboard sat behind the Doug Walters Stand unused until 2006 when it was dismantled and stored offsite to make way for the Victor Trumper Stand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-13/old-scg-cricket-scoreboard-where-is-it-curious-sydney/9371316|title=Iconic SCG cricket scoreboard returns to Sydney home|date=2018-09-13|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\nThe Bob Stand has been moved to [[North Sydney Oval]], replaced by the [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] Stand. This stand was originally named the Pat Hills Stand, after the [[Pat Hills|NSW Labor Government Minister and SCG Trust member]], when it was opened in 1984. However, the incoming [[Nick Greiner|Greiner Government]] changed the name to the O'Reilly Stand after the legendary spin bowler.\n\nThe Hill also has gone but the reason for that is a little harder to pin. Up until 1991 the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and attracting [[working class]] patronage. The invention of the [[Beverage can|beer can]] and the portable [[cooler]] in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of [[limited overs cricket|limited overs]] games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill in 1991<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=276|title=Over the hill: an era ends at the SCG {{!}} Austadiums|website=austadiums.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.\n\n[[File:Moore Park Sydney Cricket Ground 1.JPG|thumb|Sydney Cricket Ground members entrance, 2007]]\nFurther developments have taken place in more recent years with the internal reconstruction of the M.A. Noble stand completed in 1994 and the opening of the NSW Cricket Centre in 1997. This facility includes indoor training wickets and administrative offices for Cricket NSW (formerly NSW Cricket Association). In 1999 the original electronic scoreboard was replaced by a new higher-definition video screen. In the 21st Century the Hill has been completely redeveloped with a new 12,000 seat [[Victor Trumper]] Stand, completed in 2008. This stand brings the SCG's capacity to 46,000 spectators. During the re-development, the 2 original light towers on the hill were replaced and the 4 other light towers were upgraded,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=328|title=It's all looking bright for the SCG {{!}} Austadiums|website=austadiums.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> a new video screen was also installed in the Clive Churchill stand, replacing the screen that was on the hill.\n\nThe SCG Trust rebuilt the MA Noble, Don Bradman and Dally Messenger stands for the [[2013\u201314 Ashes series]], it increased ground capacity to 48,000 spectators. This redevelopment was mostly completed in March 2014 at a cost of $197.5 million and also included a large new video screen.\n\nIn September 2018, construction began on a new video screen to replace the video screen at the Messenger Stand with the LED panels for the screen transferred across from the Sydney Football Stadium with an upgrade to the video screen in the Clive Churchill Stand and new LED advertising banners being installed in all of the stands except for the Members and Ladies pavilions. The work was completed in time for [[Sydney FC]]'s first ever A-League game at the SCG.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=621|title=New SCG scoreboard debuts as soccer returns|work=Austadiums|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, the Trust are keen on redeveloping the Bill O'Reilly stand, and later the Churchill and Brewongle stands, further increasing the grounds capacity. The ground will be a near complete modern \"bowl\" stadium with the exception of the two heritage listed Members and Ladies pavilions.\n\n==Stands==\nIn its present configuration, the SCG is a playing field surrounded by a collection of separate grandstand structures. From the northern end, clockwise, they are:\n*[[Monty Noble|M.A Noble]], [[Don Bradman|Bradman]] and [[Dally Messenger|Messenger]] stands \u2013 Constructed in 2013/2014. The stand contains corporate boxes, media facilities and members seating for Trust members and in the winter for eligible Swans members. The Messenger Stand is also home to the main video screen for the ground. \n*[[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] Stand (previously named [[Pat Hills]] Stand) \u2013 Built 1984 \u2013 Corporate boxes and public reserved seating.\n*[[Victor Trumper]] Stand \u2013 Constructed in 2007/2008, replaced Yabba's Hill and Doug Walters Stand, corporate boxes and public reserved seating.\n*[[Clive Churchill]] Stand \u2013 Built 1986 \u2013 Corporate boxes and public reserved seating.

Although games were played at the [[The Domain, Sydney|Domain]], the Garrison Ground was used for practice by the NSW cricket team in 1860 and by the Victorian team in 1861 the before inter-colonial matches in those years.\n\nCricket was first played in Australia in Sydney's Hyde Park in 1803. However, up until the appointment of trustees to look after the SCG in the late 1870s, several different grounds had been used. The Domain was first used for inter-colonial games and then the Albert Ground in Redfern but in time both became unavailable, the Domain because of its poor condition and because it could not be fenced in and the Albert Ground because it closed in the late 1870s.\n\nAfter the closure of the Albert Ground the New South Wales Cricket Association began using the Association Ground. The first game played there was the final of the Civil Service Challenge Cup on 25 October 1877, between the New South Wales Government Printing Office and the Audit Office. The first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match was the inter-colonial game between New South Wales and Victoria played on 22, 23 and 25 February 1878 where New South Wales won by 1 wicket.<ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales vs. Victoria, 1877\u201378|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1870S/1877-78/AUS_LOCAL/NSW_VIC_22-25FEB1878.html|website=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n{{main|Sydney Riot of 1879}}\nDuring the 1878\u201379 season [[Lord Harris]]' England team toured Australia. The feature of the tourists game against New South Wales at the SCG in 1879 was a riot sparked apparently when the crowd disagreed with an umpiring decision by [[George Coulthard]] that went against the locals. Lord Harris believed the invasion of the ground by about 2000 spectators was actually started by bookmakers in the stand. One of the umpires for the match was [[Edmund Barton]], later to become Australia's first Prime Minister.\n\nBy the time the first test was played at the SCG between 17 February and 21 February 1882 the ground was in fine condition. The NSWCA had appointed Ned Gregory as curator and given him a cottage next to the ground for him and his family. Australia won that game by overhauling England's scores of 133 and 232 with scores of 197 and 5 for 169.\n\nThe ground high score in Test cricket was held for more than a century by Englishman [[R. E. Foster|Reg \"Tip\" Foster]], who scored 287 in an Australia-England match in 1903. In the 100th test to be played at the SCG in January 2012, [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was joined first by [[Ricky Ponting]] in a partnership of 288 and then by [[Michael Hussey]] in a partnership of 334 and built a score of 329 not out against India.<ref>{{cite news|last = Jackson|first = Glenn|date = 5 January 2012|title = Advantage Australia as Clarke's triple ton puts hosts in box seat|url = http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/advantage-australia-as-clarkes-triple-ton-puts-hosts-in-box-seat-20120105-1pm0m.html|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate = 5 January 2012|publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Don Bradman]] made his first visit to the ground in the 1920\u201321 season to watch the Fifth Test of the Australia and England series. In that game [[Charlie Macartney]] scored 170 to help seal a win for Australia.\n\nBradman scored the highest ever first-class innings of 452 at the SCG for New South Wales against Queensland in 1928\u201329. This record was surpassed by [[Hanif Mohammad]] who scored 499 run out. It was further bettered by the West Indian [[Brian Lara]] who scored 501 in 1994.\n\nThe 1928\u201329 season was a big one for cricket. On 15 December, the largest ever crowd to attend a cricket match at the SCG, 58,446, saw Australia and England play. With changes to the ground seating the record is unlikely to be beaten.\n\n[[File:Sydney Cricket Ground, Warne final balls, 2007.jpg|thumb|Shane Warne is pictured bowling one of his last balls in Test cricket]]\n[[File:Pm cricket shots09 6040.jpg|thumb|left|South Africa playing against Australia in 2009]]\nIn the last test of the 1970\u201371 English tour, England fast bowler [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] struck Australian spinner and tailender [[Terry Jenner]] on the head with a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]. The Sydney crowd let Snow and the English know they were not happy with his behaviour and when Snow took up his fielding position on the fence a spectator spoke to him and grabbed him by the shirt. Cans were thrown onto the field and England captain [[Ray Illingworth]] took his team from the ground.\n\nThe first women's club cricket match was held at the SCG in 1886 when the Fernleas played the Siroccos. Although cricket was not seen as an appropriate game for women, women's cricket associations were formed in Victoria in 1905 and other states in the 1920s, and 1930s.\n\nNight cricket was first played at the SCG on 28 November 1978 with World Series Cricket. A crowd of 50,000 packed the ground.\n\nThe SCG was the scene of [[Shane Warne]]'s first (1992) and final tests (2007). In 2007, [[Justin Langer]] and [[Glenn McGrath]] also played their final tests.\n\n[[File:Australia won the Ashes 5-0.jpg|thumb|Celebrations at the SCG after Australia won the Ashes 5-0 in 2014]]\n\nDuring the 100th Test match held at SCG, on 3 January 2012, [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] scored his maiden triple century against India and was the first player to do so at the ground. Exactly nine years before, [[Steve Waugh]] scored a century to retain The Ashes, and it was also the scene of his final test against India in 2004.\n\nThe SCG was venue of two 5-0 [[The Ashes|Ashes Series]] clean sweeps (completed in early 2007 and 2014).\n\nSCG is the traditional ground for hosting New Year tests, as well as the traditional final match of the Australian Ashes Series. Since 2008, the New Year Test has also been names the Pink Test, organised by [[Glenn McGrath]] and the McGrath Foundation \u2013 named for his late wife, [[Jane McGrath]] to raise [[breast cancer awareness]], and on the third day, even if the day's play is rained out, is named Pink Day, or Jane McGrath Day in her honour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketaustralia.com.au/cricket-cares/mcgrath-foundation|title=McGrath Foundation {{!}} Cricket Australia|website=www.cricketaustralia.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe SCG was the scene of tragedy on 25 November 2014, when a bouncer from [[Sean Abbott]] struck [[Phillip Hughes]]'s neck, knocking him unconscious.

Between 1913 and 1987, the [[NSWRFL Premiership]] Final was always played at the SCG, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. Due to the ground's historical significance to rugby league, it is often used for special heritage matches for [[National Rugby League]] club and representative matches. \n \n[[Rugby league]] was first played at the SCG on 22 June 1911 between [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15230859 |title=The Rugby League: Cricket Ground Secured |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 May 1911 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The ground was first used by the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] in 1913. At this time the Trust only gave players access to dressing sheds in the Sheridan Stand and did not allow use of the rooms in the Member's Stand. This rule was relaxed in 1918. The [[1915 NSWRFL season]]'s first round match between defending premiers [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] and [[Glebe (rugby league team)|Glebe]] was played in front of a record crowd of 13,000.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haddan|first1=Stephen|title=History of the NSW Rugby League Finals|date=1991|location=Australia|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8yLwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2014|isbn=9780646050980}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1920 Great Britain Lions tour]] saw the British rugby league team tour Australia for the first time since World War I and huge crowds attended their games. The first match of the tour was at the SCG against [[City New South Wales rugby league team|Metropolis]] in front of nearly 68,000 spectators. Australia won the first Test in [[Brisbane]] and in the second Test at the SCG on 3 July. The Australians sealed the series, scoring five tries to win 21\u20138 and secure the [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes series]] for the first time at home.\n\nThe attendance record for a rugby league match in Australia was broken in 1932 when 70,204 people saw Australia play England in the first test of the [[1932 Rugby League Ashes series|1932 Ashes series]] at the Cricket Ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21967053 |title=World's Record Crowd. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |location=Qld. |date=7 June 1932 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> It was also in this game that the Australians first wore the green jersey with a double gold 'V', which they have been wearing ever since. The English side boasted one of the great rugby league back lines consisting of captain [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] (fullback), [[Alf Ellaby]] and [[Stanley Smith (rugby league born c. 1910)|Stan Smith]] (wings), and [[Artie Atkinson]] and [[Stan Brogden]] in the centres. The gates of the SCG had to be closed to prevent another 15,000 people from entering. Australia lost the game 8\u20136. The second game was the famous \"[[1932 Great Britain Lions tour#Battle of Brisbane 1932|Battle of Brisbane]]\" Test, which Australia won. In the third Test back at the SCG Australia lead 11\u20133 until late in the game. Incredibly, England scored three quick tries to snatch the game (18\u201313) and the series. The attendance of the first test stood as the highest recorded crowd for an international rugby league match until 73,631 fans attended the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup final|1992 World Cup Final]] between Australia and [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at the famous [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London, England.\n\n[[File:SCG rugby league match 1950.JPG|thumb|left|Unrecognizable after playing on a muddy SCG, footballers of the [[Great Britain Lions|British]] and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] national rugby league sides leave the field after the first Test on 12 June 1950.]]The next tour by England was in 1946, knows as The \"Indomitables\" tour due to the Great Britain team traveling to Australia on the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Indomitable (92)|HMS Indomitable]]. The first test played on 17 June was an 8 \u2013 8 draw, the opening try of the series was scored by the legendary [[Frank Whitcombe]] for the tourists, in front of a crowd of 64,527. England went on to win The Ashes. In 1950 Australia had not won a series against the team Lions for 30 years but this time there was a big change. Britain had won the first Test and Australia the second, which made the third SCG Test the decider. The tour coincided with a record amount of rain and by the time the teams arrived the SCG was a mud heap. Forty tonnes of soil were brought in and spread over the surface to try and dry it out. Tied 2\u20132 at half time, Australia scored the only try of the match late in the second half when winger [[Ron Roberts (rugby league)|Ron Roberts]] crossed in the corner to seal the win. At the end of the game the crowd of over 47,000 jumped the fence and invaded the field and congregated in front of the Members Stand cheering and calling for Aussie captain [[Clive Churchill]].\n\nThe [[1963 NSWRFL Grand Final]] was won by the [[St. George Dragons]] 8\u20133 in front of 69,860 fans in atrocious conditions. It was the Dragons eighth consecutive premiership and their third consecutive grand final win against the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]. The match's only try, scored by Dragons winger [[Johnny King]], was clouded in controversy after he appeared to be tackled when a defender knocked him flat on the ground, only to get up and carry the ball to the try line under howls of protest from Wests players who believe that the referee had called King to play the ball. That try became the centre of furore when rumors spread that match referee Darcy Lawler had bet on St. George to win (Wests captain [[Arthur Summons]] later claimed one of his players announced to his teammates before the game that any who had bet on the Magpies to win had better lay off their bets as referee Lawler had backed St. George). After the match, photographer John O'Gready took the iconic rugby league photograph, \"The Gladiators\", depicting Arthur Summons supporting St. George captain [[Norm Provan]]. The photo of Summons and Provan was later used as the basis for the [[Winfield Cup]] trophy, and continues to be used to this day with the [[National Rugby League]]'s [[Telstra]] Premiership Trophy.\n\nOn 18 September 1965, the largest ever official crowd at the SCG, 78,056, saw St George defeat the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] 12\u20138 in the [[1965 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|NSWRFL grand final]]. Gates were ordered to be closed two hours before the game began and children were allowed to sit inside the fence. Contemporary accounts indicate that many more \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 gained other means of access and sat on grandstand roofs or went into the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)]] and viewed the match from the stairways and roof of the main pavilion. Estimates from people there that day put the crowd as high as 90,000. This would stand as the largest rugby league crowd in Australia until Game 2 of the [[1994 State of Origin series]] when 87,161 attended the game at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Due to the overcrowding of the ground during the grand final, the [[New South Wales Police Force]] imposed a 70,000 capacity limit on the Cricket Ground for safety reasons.\n\nThe SCG hosted the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup Final]], won 20\u20132 by the [[Johnny Raper]] led Australians over [[France national rugby league team|France]] in front of 54,290. The Australian team that day, coached by [[Harry Bath]], boasted legends of the Australian game in Raper (Lock), [[Eric Simms (rugby league)|Eric Simms]] (Fullback), [[Graeme Langlands]] and [[Johnny Greaves (rugby league)|Johnny Greaves]] (centres), [[Bob Fulton]] (Five-eighth), [[Billy Smith (rugby league)|Billy Smith]] (halfback), [[Arthur Beetson]] (prop) and [[Dick Thornett]] and [[Ron Coote]] (second-row). Although the Final attracted over 54,000 fans, this was actually not the highest attendance of the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968 World Cup]]. That came during the opening game of the tournament when 62,256 saw Australia defeat Great Britain 25-10. This would stand as the highest attendance for a World Cup match until 73,631 attended the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|1992 World Cup Final]] to see Australia again defeat Great Britain 10-6 at the famous [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]].\n\nOne of the most courageous efforts at the SCG was [[John Sattler]]'s performance in the [[NSWRFL season 1970#Grand Final|1970 grand final]] between South Sydney and the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate [[Michael Cleary (rugby)|Michael Cleary]], asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates not to take the field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23\u201312 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.\n\nThe Cricket Ground hosted what many consider to be the toughest grand final of all in [[1973 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1973]] when defending premiers Manly-Warringah faced the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], who were playing in their first ever grand final after joining the competition in [[1967 NSWRFL season|1967]]. The Sharks were Captain-coached by Great Britain halfback [[Tommy Bishop]] and had a forward pack led by his tough [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] and GB teammate [[Cliff Watson]] and [[Rothmans Medal|1973 Rothmans Medallist]] [[Ken Maddison]], along with goal kicking 18-year-old whiz-kid centre [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]]. Manly were coached by [[Ron Willey]] and captained by tough hooker [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Freddy Jones]], and could boast internationals [[Ken Irvine]], [[Ray Branighan]], Bob Fulton, [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]], British lock [[Mal Reilly|Malcolm Reilly]], as well as tough tackling second-row forward [[Terry Randall]] and 19-year-old fullback [[Graham Eadie]]. From the opening kick off the game descended into a series of high or late tackles and several all-in brawls, though surprisingly referee Keith Page didn't send any player off, despite threatening to do so and repeatedly handing out cautions, including twice to all 26 players on the field. In the opening minutes of the game, Mal Reilly was felled in back play by Cronulla hooker [[Ron Turner (rugby league)|Ron \"Rocky\" Turner]] well after he kicked the ball and, after writhing on the ground in agony with a badly bruised hip, left the field for a pain killing injection. When he returned he created mayhem with strong-arm tactics, although he was clearly out of sorts football wise and was replaced after just 25 minutes by John Bucknell. In the end, the difference between the two teams was Manly's international centre Bob Fulton who scored two tries in leading Manly to a 10\u20137 win. The game was described by [[Sunday Telegraph]] writer Ian Heads as ''\"A grand final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl\"''.<ref>Sydney Sunday Telegraph, 16 September 1973</ref>\n\nIn 1975, in one of the most memorable [[1975 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|grand finals]] ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] coached [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters]], defeated St. George 38\u20130 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the [[2008 NRL Grand Final]] played between Manly Warringah and the [[Melbourne Storm]], Manly winning by the tune of 40\u20130. However, the game was famous for reasons other than the scoreline. St George's Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback [[Russell Fairfax]] and centre [[Mark Harris (rugby league)|Mark Harris]], and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void \u2013 [[John Rheinberger]] \u2013 who played in his first only first grade game in the grand final. Leading by only 5\u20130 at half-time, the Roosters scored an avalanche of tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club \u2013 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters' eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.\n\nThe SCG hosted its second Rugby League World Cup Final in [[1977 Rugby League World Cup Final|1977]]. On 25 June Australia defeated Great Britain 13-12 in front of just 24,457 fans. The match was highlighted by a 60-metre try to Manly-Warringah centre [[Russel Gartner]] who outpaced the Lions chasers late in the first half to give Australia an 8-5 lead. This would prove to be (as of 2016) the last World Cup game played at the SCG.\n\nIn [[1981 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1981]], another memorable and emotional rugby league grand final was played at the SCG. Since joining the Sydney Premiership in [[1947 NSWRFL season|1947]], the [[Parramatta Eels]] had not won a grand final. In [[1976 NSWRFL season|1976]] and [[1977 NSWRFL season|1977]] it had suffered consecutive losses, first to Manly-Warringah (who also joined the league in 1947) and then St George in the first replayed grand final. In 1981, the Eels 'dream team' (another team coached by Jack Gibson), comprising internationals [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]], [[Ron Hilditch]] and [[Bob O'Reilly|Bob \"The Bear\" O'Reilly]], as well as budding stars [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Steve Ella]], [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[John Muggleton]], outscored the [[Tommy Raudonikis]] captained [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]] four tries to three to win 20\u201311 and secure their first premiership. Playing second-row for Newtown that day was future dual grand final winning, and [[New South Wales rugby league team|NSW]] State of Origin coach [[Phil Gould]]. Financial pressures at the Newtown club would result in the Jets competing in the New South Wales Rugby League first grade competition for only two seasons following their 1981 grand final appearance.\n\nThe [[1986 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1986 NSWRL Grand Final]] at the SCG between the [[John Monie]] coached Parramatta and defending premiers [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]], coached by [[Warren Ryan]], and played in front of one of the smallest grand final crowds in years (45,843), would go down as the lowest scoring and only try-less grand final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4\u20132 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), at the time the record number of points scored in a career.\n\nThe last ever rugby league grand final played at the Cricket Ground was the [[1987 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1987 decider]] between the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the [[Canberra Raiders]], who had joined the premiership in [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]]. In front of 50,201 fans on an unseasonably warm day in Sydney, the Sea Eagles ran out 18\u20138 winners, scoring two tries to one with dual rugby international [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] scoring 14 of Manly's points with a try and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Manly's other try scorer that day, Five-eighth [[Cliff Lyons]] won the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] as the man of the match.\n\nThe ground lost the grand final and numerous games to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (SFS) in [[1988 NSWRL season|1988]]. Even so, between 1988 and 2018 the ground continued to host occasional [[National Rugby League]] matches,<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Matthew|date=22 May 2009|url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=33331|title=SCG Magic offers the NRL one big positive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210064606/http://rleague.com/db/article.php?id=33331|archivedate=10 February 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-25/tigers-again-to-call-scg-home/2351096 Tigers again to call SCG home] (25 November 2010)</ref> mostly featuring the Heritage round game between [[St George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]] and [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and the [[2008 Centenary Rugby League Test|2008 Centenary]] [[ANZAC Test]] between Australia and New Zealand, in what was the first test held at the famous old ground since the [[Wally Lewis]] captained Australians had defeated the Kiwis 29\u201312 on [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series|19 July 1986]] in front of 34,302 fans.

All colonies of Australia were well established when the final versions of the rules of the game were codified by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1875 and by the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] in 1877 when it held its first tournament at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].\n\nTennis was regularly played at the SCG in the early days. The Sydney tournament which was to become the [[New South Wales Open]], was first played at the SCG in 1885 before moving to the NSW Lawn Tennis Club's courts at Double Bay, then to [[White City Stadium (Sydney)|White City]] and later to the [[NSW Tennis Centre|Olympic Tennis Centre]] at [[Homebush Bay]]. The SCG was the host of the [[1908 Australasian Championships]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10192715 |title=Lawn Tennis. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=19,468 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=10 December 1908 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Motor racing==\nIn 1898, Sydney cycle firm, Gavin Gibson Ltd, imported seven motorised tricycles produced by Count [[Jules-Albert de Dion]] and powered by one cylinder petrol engines designed by his partner [[Georges Bouton]]. On the evening of 1 January 1901, these seven machines raced around the concrete cycle track which ringed the inside of the SCG in those days to compete in Australia's first ever motor race.\n\n==Empire Games==\nThe SCG was the main stadium for the [[1938 British Empire Games]] which were tied into the State's sesqui-centenary celebrations. Perhaps because of this the Federal Government provided no money and only \u00a310,000 came from the State Government to cover the organising committee's administrative costs. The budget was therefore, very tight and using the existing SCG was one way of making ends meet. Cyclist Edgar \"Dunc\" Gray led the teams onto the ground and athletes ran on a makeshift grass track.\n\n==Rugby union==\nClub rugby was first played at the then Civil and Military Ground as early as 1870, and the first inter-colonial game was played there in 1882. NSW beat [[Queensland]] 28\u20134. From June 1911 the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSW Rugby League]] had exclusive use of the SCG, as well as the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] and the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]], preventing rugby union games from being played there. Over the years the SCG hosted 71 rugby union tests before Sydney international matches were moved first to Waratah Rugby Park ([[Concord Oval]]), then the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] and later [[Stadium Australia]]. The largest ever crowd to watch a rugby union match at the SCG was 49,327 who saw NSW played [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] on 13 July 1907.\n\nOf those 71 tests none could have been more dramatic than the game against the South African [[Springboks]] on 7 August 1971. Marred by anti-[[apartheid]] protests, field invasions and objects being thrown onto the ground and halted several times to remove golf balls and protestors, it was won by South Africa who went through the tour undefeated.\n\nThe SCG has been both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst incidents to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped on the bottom of a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.\n\nDramatic though that game was, no test could have been as important in the development of [[Australian Rugby Union]] than the game against the touring [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh]] team in 1978.\n\nThe 1978 Welsh had arrived in Australia as (the then) [[Rugby Union Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] Champions, [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]] winners, the best rugby union team in the world but they were a sad and sorry bunch by the time they got to Sydney for the last game of the tour, the second test. The team was decimated by injuries and in two earlier tour games had suffered a last minute loss to Sydney and a humiliating defeat midweek to the [[ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union|Australian Capital Territory]].\n\nRumours abounded that the Welsh were ready for a big 'get square' with Australian prop Steve Finnane, the so-called 'enforcer' of the Australian team. Finnane and other senior members of the team had vowed to avenge the defeat of the Australians by the Welsh on their last tour of the UK several years before. The SCG crowd didn't have long to wait because after the very first scrum Welsh prop [[Graham Price]] came out holding his bloodied jaw, the victim of a Finnane punch. Price had bored in on Finnane, his opposite number in the front row and Finnane reacted.\n\nAfter Price left the field and the game continued for a short while until the Welsh, using a pre-determined code word, sparked an all-in-brawl. Wales lost the test and the two-test series.\n\nIn 1979 there was a one-off game against the [[All Blacks]] at the SCG. The kicking of a young five-eighth named Tony Melrose closed out the New Zealanders and Australia won a try-less game 12\u20136, to take back the [[Bledisloe Cup]] for the first time since 1949. The following year the Australians showed it was no fluke by beating New Zealand two tests to one in Australia to successfully defend the trophy for the first time.\n\nOn 14 April 2018 the [[NSW Waratahs]] played a home game at the SCG against the [[Queensland Reds]] in the Waratahs first appearance at the ground in 35 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com.au/rugby/story/_/id/23109528/waratahs-not-inspired-scg-rich-rugby-history-growden|title=Waratahs can't not be inspired by SCG history|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://austadiums.com/sport/event.php?eventid=20704|title=Super Rugby: Waratahs v Reds {{!}} Austadiums|website=austadiums.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2019 Super Rugby season]] the Waratahs will stage 3 of their home games at the SCG while the Sydney Football Stadium is rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scgt.nsw.gov.au/sydney-cricket-ground/whats-on/news/waratahs-to-play-three-blockbuster-games-at-scg/|title=Waratahs to play three blockbuster games at SCG|website=www.scgt.nsw.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Australian rules football==\n[[File:05129r.jpg|thumb|right|A New South Wales player marks over a West Australian opponent in the goal square at the 1933 [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|Australian Football Carnival]]. The old [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] is in the background]]\nThe first [[Australian rules football]] match to be played at the SCG was [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|Inter-Colonial]] football match played between Victoria and New South Wales on 6 August 1881.\n\n[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] played a premiership match at Moore Park in 1904 in front of the Governor General and Governor of NSW. Melbourne won and both teams had to return home by boat down the coast; two other matches (Fitzroy v Collingwood and Geelong v Carlton, which had been postponed) were also played there in 1903. In 1922, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] played a combined New South Wales side on the ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article106674362 |title=FOOTBALL |newspaper=[[The Herald (Adelaide)|Daily Herald]] |volume=XIII |issue=3879 |location=South Australia |date=24 August 1922 |accessdate=22 July 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the ground was rarely used for Australian Rules, except for the occasional exhibition match or interstate football carnival.\n\nRichmond played Collingwood there in 1952, and eight VFL matches were played there in 1979\u20131981, but Australian rules football was not to make a regular comeback to the SCG until 1982, when [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] relocated to Sydney and made the SCG its home ground.\n\n===Sydney Swans===\n{{Main|Sydney Swans}}\n\n[[File:Marking contest between the Sydney Swans and Western Bulldogs @ SCG.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sydney Swans]] playing the [[Western Bulldogs]] at the SCG in 2008]]\nSouth Melbourne was formed in 1867, a foundation member of the first Australian rules competition the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) and also its later replacement the [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL). The club won five premierships with the VFA up to 1890 and three more in the VFL in the first half of the 20th Century, but a lack of success in the post-war years and serious financial troubles left them ripe for relocation when the game's administrators were looking to expand the competition into other states.\n\nIn 1982 South Melbourne moved to Sydney and the SCG to become the Sydney Swans. Despite their shaky financial situation, the Swans were the flavour of Sydney in the early years; the Swans matches at the SCG were the place to be seen, rivaling Sydney's main winter sport, rugby league. In the late 1980s Sydney Rules Ltd, the company which ran the licence for the club, recorded a profit of $600,000. However, when the stock market crashed in October 1987, the Swans went with it, but the Swans have since managed to hold on and have gained a foothold in Sydney.\n[[File:Sydney Cricket Ground September 2018.jpg|thumb|right|View towards the members stands as seen during the 2018 second elimination final between the Swans and the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|Giants]]]]\nThe SCG most notably hosted Sydney's preliminary final against {{AFL Ess}} in 1996, in which full forward [[Tony Lockett]] scored a behind [[after-the-siren kicks in Australian rules football|after the final siren]] to give Sydney a one-point win, sending the Swans into their first grand final since 1945. Between 2003 and 2015, most Sydney Swans home finals had been played at the larger [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] unless it was otherwise booked. Since 2016, all Swans home finals (with the exception of a Sydney Derby in 2016) have been played at the SCG.\n\nIn 1999, the SCG witnessed its only modern-day [[pitch invasion]] when Tony Lockett kicked his 1300th career goal to become the highest goalkicker in VFL/AFL history.\n\nOn 9 September 2017, the largest ever crowd to watch an Australian Rules game at the SCG, 46,323, came to see the Swans defeat [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in an Elimination Final.\n\nThe SCG was the shortest field used for AFL games, at 153 metres long, but Geelong's [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Kardinia Park]] is narrower. However recent works on the Northern Stand facilitated an extension of the playing surface means it is no longer the shortest ground in the league.\n\n==Other sports==\nThe SCG has been a popular arena for a whole range of sports before the turn of the 20th century including cricket, tennis, baseball, soccer and cycling with athletics being staged there as early as 1879. On New Year's Day, 1880, possibly some of the most exotic sports ever seen at the SCG were staged when the 12th Annual [[Highlands Games]] was held. Organised by the Scottish community events included [[Caber toss|tossing the caber]], [[Stone put|putting the stone]] and other traditional Highland sports as well as [[Highland dancing]]. A crowd of 5000 attended. On 5 May 1964, 51,566 [[soccer]] fans came to the SCG to see NSW take on English club [[Everton F.C.]]. In 1974 the Socceroos defeated Uruguay 2-0 in front of a capacity crowd in a friendly match before the World Cup Finals. It was announced in April 2018 that [[Sydney FC]] will stage 6 of their 13 home matches in the 2019-2020 A-League season with the other 7 games to be split between [[Jubilee Oval]] and [[Leichhardt Oval]] while the Sydney Football Stadium is demolished and rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/sydney-fc-to-play-half-their-home-games-at-scg-next-season-20180405-p4z7zn.html|title=Sydney FC to play half their home games at SCG next season|last=Bossi|first=Dominic|date=2018-04-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> Sydney FC played their first game at the SCG on 27 October 2018 against rivals [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC]] in front of 30,688 fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.austadiums.com/sport/event.php?eventid=20888|title=A-League: Sydney FC v Western Sydney Wanderers {{!}} Austadiums|website=www.austadiums.com|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===US Major League Baseball \u2013 22/23 March 2014===\n[[File:Major League Baseball at Sydney Cricket Ground, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Major League Baseball starts its [[2014 Major League Baseball season|2014 season]] at the Sydney Cricket Ground]]\nIn June 2013, [[Major League Baseball]], the [[New South Wales Government]], and the Sydney Cricket Ground announced that the season opening first two games of the 2014 MLB season would be played at the SCG between the [[2014 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[2014 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], on Saturday 22 March (7pm [[AEST]] / 0800 [[UTC]] / 1am PDT) and Sunday 23 March (1pm AEST / 0200 UTC / 7pm PDT Saturday 22 March) 2014.<ref name=\"SCG-MLD2014\">[http://www.sydneycricketground.com.au/latest-news/scgbaseball/ The SCG attracts $310 million of Major League Baseball talent] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112531/http://www.sydneycricketground.com.au/latest-news/scgbaseball/ |date=24 September 2015 }}, Sydney Cricket Ground, 13 June 2013, accessed 17 June 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/scg-to-host-la-dodgers-and-arizona-diamondbacks/story-e6frg7mf-1226663056565 SCG to host LA Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks], [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]&ndash;[[The Australian]], 13 June 2013, accessed 17 June 2013</ref><ref name=\"2014_MLB_opener\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130612&content_id=50446004&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb Dodgers, D-backs to open 2014 season in Australia \u2013 Two-game series in Sydney first regular-season games to be played in that country], [[Major League Baseball]], 12 June 2013, accessed 17 June 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasordaslair.com/2012/10/24/the-dodgers-down-under/ |title=The Dodgers Down Under? |website=lasordaslair.com |last=Wheeler |first=Stacie |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref>\n \nThe Northern Stand was completed for the [[2013\u201314 Ashes series]], and provided the main stand behind [[home plate]], with premium seating.

They\u2019ve been too reliant on funding from the NRL and haven\u2019t been measurable enough\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/exclusive-north-sydney-bears-set-to-awake-from-nrl-hibernation/news-story/e8529e80eb9129a71d6153c921900f13/|title=Exclusive: North Sydney Bears set to wake from NRL hibernation|website=Fox Sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/central-coast/unnamed-businessman-set-to-bankroll-bears-bid-to-enter-nrl/news-story/fd952c864ac51d25c8435c36d858d395/|title=Unnamed businessman set to bankroll Bears bid to enter NRL|website=Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-29/nrl-expansion-off-agenda-until-end-of-2014/4339320/|title=NRL benches expansion talk until end of 2014|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 August 2019, [[rugby league]] immortal [[Andrew Johns]] said that having a team on the Central Coast would be a \"no-brainer\".  Johns went on to say \u201cI think it\u2019s a must, We keep talking about Perth, but it\u2019s so far away I imagine the costs would be astronomical getting everyone over there and back.  At the Central Coast they have a stadium up there and they have a huge junior base.

Singleton said \u201cWe had the players and the lifestyle on the Central Coast once you get people up there they go: \u2018wow, how good\u2019s this\u2019. I can live on the beach\".  Singleton then spoke about the [[Gold Coast Titans]] and how their bid beat Singleton's initial bid for a Central Coast team in 2006 saying \u201cThey had no money and no stadium, and we did have a stadium built for North Sydney. And was a year late, that\u2019s all. And we had a $50 million bank guarantee, so we would have been strong.  It made sense to relocate one of the Sydney teams to the Central Coast\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/john-singleton-believes-central-coast-still-prepared-to-accommodate-a-relocated-nrl-club/1s6fyulb4i53h1gdd2neba4tfi/|title=John Singleton believes Central Coast still prepared to accommodate a relocated NRL club|website=Sporting News}}</ref>\n\n==North Sydney Leagues Club==\nRebranded as ''Norths,'' the North Sydney Leagues Club was established by the district's football club, the North Sydney Bears, in 1955 in a house in the Sydney suburb of [[Neutral Bay, New South Wales|Neutral Bay]]. In 1964, the club moved to new premises, its current location, in Abbott Street, [[Cammeray, New South Wales|Cammeray]].\n\nIn the fifty years the new building has stood, a number of redesigns and refurbishments have taken place. In 2014 facilities comprised two dining areas, function rooms, a 530-seat auditorium, a fitness and wellness centre, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, a bottle shop, a [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]], two squash courts, a courtesy bus service, a members rewards program and a multi-level car park for 320 vehicles.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Membership in 2016 stood at 21,500.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn 1996, Norths merged with the North Sydney Bowling Club, which was established in 1888 and is the second oldest club (by one day) in Australia. This Bowling Club was transformed and re-branded as The Greens North Sydney in November 2014. Norths also amalgamated with the [[Tweed Heads Seagulls|Seagulls]], a border club at [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]] on the far north coast of New South Wales, the oldest provincial rugby league club in Australia.<ref>[http://www.norths.com.au/about-us/history/ norths History | www.norths.com.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604025859/http://www.norths.com.au/about-us/history/ |date=4 June 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:Darren Nicholls.jpg|right|thumb|Darren Nicholls playing for the North Sydney Bears in the New South Wales Cup]]\n\n==2020 squad==\n{{Rls\n|squadname=2020 North Sydney Bears Squad\n|BC1=black;

Like the other Sydney district clubs, Norths were largely born from players and officials from the local [[Rugby Union]] club, [[Northern Suburbs Rugby Club]].

At the Central Coast they have a stadium up there and they have a huge junior base.

Singleton said \u201cWe had the players and the lifestyle on the Central Coast once you get people up there they go: \u2018wow, how good\u2019s this\u2019. I can live on the beach\".  Singleton then spoke about the [[Gold Coast Titans]] and how their bid beat Singleton's initial bid for a Central Coast team in 2006 saying \u201cThey had no money and no stadium, and we did have a stadium built for North Sydney. And was a year late, that\u2019s all. And we had a $50 million bank guarantee, so we would have been strong.  It made sense to relocate one of the Sydney teams to the Central Coast\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/john-singleton-believes-central-coast-still-prepared-to-accommodate-a-relocated-nrl-club/1s6fyulb4i53h1gdd2neba4tfi/|title=John Singleton believes Central Coast still prepared to accommodate a relocated NRL club|website=Sporting News}}</ref>\n\n==North Sydney Leagues Club==\nRebranded as ''Norths,'' the North Sydney Leagues Club was established by the district's football club, the North Sydney Bears, in 1955 in a house in the Sydney suburb of [[Neutral Bay, New South Wales|Neutral Bay]]. In 1964, the club moved to new premises, its current location, in Abbott Street, [[Cammeray, New South Wales|Cammeray]].\n\nIn the fifty years the new building has stood, a number of redesigns and refurbishments have taken place. In 2014 facilities comprised two dining areas, function rooms, a 530-seat auditorium, a fitness and wellness centre, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, a bottle shop, a [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]], two squash courts, a courtesy bus service, a members rewards program and a multi-level car park for 320 vehicles.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Membership in 2016 stood at 21,500.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn 1996, Norths merged with the North Sydney Bowling Club, which was established in 1888 and is the second oldest club (by one day) in Australia. This Bowling Club was transformed and re-branded as The Greens North Sydney in November 2014. Norths also amalgamated with the [[Tweed Heads Seagulls|Seagulls]], a border club at [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]] on the far north coast of New South Wales, the oldest provincial rugby league club in Australia.<ref>[http://www.norths.com.au/about-us/history/ norths History | www.norths.com.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604025859/http://www.norths.com.au/about-us/history/ |date=4 June 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:Darren Nicholls.jpg|right|thumb|Darren Nicholls playing for the North Sydney Bears in the New South Wales Cup]]\n\n==2020 squad==\n{{Rls\n|squadname=2020 North Sydney Bears Squad\n|BC1=black;

The penalty did not have an effect on the players, who remained eligible for Test and State of Origin selection as well as Dally M contention; ultimately, Melbourne did not figure prominently in the latter awards.\n\nThe [[Melbourne Storm season 2011|Storm's 2011 season]] saw a return to the top of the NRL ladder, winning what after the salary cap penalties was considered the club's first Minor Premiership. The season included a club record twelve consecutive wins. However, Melbourne did not reach the Grand Final, losing the preliminary final against [[New Zealand Warriors|New Zealand]]. [[Billy Slater]] won the Dally M Medal, and Craig Bellamy and Cameron Smith also won awards on Dally M Medal night.\n\nThe [[Melbourne Storm season 2012|Storm's 2012 season]] started very strongly with nine consecutive wins, the club's best start to a season up to that time. A five-game losing streak between Rounds 16 and 21 (the club's second worst losing streak to that time) saw them fall from the top of the ladder. However, from Round 22 forward they recovered their winning form and finished the regular season with five straight wins, ending the regular season in second place on the table. Storm began their finals campaign with a 24\u20136 win over [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]. Storm played its fifth Preliminary Final in six years, this time defeating [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] 40\u201312 at [[AAMI Park]]. Following this they went on to claim their second official Premiership defeating the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] 14 \u2013 4 in the [[2012 NRL Grand Final|Grand Final]].\n\nThe Storm began its [[2013 Melbourne Storm season|2013 season]] when they defeated [[Leeds Rhinos]] 18\u201314 in the [[2013 World Club Challenge|World Club Challenge]], to be crowned World Champions for 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Storm become World Champions |url=http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news-display/Storm-become-World-Club-Champions/68802 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130405115106/http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news-display/Storm-become-World-Club-Champions/68802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2013 |work=Melbourne Storm |date=23 February 2013 }}</ref> In round 5, they won their 5th consecutive game for the season and their 13th consecutive overall.  Setting a new club record, the streak ended at 15 games with a loss in Round 8. On 21 May 2013 the Storm announced that, News Limited had sold the club to Holding M.S. Australia Pty Limited, an organisation made up of internationally experienced and successful businessmen. This change included replacement of the News Ltd Board and Executive, which included the replacement of Chairman Stephen Rue with Bart Campbell and CEO Ron Gauci with Mark Evans.

In Round 5 they scored their 300th NRL win and in Round 9, Craig Bellamy coached his 350th NRL game. On 23 May the Melbourne Storm announced that it had been one of three successful bidders and the only NRL club to gain a licence to field a [[Netball]] side in a new expanded Australian Netball League to commence in 2017. The Storm were nominated by Netball Australia as a preferred bidder for one of three new team licences under their expansion plans. \"Melbourne Storm have partnered with the University of the Sunshine Coast for this project and we're both very proud and excited to have reached the preferred bidder stage for a licence in the new [[National Netball League]],\" Smith said at the announcement press conference on Thursday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2016/05/19/_we_re_very_excited_.af_news.html|title=We're very excited|last=NRL|website=NRL CLUBS|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> On 17 August 2016 it was announced that the new team will be called [[Sunshine Coast Lightning]]<ref name=\"auto\"/> and be based on the Sunshine Coast at the Storm sports Academy and in effect be a second Queensland Team. The announcement is to establish the Storm as not just a Rugby League club but a sporting and community club. At the conclusion of the 2016 NRL season the Melbourne Storm finished in first place claiming their second legitimate Minor Premiership. They qualified for the NRL Finals series winning their first two finals and thus making it through to the [[2016 NRL Grand Final]] against the [[Cronulla Sharks]]. The game was a very hard-fought match, as the game hung in the balance until the dying second but the Sharks hung on to win.\n\n2017 was another successful year for the Melbourne Storm, the club's 20th season in the NRL. Following on from the heartbreak of losing the Grand final in 2016, the club went from strength to strength recruiting well in the off season and dominated the 2017 NRL season to finish in first place earning them their third legitimate minor premiership. The Storm won 20 and lost 4 games throughout the season making it their most dominant season in 10 years. Cameron Smith also broke a number of league, club and personal records throughout the 2017 season including the NRL games record for the most games played, league record for the most wins as a captain, a personal best for the most points in a game and also scored his 2000th career point and 1000th career goal, the first time any player has achieved this. The Storm continued their success into the 2017 NRL finals and won their first two, a home Qualifying final against the Parramatta Eels 18\u201316 and a home Preliminary Final against Brisbane Broncos 30\u20130 to qualify them for their second consecutive Grand Final. The [[2017 NRL Grand Final]] was played against the North Queensland Cowboys, which Melbourne Storm dominated to earn them their 3rd official Premiership 34 \u2013 6. Billy Slater won his second Clive Churchill medal.

In 2018 the club is also celebrating its 20th anniversary and on 2 March announced their team of the first 20 years during a gala evening at Crown Casino.

In the qualifying final the Storm were narrowly defeated by the Canberra Raiders at home 10-12 and were then forced into a semi final against the Parramatta Eels at home, beating the Eels 32\u20130.

The club officials were all set to go with this until News Limited's [[Lachlan Murdoch]] told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne Storm |url=http://www.convictcreations.com/football/melbournestorm.htm#.UYMwdB5-_VR  | work=Convict Creations | date=1 May 2013}}</ref> Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However, co-CEOs [[Chris Johns (rugby league)|Chris Johns]] and [[John Ribot]] decided to go with the themes of lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.<ref name=\"page344\"/>\n\n[[File:Melbourne Storm logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Melbourne Storm original logo from 1997 - 2017]]\n\nThe Storm was always going to go with the colours of their state, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (navy blue with a white 'V'), but club consultant at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive.<ref name=\"page344\"/> These colours appear in the logo; however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010\u20132012, gold returned, silver was omitted and purple became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey. Gold disappeared along with most of the white, and the lightning bolts were changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again, for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the jersey, navy blue and purple always remain the main colours.\n\nBetween 1998\u20132001, Melbourne was the only club to display player names on the back of jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time. It also helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco,<ref>{{cite news|title=Addecco joins Storm in 4 million dollar deal |url=http://rleague.com/news/Adecco-joins-Storm-force-in-4mil-deal_116551/  | work=rleague.com | date=1 May 2000}}</ref> which was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players' names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the players' names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the jersey.\n\nIn October 2017, the club began celebrations of its 20th Anniversary,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2017/10/30/storm_launch_20_year_1617972549.html|title=Storm launch 20 year celebrations|work=Melbournestorm.com.au|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> with the announcement that a new logo would feature for the duration of the 20 year celebrations. The logo was a shield based logo with the storm man featured above the words \"Melbourne Storm 20 Years\".\n\nOn 17 October 2018, the club replaced the 20th Anniversary logo with a new permanent logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2018/10/17/new-look-storm/|title=New look Storm|work=Melbournestorm.com.au|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> The new permanent Logo is a derivation of the 20 year logo featuring no shield and a more bold \"Melbourne Storm\" and has also dropped the colour Yellow from the logo however it still exists on the collar of the uniform.\n\n==Club song==\nThe Melbourne Storm's club song, written by Jon Mol and Phil Wall, is called \"We Are the Storm\".<ref>{{cite news|title=We are the Storm |url=http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/club-song  | work=Melbourne Storm | date=1 May 2013}}</ref> The song played over the public address system following each home victory.\nWhen the team enter the stadium, the [[AC/DC]] song \"[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]\" is played.\n\n==Rivalries==\n'''St. George Illawarra Dragons'''\n\nThe Dragons \u2013 Storm rivalry was at its highest in the years following the [[1999 NRL Grand Final]]. In this game the Storm narrowly beat the Dragons, with a late penalty try putting the Storm in front. The following year, [[Anthony Mundine]] declared that the Storm were not \"worthy premiers\" in the run up to their round 5 rematch. The Storm responded by belting the Dragons 70\u201310. However, later that season, the Dragons had a large win defeating the Storm 50\u20134. In 2006, the Storm and Dragons once again met in a Preliminary Final which the Storm won. On 21 July 2008, the Storm won at Olympic Park 26\u20130, in a match highlighted by several ugly brawls.<ref>{{cite news|title=Haunted Dragons facing Storm graveyard  |url=http://illawarra.yourguide.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/haunted-dragons-facing-storm-graveyard/844398.aspx  | work=Illawarra Mercury | date=17 July 2008}}</ref> In 2009, the Storm defeated the Dragons in Round 1 17\u201316 with a field goal in Golden Point extra time. Since then the rivalry has subsided somewhat and is no longer as strong as it once was.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n'''Brisbane Broncos'''<br/>\nThe Melbourne Storm has a strong rivalry with Brisbane, built in large part on the large number of finals games played between the teams, including one final in each year from 2004 to 2009, with the Storm winning all but one of them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of [[Queensland State of Origin team|Queensland Origin]] players across their squads in the better part of the past decade.\n\n{{Quotation|\"When Bellamy left here and went to Melbourne, the rivalry with them went up a notch then... their record is good against us.\"|[[Darren Lockyer]], 26 September 2009<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\">{{cite news|title=Enemy No.1 in Melbourne Storm sights  |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/enemy-no1-in-melbourne-storm-sights/story-e6frf9if-1225779696931  | work=Herald Sun | date=26 September 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nEvery year since Brisbane's victory over Melbourne in the 2006 Grand Final, Melbourne have ended the Broncos' season by knocking them out of the finals. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith commented on the rivalry prior to their 2009 Preliminary Final at Etihad Stadium.\n\n{{Quotation|\"A lot of people talk about us and Manly, but I think all the boys for whatever reason would say we take more satisfaction out of beating the Broncos...we love playing them...there is always plenty of feeling and intensity in the games...it probably wouldn't feel like September if we weren't playing them at some stage.\"|[[Cameron Smith]], 26 September 2009<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\"/>}}\n\nThe Brisbane Broncos defeated the Storm 15\u20138 in the 2006 NRL Grand Final. The Storm sought revenge through a 40\u20130 thrashing in the 2007 Qualifying Final at [[Olympic Park Stadium]]. The 2008 Semi-Final at [[Suncorp Stadium]] ended with Melbourne dramatically winning 16\u201314 with a try on the final play of the game. In 2009 Brisbane were again beaten by eventual premiers Melbourne, this time 40\u201310 at Etihad Stadium, catapulting the Storm to their 4th consecutive Grand Final Appearance.\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles'''<br/>\n{{see also|Manly\u2013Melbourne NRL rivalry}}{{see also|Battle of Brookvale}}\nThe Storm defeated Manly 34\u20138 in the 2007 Grand Final but lost to{{clarify|date=September 2018}} in the 2008 re-match in a 0\u201340 loss.

Prior to this the club played the vast majority of their home matches at the city's now demolished [[Olympic Park Stadium]], which was located next door. Affectionately coined \"The Graveyard\" by fans due to the incredible 77.2% winning percentage there, it was there that the club played their inaugural home match in the fourth round of the 1998 season on 3 April 1998, having come off the back of three successive away victories.<ref name=\"page346\"/> The team recorded a 26\u201316 victory over the [[North Sydney Bears]], and the crowd of 20,522 was the largest attendance for the club at [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]].<ref name=\"crowds\">{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/rl/crowds/2016.html|title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Melbourne|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was also at this time that Melbourne Storm helped set a Rugby League World record attendance figure of 107,999. This was during the [[1999 NRL Grand final]], held at [[Stadium Australia]] where they defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons, to win their first NRL premiership. As the ground's capacity has since been reduced this record cannot be broken.\n\n[[File:Mbnolypkst.jpg|220px|thumb|The Storm's former home ground, [[Olympic Park Stadium]] during a Toyota cup match]]\nThe team remained at Olympic Park until the end of the 2000 season, when it was decided that due to attracting larger home crowds which were now averaging 14,622 spectators,<ref name=\"crowds\"/> they decided to relocate to the much larger capacity [[Docklands Stadium]] for the following season. However, due to Docklands stadium being primarily suited to AFL games and in addition the AFL and stadium management being reluctant to reconfigure the seating for Rugby League games and coupled with the team missing the finals that year, crowd numbers declined and it was decided to move the team back to Olympic Park. Docklands stadium was still used by the Storm for home finals until 2010 and this allowed a home final attendance record of 33,427 to be set in 2007 in the Preliminary Final against [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].\n\nFrom 2002, crowd numbers declined and by 2004 the Storm had their lowest crowd average of 8,886 per home game; however, at this time the Storm also began a strong recruiting drive and with a new and exciting playing roster, crowds steadily rose over the following years, returning to an average of 14,670 by 2010.  The Storm played their final game at Olympic Park in round 25 of the 2009 season, 29 August 2009, with a 36\u20134 thrashing of the [[Sydney Roosters]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Countdown to final Olympic Park game |url=http://rleague.com/news/Countdown-to-final-Olympic-Park-game_87385/  | work=Rleague.com | date=25 August 2009}}</ref> The intention was to relocate to its new home venue next door at AAMI Park; however, delays in construction meant that the first game could not be played at the venue until Round 9 of the 2010 season, therefore, the first three home games of 2010 were played at Etihad Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Welcome to AAMI Park |url=http://www.colliepl.com/news_and_projects/2010/06/welcome-to-aami-park/  | work=collie | date=28 June 2010}}</ref>  Since then all Storm home games (with the exception of a few homes games played interstate), regular season and finals, have been played at AAMI Park.\n\nFollowing winning the 2012 premiership and having sustained onfield success, crowd numbers continued to rise. The club's highest regular season attendance at AAMI Park, of 28,716, was set on 25 April 2014 for the [[ANZAC Day]] match against [[New Zealand Warriors]]. The average crowds have continued to increase and by the end of the 2016 season had reached a peak of 18,079.<ref name=\"crowds\"/> The 2016 season also included their highest official \"home\" attendance of 52,347 set during a doubleheader game at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.<ref name=\"crowds\"/>\n\n==Statistics and records==\n{{details|List of Melbourne Storm records}}\nAs of the end of the [[2019 NRL season]], the Storm have won three legitimate NRL Premierships (1999, 2012, 2017) and four Minor Premierships (2011, 2016, 2017, 2019). Their current wins percentage of 65.74% is the best in the league. The most capped player is [[Cameron Smith]] with 411 NRL appearances thus far. Smiths total is currently a league record and he also is currently the only NRL player in history to reach the 400 game mark. In addition, Smith is also the leagues highest point scorer with 2602 career points. Fullback [[Billy Slater]] is the club's most prolific try scorer with 190 tries scored during his career. Melbourne Storm players have also won the [[Dally M]] medal on five occasions: [[Cameron Smith]] twice in 2006 and most recently in 2017, Billy Slater in 2011 and [[Cooper Cronk]] twice in 2013 and 2016. The Storm have thus far had five [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award|Golden Boot award]] winners, more than any other club (Smith 2007 and 2017, Slater 2008, [[Greg Inglis]] 2009 and Cronk in 2016).\n\nMelbourne Storm's current winning streak record for the most consecutive matches won stands at 15 matches, completed between Round 22 of the 2012 NRL season and Round 7 of the 2013 NRL season; this included winning the 2012 NRL Premiership.

The relationship would prove to be a fruitful one as 13 of the 17 players to compete for the Storm in the [[2006 NRL Grand Final]] had played for the Devils in previous years. In 2005, the Storm also established an affiliation with the [[North Sydney Bears]] in the [[New South Wales Cup]]. Melbourne severed ties with both the Bears and the Devils in 2007 and aligned themselves with the [[Central Coast Centurions|Central Coast Storm]] in the New South Wales Cup. The affiliation lasted three seasons before the Storm decided to establish their own team in the NSW Cup  in 2010 which would share its namesake. An unsuccessful venture saw the Storm revert to the Queensland Cup in 2011 when it established a feeder relationship with the [[Eastern Suburbs Tigers|Easts Tigers]].

This change included replacement of the News Ltd Board and Executive, which included the replacement of Chairman Stephen Rue with Bart Campbell and CEO Ron Gauci with Mark Evans.

In August 2015 the storm announced that they would create an Academy on the Sunshine Coast to develop and nurture developing talent in the region with a view to progressing through the Storm ranks. Part of the establishment of this Academy meant that the Melbourne Storm Under 20s Team would play all of its home games at the new facility from 2016 onward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-28/storm-announce-academy-on-sunshine-coast/6732496|title=Storm announce academy on Sunshine Coast|date=2015-08-28|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\nThe 2016 season began well for the Storm finding themselves in third place on the ladder after 10 rounds. In Round 5 they scored their 300th NRL win and in Round 9, Craig Bellamy coached his 350th NRL game. On 23 May the Melbourne Storm announced that it had been one of three successful bidders and the only NRL club to gain a licence to field a [[Netball]] side in a new expanded Australian Netball League to commence in 2017. The Storm were nominated by Netball Australia as a preferred bidder for one of three new team licences under their expansion plans. \"Melbourne Storm have partnered with the University of the Sunshine Coast for this project and we're both very proud and excited to have reached the preferred bidder stage for a licence in the new [[National Netball League]],\" Smith said at the announcement press conference on Thursday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2016/05/19/_we_re_very_excited_.af_news.html|title=We're very excited|last=NRL|website=NRL CLUBS|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> On 17 August 2016 it was announced that the new team will be called [[Sunshine Coast Lightning]]<ref name=\"auto\"/> and be based on the Sunshine Coast at the Storm sports Academy and in effect be a second Queensland Team. The announcement is to establish the Storm as not just a Rugby League club but a sporting and community club. At the conclusion of the 2016 NRL season the Melbourne Storm finished in first place claiming their second legitimate Minor Premiership. They qualified for the NRL Finals series winning their first two finals and thus making it through to the [[2016 NRL Grand Final]] against the [[Cronulla Sharks]]. The game was a very hard-fought match, as the game hung in the balance until the dying second but the Sharks hung on to win.\n\n2017 was another successful year for the Melbourne Storm, the club's 20th season in the NRL. Following on from the heartbreak of losing the Grand final in 2016, the club went from strength to strength recruiting well in the off season and dominated the 2017 NRL season to finish in first place earning them their third legitimate minor premiership. The Storm won 20 and lost 4 games throughout the season making it their most dominant season in 10 years. Cameron Smith also broke a number of league, club and personal records throughout the 2017 season including the NRL games record for the most games played, league record for the most wins as a captain, a personal best for the most points in a game and also scored his 2000th career point and 1000th career goal, the first time any player has achieved this. The Storm continued their success into the 2017 NRL finals and won their first two, a home Qualifying final against the Parramatta Eels 18\u201316 and a home Preliminary Final against Brisbane Broncos 30\u20130 to qualify them for their second consecutive Grand Final. The [[2017 NRL Grand Final]] was played against the North Queensland Cowboys, which Melbourne Storm dominated to earn them their 3rd official Premiership 34 \u2013 6. Billy Slater won his second Clive Churchill medal. In December 2017, the NRL announced the formation of a women's competition with Melbourne Storm expressing their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural [[NRL Women's]] season.<ref name=\"storm-womens-interest\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/swoop/melbourne-storm-pushing-for-team-in-new-womens-competition/news-story/3e7a1ef917d47a94240cd842bcaa1e14|title=Melbourne Storm pushing for team in new women's competition|newspaper=Herald Sun|first=Chris|last=Cavanagh|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n2018 began in successful fashion for the club when on Friday 16 February the Storm beat the Leeds Rhinos to win the [[2018 World Club Challenge]] 38\u20134. In 2018 the club is also celebrating its 20th anniversary and on 2 March announced their team of the first 20 years during a gala evening at Crown Casino. The 17-man line-up is made up of the greatest players to have pulled on the purple jersey over the last two decades.<ref name=\"Storm announce 20 Year Team\">{{cite web|url=https://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2018/03/02/storm-announce-20-year-team/|title=Storm announce 20 Year Team|work=nrl.com.au|accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2019 season saw the Storm win the minor premiership, finishing six points ahead of the Sydney Roosters. In the qualifying final the Storm were narrowly defeated by the Canberra Raiders at home 10-12 and were then forced into a semi final against the Parramatta Eels at home, beating the Eels 32\u20130. This meant the Storm qualified for the Preliminary final where the season would come to an end, losing the game 14\u20136 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.<ref name=\"Storm stats 2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/12/20/100-1-the-stats-that-defined-the-2019-nrl-season//|title=100-1: the numbers that defined the 2019 season|work=nrl.com.au|accessdate=19 Dec 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Emblem and colours==\nOriginally, the club favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding a fistful of dollars. The club officials were all set to go with this until News Limited's [[Lachlan Murdoch]] told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne Storm |url=http://www.convictcreations.com/football/melbournestorm.htm#.UYMwdB5-_VR  | work=Convict Creations | date=1 May 2013}}</ref> Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However, co-CEOs [[Chris Johns (rugby league)|Chris Johns]] and [[John Ribot]] decided to go with the themes of lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.<ref name=\"page344\"/>\n\n[[File:Melbourne Storm logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Melbourne Storm original logo from 1997 - 2017]]\n\nThe Storm was always going to go with the colours of their state, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (navy blue with a white 'V'), but club consultant at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive.<ref name=\"page344\"/> These colours appear in the logo; however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010\u20132012, gold returned, silver was omitted and purple became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey. Gold disappeared along with most of the white, and the lightning bolts were changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again, for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the jersey, navy blue and purple always remain the main colours.\n\nBetween 1998\u20132001, Melbourne was the only club to display player names on the back of jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time. It also helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco,<ref>{{cite news|title=Addecco joins Storm in 4 million dollar deal |url=http://rleague.com/news/Adecco-joins-Storm-force-in-4mil-deal_116551/  | work=rleague.com | date=1 May 2000}}</ref> which was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players' names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the players' names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the jersey.\n\nIn October 2017, the club began celebrations of its 20th Anniversary,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2017/10/30/storm_launch_20_year_1617972549.html|title=Storm launch 20 year celebrations|work=Melbournestorm.com.au|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> with the announcement that a new logo would feature for the duration of the 20 year celebrations. The logo was a shield based logo with the storm man featured above the words \"Melbourne Storm 20 Years\".\n\nOn 17 October 2018, the club replaced the 20th Anniversary logo with a new permanent logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2018/10/17/new-look-storm/|title=New look Storm|work=Melbournestorm.com.au|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> The new permanent Logo is a derivation of the 20 year logo featuring no shield and a more bold \"Melbourne Storm\" and has also dropped the colour Yellow from the logo however it still exists on the collar of the uniform.\n\n==Club song==\nThe Melbourne Storm's club song, written by Jon Mol and Phil Wall, is called \"We Are the Storm\".<ref>{{cite news|title=We are the Storm |url=http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/club-song  | work=Melbourne Storm | date=1 May 2013}}</ref> The song played over the public address system following each home victory.\nWhen the team enter the stadium, the [[AC/DC]] song \"[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]\" is played.\n\n==Rivalries==\n'''St. George Illawarra Dragons'''\n\nThe Dragons \u2013 Storm rivalry was at its highest in the years following the [[1999 NRL Grand Final]]. In this game the Storm narrowly beat the Dragons, with a late penalty try putting the Storm in front. The following year, [[Anthony Mundine]] declared that the Storm were not \"worthy premiers\" in the run up to their round 5 rematch. The Storm responded by belting the Dragons 70\u201310. However, later that season, the Dragons had a large win defeating the Storm 50\u20134. In 2006, the Storm and Dragons once again met in a Preliminary Final which the Storm won. On 21 July 2008, the Storm won at Olympic Park 26\u20130, in a match highlighted by several ugly brawls.<ref>{{cite news|title=Haunted Dragons facing Storm graveyard  |url=http://illawarra.yourguide.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/haunted-dragons-facing-storm-graveyard/844398.aspx  | work=Illawarra Mercury | date=17 July 2008}}</ref> In 2009, the Storm defeated the Dragons in Round 1 17\u201316 with a field goal in Golden Point extra time. Since then the rivalry has subsided somewhat and is no longer as strong as it once was.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n'''Brisbane Broncos'''<br/>\nThe Melbourne Storm has a strong rivalry with Brisbane, built in large part on the large number of finals games played between the teams, including one final in each year from 2004 to 2009, with the Storm winning all but one of them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of [[Queensland State of Origin team|Queensland Origin]] players across their squads in the better part of the past decade.\n\n{{Quotation|\"When Bellamy left here and went to Melbourne, the rivalry with them went up a notch then... their record is good against us.\"|[[Darren Lockyer]], 26 September 2009<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\">{{cite news|title=Enemy No.1 in Melbourne Storm sights  |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/enemy-no1-in-melbourne-storm-sights/story-e6frf9if-1225779696931  | work=Herald Sun | date=26 September 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nEvery year since Brisbane's victory over Melbourne in the 2006 Grand Final, Melbourne have ended the Broncos' season by knocking them out of the finals. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith commented on the rivalry prior to their 2009 Preliminary Final at Etihad Stadium.\n\n{{Quotation|\"A lot of people talk about us and Manly, but I think all the boys for whatever reason would say we take more satisfaction out of beating the Broncos...we love playing them...there is always plenty of feeling and intensity in the games...it probably wouldn't feel like September if we weren't playing them at some stage.\"|[[Cameron Smith]], 26 September 2009<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\"/>}}\n\nThe Brisbane Broncos defeated the Storm 15\u20138 in the 2006 NRL Grand Final. The Storm sought revenge through a 40\u20130 thrashing in the 2007 Qualifying Final at [[Olympic Park Stadium]]. The 2008 Semi-Final at [[Suncorp Stadium]] ended with Melbourne dramatically winning 16\u201314 with a try on the final play of the game. In 2009 Brisbane were again beaten by eventual premiers Melbourne, this time 40\u201310 at Etihad Stadium, catapulting the Storm to their 4th consecutive Grand Final Appearance.\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles'''<br/>\n{{see also|Manly\u2013Melbourne NRL rivalry}}{{see also|Battle of Brookvale}}\nThe Storm defeated Manly 34\u20138 in the 2007 Grand Final but lost to{{clarify|date=September 2018}} in the 2008 re-match in a 0\u201340 loss. To add to the rivalry, Melbourne beat Manly 40\u201312 in the opening final of the 2009 finals series, ending their bid to be back-to-back premiers. In September 21, 2012, Storm and Manly played each other in the preliminary final for the first time.

Both teams play for the Michael Moore Trophy.\n\n==Stadium and attendances==\n[[File:Backofamipark.JPG|220px|thumb|Inside the Storm's home ground, [[AAMI Park]]]]\nMelbourne's current home ground is [[AAMI Park]] and has been since the 2010 season. Prior to this the club played the vast majority of their home matches at the city's now demolished [[Olympic Park Stadium]], which was located next door. Affectionately coined \"The Graveyard\" by fans due to the incredible 77.2% winning percentage there, it was there that the club played their inaugural home match in the fourth round of the 1998 season on 3 April 1998, having come off the back of three successive away victories.<ref name=\"page346\"/> The team recorded a 26\u201316 victory over the [[North Sydney Bears]], and the crowd of 20,522 was the largest attendance for the club at [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]].<ref name=\"crowds\">{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/rl/crowds/2016.html|title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Melbourne|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was also at this time that Melbourne Storm helped set a Rugby League World record attendance figure of 107,999. This was during the [[1999 NRL Grand final]], held at [[Stadium Australia]] where they defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons, to win their first NRL premiership. As the ground's capacity has since been reduced this record cannot be broken.\n\n[[File:Mbnolypkst.jpg|220px|thumb|The Storm's former home ground, [[Olympic Park Stadium]] during a Toyota cup match]]\nThe team remained at Olympic Park until the end of the 2000 season, when it was decided that due to attracting larger home crowds which were now averaging 14,622 spectators,<ref name=\"crowds\"/> they decided to relocate to the much larger capacity [[Docklands Stadium]] for the following season. However, due to Docklands stadium being primarily suited to AFL games and in addition the AFL and stadium management being reluctant to reconfigure the seating for Rugby League games and coupled with the team missing the finals that year, crowd numbers declined and it was decided to move the team back to Olympic Park. Docklands stadium was still used by the Storm for home finals until 2010 and this allowed a home final attendance record of 33,427 to be set in 2007 in the Preliminary Final against [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].\n\nFrom 2002, crowd numbers declined and by 2004 the Storm had their lowest crowd average of 8,886 per home game; however, at this time the Storm also began a strong recruiting drive and with a new and exciting playing roster, crowds steadily rose over the following years, returning to an average of 14,670 by 2010.  The Storm played their final game at Olympic Park in round 25 of the 2009 season, 29 August 2009, with a 36\u20134 thrashing of the [[Sydney Roosters]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Countdown to final Olympic Park game |url=http://rleague.com/news/Countdown-to-final-Olympic-Park-game_87385/  | work=Rleague.com | date=25 August 2009}}</ref> The intention was to relocate to its new home venue next door at AAMI Park; however, delays in construction meant that the first game could not be played at the venue until Round 9 of the 2010 season, therefore, the first three home games of 2010 were played at Etihad Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Welcome to AAMI Park |url=http://www.colliepl.com/news_and_projects/2010/06/welcome-to-aami-park/  | work=collie | date=28 June 2010}}</ref>  Since then all Storm home games (with the exception of a few homes games played interstate), regular season and finals, have been played at AAMI Park.\n\nFollowing winning the 2012 premiership and having sustained onfield success, crowd numbers continued to rise. The club's highest regular season attendance at AAMI Park, of 28,716, was set on 25 April 2014 for the [[ANZAC Day]] match against [[New Zealand Warriors]]. The average crowds have continued to increase and by the end of the 2016 season had reached a peak of 18,079.<ref name=\"crowds\"/> The 2016 season also included their highest official \"home\" attendance of 52,347 set during a doubleheader game at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.<ref name=\"crowds\"/>\n\n==Statistics and records==\n{{details|List of Melbourne Storm records}}\nAs of the end of the [[2019 NRL season]], the Storm have won three legitimate NRL Premierships (1999, 2012, 2017) and four Minor Premierships (2011, 2016, 2017, 2019). Their current wins percentage of 65.74% is the best in the league. The most capped player is [[Cameron Smith]] with 411 NRL appearances thus far. Smiths total is currently a league record and he also is currently the only NRL player in history to reach the 400 game mark. In addition, Smith is also the leagues highest point scorer with 2602 career points. Fullback [[Billy Slater]] is the club's most prolific try scorer with 190 tries scored during his career. Melbourne Storm players have also won the [[Dally M]] medal on five occasions: [[Cameron Smith]] twice in 2006 and most recently in 2017, Billy Slater in 2011 and [[Cooper Cronk]] twice in 2013 and 2016. The Storm have thus far had five [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award|Golden Boot award]] winners, more than any other club (Smith 2007 and 2017, Slater 2008, [[Greg Inglis]] 2009 and Cronk in 2016).\n\nMelbourne Storm's current winning streak record for the most consecutive matches won stands at 15 matches, completed between Round 22 of the 2012 NRL season and Round 7 of the 2013 NRL season; this included winning the 2012 NRL Premiership. The club's all-time highest score is 70 points scored against St. George Illawarra on 3 March 2000 but the highest winning margin is 64 points achieved in a 64\u20130 win over West Tigers in 2001 and equaled in a 68\u20134 win over Canberra Raiders in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne Storm Statistics and Records |url=http://afltables.com/rl/teams/melbourne/melbourne_idx.html | work=rleague.com | date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Season summaries===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\"\n|+ P=Premier, R=Runner-Up, M=Minor Premier, F=Finals appearance, W=Wooden Spoon, S=Stripped of title <br/> (Brackets represent Finals games)\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

The affiliation lasted three seasons before the Storm decided to establish their own team in the NSW Cup  in 2010 which would share its namesake.

Sweat glands, piloerector muscles, and some blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic neurons.\n\n===Pathological sweating===\n\nDiaphoresis may be associated with some abnormal conditions, such as [[hyperthyroidism]] and shock. If it is accompanied by unexplained [[weight loss]] or [[fever]] or by [[palpitation]]s, [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or chest discomfort, it suggests serious illness.\n\nDiaphoresis is also seen in an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), from the increased firing of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], and is frequent in [[serotonin syndrome]]. Diaphoresis can also be caused by many types of infections, often accompanied by [[fever]] and/or [[chills]]. Most infections can cause some degree of diaphoresis and it is a very common symptom in some serious infections such as [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].  In addition, pneumothorax can cause diaphoresis with splinting of the chest wall.\n[[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] and other malignant diseases (e.g. leukemias) can also cause diaphoresis.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|816018|Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome|clinical}}</ref>\n\nDiabetics relying on [[insulin]] shots or oral medications may have low [[blood sugar]] ([[hypoglycemia]]), which can also cause diaphoresis.\n\nDrugs (including [[caffeine]], [[morphine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], antidepressants and certain antipsychotics) may be causes, as well as [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[nonbenzodiazepines]] or [[narcotic]] painkiller dependencies. [[Sympathetic nervous system]] stimulants such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]] have also been associated with diaphoresis. Diaphoresis due to ectopic [[catecholamine]] is a classic symptom of a [[pheochromocytoma]], a rare [[tumor]] of the [[adrenal gland]].

The person may or may not also perspire excessively while awake.\n\nOne of the most common causes of night sweats in women over 40 is the hormonal changes related to menopause and perimenopause. This is a very common occurrence during the menopausal transition years.\n\nWhile night sweats might be relatively harmless, it can also be a sign of a serious underlying disease. It is important to distinguish night sweats due to medical causes from those that occur simply because the sleep environment is too warm, either because the bedroom is unusually hot or because there are too many covers on the bed. Night sweats caused by a medical condition or infection can be described as \"severe hot flashes occurring at night that can drench sleepwear and sheets, which are not related to the environment\". Some of the underlying medical conditions and infections that cause these severe night sweats can be life-threatening and should promptly be investigated by a medical practitioner.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Sweaty runner.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man competing in the 2014 Carlsbad Triathlon jogs on a paved path along a beach in Southern California. His expression shows the labor of his effort.|The evaporation of sweat on the skin cools the body.]]\nSweating allows the body to regulate its temperature. Sweating is controlled from a center in the preoptic and anterior regions of the brain's [[hypothalamus]], where thermosensitive neurons are located. The heat-regulatory function of the hypothalamus is also affected by inputs from temperature receptors in the [[skin]]. High skin temperature reduces the hypothalamic set point for sweating and increases the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the hypothalamic [[feedback]] system in response to variations in core [[temperature]]. Overall, however, the sweating response to a rise in hypothalamic ('core') temperature is much larger than the response to the same increase in average skin temperature.\n\nSweating causes a decrease in core temperature through evaporative cooling at the skin surface. As high energy molecules evaporate from the skin, releasing energy absorbed from the body, the skin and superficial vessels decrease in temperature. Cooled venous blood then returns to the body's core and counteracts rising core temperatures.\n\nThere are two situations in which the nerves will stimulate the sweat glands, causing perspiration: during physical heat and during emotional stress. In general, emotionally induced sweating is restricted to [[Palm (hand)|palm]]s, [[Sole (foot)|sole]]s, [[armpit]]s, and sometimes the [[forehead]], while physical heat-induced sweating occurs throughout the body.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(97)00642-9 |first1=Tomoya |last1=Kameia |first2=Takao |last2=Tsudab |first3=Shinya |last3=Kitagawab |first4=Ken |last4=Naitoha |first5=Koji |last5=Nakashimaa |first6=Toshio |last6=Ohhashi |date=June 1998 |title=Physical stimuli and emotional stress-induced sweat secretions in the human palm and forehead |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=365 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=319\u2013326}}</ref>\n\nPeople have an average of two to four million sweat glands. But how much sweat is released by each gland is determined by many factors, including gender, genetics, environmental conditions, age or fitness level. Two of the major contributors to sweat rate are an individual's fitness level and weight. If an individual weighs more, sweat rate is likely to increase because the body must exert more energy to function and there is more body mass to cool down.  On the other hand, a fit person will start sweating earlier and more readily. As someone becomes fit, the body becomes more efficient at regulating the body's temperature and sweat glands adapt along with the body's other systems.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Julieann|title=The Science of Sweat|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/may/the-science-of-sweat|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055518/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/may/the-science-of-sweat|archive-date=2013-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSweat is not pure [[water]]; it always contains a small amount (0.2\u20131%) of [[Solution|solute]]. When a person moves from a [[cold]] [[climate]] to a [[Temperature|hot]] climate, adaptive changes occur in the sweating mechanisms of the person. This process is referred to as [[acclimatisation]]: the maximum rate of sweating increases and its solute composition decreases. The volume of water lost in sweat daily is highly variable, ranging from 100 to 8,000 mL/day. The solute loss can be as much as 350&nbsp;mmol/d (or 90&nbsp;mmol/d acclimatised) of [[sodium]] under the most extreme conditions. During average intensity exercise, sweat losses can average up to 2 litres of water/hour.  In a cool climate and in the absence of [[exercise]], sodium loss can be very low (less than 5 mmol/d). Sodium concentration in sweat is 30-65&nbsp;mmol/l, depending on the degree of acclimatisation.\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:TranspirationPerspirationCommonsFL.jpg|thumb|alt=Close-up of beads of sweat|Beads of sweat emerging from [[eccrine gland]]s]]\n\nSweat is mostly [[water]].

Some causes of diaphoresis include physical exertion, [[menopause]], fever, ingestion of toxins or irritants, and high environmental temperature. Strong emotions (anger, fear, anxiety) and recall of past trauma can also trigger sweating.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe vast majority of sweat glands in the body are innervated by [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[cholinergic]] neurons.<ref>Boron, Walter F., and Emile L.

Sweat glands, piloerector muscles, and some blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic neurons.\n\n===Pathological sweating===\n\nDiaphoresis may be associated with some abnormal conditions, such as [[hyperthyroidism]] and shock. If it is accompanied by unexplained [[weight loss]] or [[fever]] or by [[palpitation]]s, [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or chest discomfort, it suggests serious illness.\n\nDiaphoresis is also seen in an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), from the increased firing of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], and is frequent in [[serotonin syndrome]]. Diaphoresis can also be caused by many types of infections, often accompanied by [[fever]] and/or [[chills]]. Most infections can cause some degree of diaphoresis and it is a very common symptom in some serious infections such as [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].  In addition, pneumothorax can cause diaphoresis with splinting of the chest wall.\n[[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] and other malignant diseases (e.g. leukemias) can also cause diaphoresis.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|816018|Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome|clinical}}</ref>\n\nDiabetics relying on [[insulin]] shots or oral medications may have low [[blood sugar]] ([[hypoglycemia]]), which can also cause diaphoresis.\n\nDrugs (including [[caffeine]], [[morphine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], antidepressants and certain antipsychotics) may be causes, as well as [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[nonbenzodiazepines]] or [[narcotic]] painkiller dependencies. [[Sympathetic nervous system]] stimulants such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]] have also been associated with diaphoresis. Diaphoresis due to ectopic [[catecholamine]] is a classic symptom of a [[pheochromocytoma]], a rare [[tumor]] of the [[adrenal gland]]. [[Acetylcholinesterase]] inhibitors (e.g. some [[insecticides]]) also cause contraction of sweat gland smooth muscle leading to diaphoresis.\n[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is well known for its use as a diaphoretic, and was widely used in the 19th and early 20th century by physicians to \"purge\" the body of an illness.

The person may or may not also perspire excessively while awake.\n\nOne of the most common causes of night sweats in women over 40 is the hormonal changes related to menopause and perimenopause. This is a very common occurrence during the menopausal transition years.\n\nWhile night sweats might be relatively harmless, it can also be a sign of a serious underlying disease. It is important to distinguish night sweats due to medical causes from those that occur simply because the sleep environment is too warm, either because the bedroom is unusually hot or because there are too many covers on the bed. Night sweats caused by a medical condition or infection can be described as \"severe hot flashes occurring at night that can drench sleepwear and sheets, which are not related to the environment\". Some of the underlying medical conditions and infections that cause these severe night sweats can be life-threatening and should promptly be investigated by a medical practitioner.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Sweaty runner.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man competing in the 2014 Carlsbad Triathlon jogs on a paved path along a beach in Southern California. His expression shows the labor of his effort.|The evaporation of sweat on the skin cools the body.]]\nSweating allows the body to regulate its temperature. Sweating is controlled from a center in the preoptic and anterior regions of the brain's [[hypothalamus]], where thermosensitive neurons are located. The heat-regulatory function of the hypothalamus is also affected by inputs from temperature receptors in the [[skin]]. High skin temperature reduces the hypothalamic set point for sweating and increases the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the hypothalamic [[feedback]] system in response to variations in core [[temperature]]. Overall, however, the sweating response to a rise in hypothalamic ('core') temperature is much larger than the response to the same increase in average skin temperature.\n\nSweating causes a decrease in core temperature through evaporative cooling at the skin surface. As high energy molecules evaporate from the skin, releasing energy absorbed from the body, the skin and superficial vessels decrease in temperature. Cooled venous blood then returns to the body's core and counteracts rising core temperatures.\n\nThere are two situations in which the nerves will stimulate the sweat glands, causing perspiration: during physical heat and during emotional stress. In general, emotionally induced sweating is restricted to [[Palm (hand)|palm]]s, [[Sole (foot)|sole]]s, [[armpit]]s, and sometimes the [[forehead]], while physical heat-induced sweating occurs throughout the body.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(97)00642-9 |first1=Tomoya |last1=Kameia |first2=Takao |last2=Tsudab |first3=Shinya |last3=Kitagawab |first4=Ken |last4=Naitoha |first5=Koji |last5=Nakashimaa |first6=Toshio |last6=Ohhashi |date=June 1998 |title=Physical stimuli and emotional stress-induced sweat secretions in the human palm and forehead |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=365 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=319\u2013326}}</ref>\n\nPeople have an average of two to four million sweat glands. But how much sweat is released by each gland is determined by many factors, including gender, genetics, environmental conditions, age or fitness level. Two of the major contributors to sweat rate are an individual's fitness level and weight. If an individual weighs more, sweat rate is likely to increase because the body must exert more energy to function and there is more body mass to cool down.  On the other hand, a fit person will start sweating earlier and more readily. As someone becomes fit, the body becomes more efficient at regulating the body's temperature and sweat glands adapt along with the body's other systems.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Julieann|title=The Science of Sweat|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/may/the-science-of-sweat|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055518/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/may/the-science-of-sweat|archive-date=2013-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSweat is not pure [[water]]; it always contains a small amount (0.2\u20131%) of [[Solution|solute]]. When a person moves from a [[cold]] [[climate]] to a [[Temperature|hot]] climate, adaptive changes occur in the sweating mechanisms of the person. This process is referred to as [[acclimatisation]]: the maximum rate of sweating increases and its solute composition decreases. The volume of water lost in sweat daily is highly variable, ranging from 100 to 8,000 mL/day. The solute loss can be as much as 350&nbsp;mmol/d (or 90&nbsp;mmol/d acclimatised) of [[sodium]] under the most extreme conditions. During average intensity exercise, sweat losses can average up to 2 litres of water/hour.  In a cool climate and in the absence of [[exercise]], sodium loss can be very low (less than 5 mmol/d). Sodium concentration in sweat is 30-65&nbsp;mmol/l, depending on the degree of acclimatisation.\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:TranspirationPerspirationCommonsFL.jpg|thumb|alt=Close-up of beads of sweat|Beads of sweat emerging from [[eccrine gland]]s]]\n\nSweat is mostly [[water]].

They compete in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership, as well as the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] junior competitions.\n\nThe club was admitted to the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership]], predecessor of the current NRL competition, in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1935|1935]]. They won their first premiership in their fourth year of competition with another soon after, and after spending the 1950s and most of the 1960s on the lower rungs went through a very strong period in the 1980s, winning four premierships in that decade.\n\nKnown briefly in the 1990s as the '''Sydney Bulldogs''', as a result of the [[Super League war]] the club competed in that competition in 1997 before changing their name to the geographically indistinct '''Bulldogs''' and continuing to play every season of the re-unified NRL, winning their most recent premiership in [[2004 NRL season|2004]]. In 2012, Canterbury won the minor premiership, but lost to the [[Melbourne Storm]] 14\u20134 in the Grand Final, in October. In 2014, they came from 7th to make the Grand Final against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]], but lost 30\u20136.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/rabbitohs-break-long-drought-with-fairytale-win/tabid/10874/newsid/82374/default.aspx|title=Rabbitohs break long drought with fairytale win|date=5 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs}}\n[[File:Canterbury Bankstown Rugby League Football Club's third annual Ball from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The third annual Club Ball, 1938, from the Tom Lennon collection, courtesy of the Powerhouse Museum]]\nIn 1935\u2014thirteen years after a meeting above \"The Ideal Milk Bar\" in [[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]] led to the creation of the Canterbury-Bankstown Junior Rugby League\u2014the Canterbury club was admitted into the elite New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. It took the new club, nicknamed \"Country Bumpkins\" because of their rural recruiting and CB emblem, four years to win their first premiership in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1938|1938]]. The grand final-winning effort was repeated in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1942|1942]] before a 38-year premiership drought.\n\nIn [[NSWRFL season 1967|1967]], having ended the 11-year premiership reign of [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] by defeating them in the final, \"The Berries\" (as they were known at the time) lost to [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] in the Grand Final. But the return to the top end of the table set the scene for off-field restructuring that laid the foundations for the club to become one of the most consistent achievers in the remaining decades of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1978, Canterbury became known as \"The Bulldogs\". Nicknames such as \"Cantabs\" \"CBs\" and \"Berries\" were seen to be \"soft\" and the club wanted something to signify determination and grit. A grand final appearance in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1979|1979]], followed by a grand final win in [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]] with a young, enthusiastic and free-running side dubbed \"The Entertainers\", was the beginning of a golden era that was to produce three more grand final wins in the 1980s: [[NSWRL season 1984|1984]], [[NSWRL season 1985|1985]] and [[NSWRL season 1988|1988]].\n\n[[File:CBankstownbulldogs.JPG|thumb|[[1980 NSWRFL season|1980 NRL Grand Final]] artwork]]\nDuring the mid-1990s' [[Super League war]], Canterbury aligned themselves with the Super League competition, playing in the [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997 premiership season]]. In [[1998 NRL season|1998]] the Bulldogs came close to adding another premiership trophy after qualifying for the Grand Final where they met the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and lost 38\u201312. On the way to the 1998 Grand Final, Canterbury had two come-from-behind wins. The first was against the Newcastle Knights in the third week of the finals\u2014behind 16\u20130 in the second half, they fought back to 16 all at full time and went on to win in extra time. A week later they trailed arch rivals Parramatta in the preliminary final by 16 points with 9 minutes remaining. Three tries and a conversion from the sideline by [[Daryl Halligan]] in the final minutes got them back level at 18 all and send the game into extra-time. Canterbury eventually went on to win 32\u201320 in one of the greatest finals comebacks in the history of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2015/09/24/top-10-preliminary-final-heartbreaks/|title=Top 10 preliminary final heartbreaks|website=www.nrl.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bulldogs.com.au/news/2014/08/12/memorable-match-1998-preliminary-final/|title=Memorable Match: 1998 Preliminary Final|website=www.bulldogs.com.au}}</ref>\n\nFollowing indifferent form in 1999, 2000 and 2001 where they had varying levels of success, the club was found to have systematically and deliberately breached the NRL [[salary cap]] in 2002 (for the 2001\u201302 seasons), and was penalised all 37 competition points which it had amassed up to that point for 2002. This resulted in the club falling from first to last place on the ladder, and at the end of the season the Bulldogs received their first \"wooden spoon\" (a reference to the club which finishes last in the competition) since [[1964 NSWRFL season|1964]].\n\nThe Bulldogs returned to finals contention in [[2003 NRL season|2003]]; however, they fell one step short of yet another Grand Final after losing to the Roosters 28\u201318 in the Preliminary Final.\n\nThe club went through some off-field dramas in 2004, the most serious of which included rape allegations during a pre-season match in [[Coffs Harbour]]. The team managed to focus on football and triumphed when they held out the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16\u201313 with a try-saving tackle by [[Andrew Ryan (rugby league)|Andrew Ryan]] in the dying seconds of the 2004 Grand Final. The game was to be the last for departing captain [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]], but he missed the match due to a leg injury. Price is now taking over at the club as the General Manager of Football. This position becoming effective in 2020 as he looks to turn the clubs fortunes around to that of 2004.\n\n[[2005 NRL season|2005]] saw the Bulldogs unable to mount a serious defence of their premiership title as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team was under-strength for most of the year. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, with the club suffering successive heavy losses and missing the finals series. In [[2006 NRL season|2006]], little was expected from the club after a poor 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing a game short of the Grand Final, losing to eventual premiers the [[Brisbane Broncos]]. Inconsistency and a poor finish to the [[2007 NRL season|2007 season]] meant Canterbury were knocked out of the finals in week two.\n\nIn [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008]], having already lost [[Mark O'Meley]] to the Sydney Roosters, [[Willie Mason]] left the club. Further into the off-season the Bulldogs also lost halfback [[Brent Sherwin]], and prospects for the 2008 season began to look dim. Although they recorded at the start of the season a couple of victories, the injury toll and the departure [[Sonny Bill Williams]] mid-season demoralised the club and players, and the Bulldogs earned their second wooden spoon of the decade.\n\nAnother source of discontent in 2008 was the battle for election to the football club board. Many contenders believed that the board of the time was steering the club in the wrong direction, particularly then-[[CEO]] Malcolm Noad. New members were elected to the board early in 2008, and later in the season Noad resigned as CEO. His replacement as head of the football club was [[Todd Greenberg]].\n\nGreenberg's influence became apparent during the [[2009 NRL season|2009 season]]. Premiership-winning coach Steve Folkes was replaced with his assistant [[Kevin Moore (rugby league)|Kevin Moore]]. The purchases of several key players, including former Melbourne and Cronulla playmaker [[Brett Kimmorley]] changed the Bulldogs from a poorly run and poorly performing club to one of the best clubs both on and off the field in 2009. Canterbury finished second in the regular season (losing the minor premiership to the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] due to a loss of two competition points for an interchange breach against [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] in Round 2), and players and officials took out a number of Dally M awards. 2009 was also the final season for [[Hazem El Masri]], who became the highest all-time pointscorer in Australian rugby league history with a penalty goal in the Bulldogs' Round 1 match against the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n\nFrom [[2010 NRL season|2010]], the Bulldogs returned to the name Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.<ref name=\"Ritchie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/bulldogs-change-name-back-to-canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/story-e6frexnr-1225766904295|title=Bulldogs change name back to Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|date=28 August 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref> The Canterbury-Bankstown club celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010.\n\nIn the [[2012 NRL season]], Canterbury finished first on the competition ladder to take out their first minor premiership since 1994.

Canterbury reached the grand final after winning 3 sudden death finals matches against Melbourne, Manly-Warringah and Penrith.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/south-sydney-rabbitohs-win-2014-nrl-grand-final-defeating-canterbury-bulldogs-306/news-story/8016f779194e71814b5118263ffbf713/|title=South Sydney Rabbitohs win 2014 NRL grand final, defeating Canterbury Bulldogs 30-6|website=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 August 2017, Canterbury announced Rugby League World Cup CEO Andrew Hill as the replacement for outgoing boss Raelene Castle. On the appointment, chairman Ray Dib noted that \"Andrew was appointed from a very strong list of candidates and has exceptional experience in the game of rugby league.\"\n\nIn September 2017, Canterbury announced that former premiership winning player [[Dean Pay]] would be the new coach at the club starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-28/dean-pay-the-new-bulldogs-coach-replacing-des-hasler/8997400|title=Dean Pay the new Bulldogs coach, replacing Des Hasler|date=28 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2018 NRL season]] started off badly for Canterbury with the club only winning 3 of its first 10 matches. In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due the salary cap drama engulfing the club. The issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach [[Des Hasler]] who signed numerous players on back ended deals. In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap. This resulted in [[Moses Mbye]] departing for the [[Wests Tigers]] and star recruit [[Aaron Woods]] being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior. On 16 June 2018, Canterbury suffered a humiliating 32\u201310 loss to the [[Gold Coast Titans]] at Belmore, in the press conference coach Dean Pay said \"Physically, we just weren't good enough.

Due to the bad start to the season, there were rumours that coach [[Dean Pay]] would be relieved of his duties but he was then granted a 12-month contract extension to remain as Canterbury coach until the end of 2020.\n\nBy the midway part of the 2019 season, Canterbury-Bankstown found themselves sitting last on the table and in real danger of finishing with the wooden spoon. However, for the third straight season, Canterbury achieved four upset victories in a row over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]], the [[Wests Tigers]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table. Pay was credited with the late season revival as the side focused heavily on defence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/spoons-of-wood-high-hopes-and-chances-lost-the-final-round-storylines-20190905-p52o87.html/|title=Spoons of wood, high hopes and chances lost... the final round storylines|website=Brisbane Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/09/01/the-dean-pay-way-unashamedly-old-school/|title=The Dean Pay way: 'Unashamedly' old school|website=NRL}}</ref>\n\n==Name and emblem==\nThe name and emblem of the club has changed several times over its history. At the club's foundation in 1935, it was known only as 'Canterbury-Bankstown', without an animal mascot. The nicknames 'Berries' and 'C-Bs' (or, derisively, 'Country Bumpkins') were often used informally, 'C-Bs' being used from the outset and 'Berries' coming into use by the mid-1940s. The club had been referred to as the 'Bulldogs' as early as 1977.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Clarkson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kf5jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4468,8454916|title=More Bulldogs out for cup|date=26 July 1977|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=40}}</ref> In 1978, the Bulldog mascot and name was adopted, with the club becoming known as the 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs'. This was the name used throughout the team's 1980s glory era. In 1995 the club name was changed to 'Sydney Bulldogs', reflecting a similar change by [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] (to 'Sydney City Roosters'). The name changed again in 1996, returning to 'Canterbury Bulldogs' with 'Bankstown' omitted, and yet again in 2000, to the geographically indistinct 'Bulldogs'. Bob Hagan, the club boss at the time of the 2000 change, explained that the dropping of the name 'Canterbury' was intended to broaden the appeal of the club outside of its traditional supporter base, so that the club could attract a geographically diverse following like [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] or the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Despite the name change, some supporters, as well as many television and radio commentators, continued to refer to the club as 'Canterbury'. In the most recent change, board officials voted in late 2009 for the club to return to 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs' from the 2010 season onwards.\n\nThe initial crest was a 'C-B' in a shield. The adoption of the 'Bulldogs' name and mascot took place in 1978. There have been three main versions of the mascot logo. The first, which featured a snarling bulldog inside a circle, was replaced in 1998 by a more 'cartoonish' logo of a bulldog's head. In 2009, the club announced that the logo would be changing again, and asked members to vote on which of two similar proposed logos would be used from 2010. The rationale for the logo change was to celebrate the club's 75th anniversary in 2010 and to better reflect the club's \"true essence and history\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=15573|date=13 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922045727/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=15573|archivedate=22 September 2009|work=bulldogs.com.au|publisher=Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|title=Bulldogs Members Vote on New Logo}}</ref> Two months later, the new design was unveiled, with the official change of logo taking place in November 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bulldgos New Logo Announced|url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=17057|work=bulldogs.com.au|publisher=Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|date=3 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922051103/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=17057|archivedate=22 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The current logo returns to the standing bulldog of the 1978\u20131997 logo, although it is no longer snarling. It also references elements of the club's history by incorporating the 'C-B' emblem, the club's year of foundation (1935), and the blue and white 'V' design which has featured on many of the club's jerseys over the years. The change of name from 'Bulldogs' to 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs' took place after the new logo was unveiled.\n\n<gallery  class=\"center\" perrow=\"4\" align=\"center\" caption=\"Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs - Logos\">\nImage:Bulldogs 1935 Logo.svg|1935-1977\nImage:Canterbury-bankstown bulldogs 1980s logo.jpg|1978-1997\nImage:BullDogs.svg|1998-2009\nImage:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs logo.svg|2010\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\n==Colours==\nThe Bulldogs have played in predominantly blue and white strip since the club entered the league in 1935. The only exception to this was during the Second World War, when rationing meant they had to wear a maroon jersey with a blue 'V'.\n\nThere have been three basic strip designs since the club's inception in the top-flight league competition:\n* The irregular (\"butcher stripes\") stripes design which was used from 1935 until at least 1962.\n\nThis design had blue and white irregular stripes worn with black shorts.\nThe irregular strip has been used recently in occasional 'heritage' matches (e.g. Heritage round in 2008 vs St. George Illawarra)\n* The 'V Strip' \u2013 used between 1966 and 1968, and revived in 1974.\nWhite shirt with blue V, blue shorts.\nThe current \"away\" strip has blue shorts, but features a blue shirt with white V.\n* From 1969 to 1973, the club adopted a jersey featuring blue and white hoops.\nThis reverted to the 'V Strip' from 1974 onwards.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" perrow=\"5\" align=\"center\" caption=\"Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs - home jerseys\">\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1935.svg|1935\u20131942, 1947\u20131965\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1943.svg|1943\u20131946\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1969.svg|1969\u20131973\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1966.svg|1966\u20131968, 1974\u20131996, 2013-present\nImage:Canterbury Bulldogs home jersey 1997.svg|1997\u20132012\n</gallery>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Stadium Australia 2.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]]]\nIn their inaugural season, very few home matches were allocated to the Canterbury-Bankstown club. However, when the opportunity arose the club took their matches to either [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] or [[Pratten Park]]. From the following season, the club began to base itself at [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. The club had a long-time affinity with the ground and stayed there continuously until 1994.\n[[File:Belmore Sports Ground.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Belmore Sports Ground]]]]\nIn 1995 when the [[Super League War]] began to come about, the club changed its playing name to the \"Sydney Bulldogs\" in an attempt to broaden its fan base and played matches at [[Parramatta Stadium]] where spectator facilities were of a higher class. This move paid off with the club going on to become premiers that season. However, the club reverted its name to Canterbury for the 1996 season and once again played matches out of Belmore Sports Ground; something that lasted up until the inaugural [[National Rugby League]] season of 1998.\n\n[[File:Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Interior of [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]]]\nOnce the new [[Stadium Australia]] had been finished and opened in preparation for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]], the club began to play matches there between 1999 and 2000. From 2001 to 2005, the club then began to play matches out of the new [[Sydney Showground Stadium|Sydney Showground]] at [[Homebush Bay, New South Wales|Homebush Bay]], with bigger matches played out of the then-Telstra Stadium from 2003. When fans began to complain about the poor quality of the Showground venue as a [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league ground]], the club eventually decided to move all future home matches to the Stadium, where the club remains. In 2008, Telstra Stadium became known as ANZ Stadium due to a naming rights change.\n\nThe club's training and administration offices remained at Belmore Sports Ground until the beginning of 2008, but were relocated to Sydney Olympic Park during the 2008 season. With the NSW Government committing to upgrading Belmore Sports Ground, the club administration and training has now been returned to the historical ground after a $9 million upgrade.\n\nIn 2015, the club played two home games at their traditional home ground [[Belmore Sports Ground]] as part of the club's 80th-anniversary celebrations, and have since continued to play some games at Belmore.\n\n==Supporters==\n[[File:Belmoreoval1.jpg|thumb|Belmore Oval, Crowd at 2016 \"Return to Belmore\" match, where the Bulldogs defeated the Melbourne Storm.]]\nThe Bulldogs Army is the core [[supporter group]] for the Bulldogs, with the section they sit within known as 'The Kennel'. To be sitting in this section, supporters must become a member of the club itself and register any large flags and/or banners which are brought to the game. At all away games the Bulldogs Army locates themselves in the general admission section. The main aim of the Bulldogs Army is to show support and passion for the Bulldogs.\n\nAs the region's traditional local representatives, the Bulldogs predominantly draw on a support base in and around the districts of [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] in [[south-western Sydney]], although in recent years club administration and home matches have relocated to [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. The Bulldogs are the most supported NRL club in regional NSW\u2014over 25% of Bulldog fans are located in regional NSW, over 25% are located outside of NSW and over 10% are located in Queensland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=membership-2011 |title=Bulldogs 2011 |accessdate=2015-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020022627/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=membership-2011 |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club has one of the highest average attendances in the league: over the [[2010 NRL season|2010 season]], it was one of only two clubs to record an average home crowd of more than 20,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2010.html |title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances 2010 / Canterbury |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607084350/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2010.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe multicultural demographics of the suburbs in the club's support base, such as [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]], means the club has a large number of supporters from a range of non-Anglo ethnicities. In recent years the club has become particularly identified in the media with the [[Lebanese Australians|Lebanese]] and the [[Greek Australians|Greek]] community, particularly with the club's former star goalkicker [[Hazem El Masri]], who migrated from [[Lebanon]] as a young child. The Greek community has a huge history of Greeks playing for the club dating back to the 1970s with club legend [[George Peponis]], who migrated from [[Greece]] as a very young child who captained the Bulldogs and Australia. El Masri retired at the end of the 2009 season.\n\n=== Notable supporters ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n* [[Tahir Bilgic]], Actor, Comedian, Writer and Creator\n* [[Don

Eels===\nThe rivalry between the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Parramatta Eels is one of the fiercest in the NRL. The two clubs have been geographically close throughout their whole histories. In the 1980s, Canterbury and Parramatta both won four premierships each and met in two Grand Finals in 1984 and 1986. In the 1990s, at the height of the super league war, Parramatta signed four of Canterbury's star players [[Jarrod McCracken]], [[Dean Pay]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] which helped Parramatta reach the finals for the first time in eleven years, in the 1998 Preliminary Final, Parramatta were winning against Canterbury 18\u20132 with less than ten minutes to play when Canterbury staged one of the biggest comebacks finals comebacks defeating Parramatta 32\u201320 in extra time. In the [[2009 NRL season]], Parramatta defeated Canterbury in the preliminary final to cap off a remarkable run to the Grand Final. The crowd which attended the match was a non Grand Final record of 74,000 fans. Speaking of the rivalry in 2015, former Canterbury player [[James Graham (rugby league)|James Graham]] said \"As soon as I came to this club, I was told that they were the closest club to us and that there was no love lost between players and fans\". [[Andrew Ryan (rugby league)|Andrew Ryan]] who played for both clubs said \"Both clubs do speak about the rivalry, in the change room and leading into the clashes, they always want to get the wood on their rival, I went for Canterbury when I was a kid, but then got my first opportunity in first grade to play for Parramatta. They place a huge amount of emphasis on the game. I think I was one of the only players to go the other way, a lot of players who had played for the Bulldogs allayed first the Eels, not too many went the other way\".\n\n===Sydney Roosters===\nThe Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have a long-standing rivalry with fellow team the [[Sydney Roosters]], Whilst both teams had crossed premiership paths in Grand Finals in four occasions. In 1938, Canterbury-Bankstown won their first premiership against the Eastern Suburbs as what they were known as back then winning 19\u20136 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Two years later in 1940, the sides met again with the Easts winning the 1940 NSWRFL Grand Final 24\u201314. In 1980, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs broke a 38-year premiership drought defeating the Eastern Suburbs Roosters 18\u20134 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nIn 2002, the Sydney Roosters won the NRL Premiership on the back of a 9-game winning streak. This was the same year the premiership favourite Bulldogs were stripped of 37 points due to systematic systematic breaches of the salary cap in [[2001 NRL season|2001]] and [[2002 NRL season|2002]], in 2003, the Roosters proved themselves worthy of defending premiers title when they defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final 28\u201318 in front of a sold out Aussie Stadium. In 2004, the Roosters defeated Canterbury 35\u20130 and fighting broke out in the stands during and after the game had been completed. While the Roosters finished the regular season with the Minor Premiership, Canterbury defeated them in the Grand Final 16\u201313 after trailing 13\u20136 at half time.\n\nAs of the [[2019 NRL season]], the last time the two clubs met in a finals game was the 2015 Elimination Final which the Roosters won 38\u201312 at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n===St. George Illawarra Dragons===\nThe Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have a fierce rivalry with neighbour the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]]. Canterbury-Bankstown were founded in 1935, fourteen years after [[St. George Dragons]], St. George inflicted a premiership record 91\u20136 victory over Canterbury in 1935 but Canterbury enjoyed premiership success first in 1938 and St. George in 1942. In the [[1942 NSWRFL season]], the two clubs met in the Grand Final with Canterbury-Bankstown defeating St. George 11\u20139 in a low-scoring affair at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After that however, St. George recorded eleven straight premierships in the years following 1955\u20131966. It was also Canterbury who put an end to their Premiership run in 1967, when they beat them by a point in the preliminary final to face South Sydney in the Grand Final. Since then, both clubs inflicted Premiership defeats on the other, with the St. George Dragons defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in their last Grand Final success in 1979, the Bulldogs returned the favour in 1985.\n\nThe two teams subsequently met in the 1993 preliminary final which St. George defeated Canterbury 27\u201312. They would meet again in the 1995 and 1998 finals series with Canterbury running out winners on both occasions. The elimination final in 1998 was also St. George's last game as a stand-alone entity as the club elected to form a joint venture with [[Illawarra Steelers|Illawarra]] for the [[1999 NRL season]].\n\n==Canterbury League Club==\nThe Canterbury League Club is the licensed club of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Canterbury League Club first opened its doors for trade in September 1956 to service the needs of the football club and local community. The Salvation Army Hall became the first venue of the Canterbury League Club. Sixty people would fill the venue on a busy night.\n\nIn the first two years of trade the Club was outgrowing itself and in 1960 the Club moved its premises to Bridge St which allowed the League Club to grow as well as cater for patron parking.\n\nDuring the 1990s Canterbury managed one of the most successful league clubs in NSW and was quickly becoming known as one of the most progressive leisure facilities in Australia.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} With trade booming and patronage at an all-time high, the Club extended its trading to 24-hour trading.\n\nIn 2000, the Board had approved major renovations. The renovations started in 2000 and in 2002 the Banyan Brasserie, Dynasty Restaurant, new foyer, level 1 and health club were opened to the public.\n\nThe Club also amalgamated with Lakemba Services Memorial Club (2008) & Belfield RSL (2013).\n\nCanterbury League Club has since become one of Sydney's premier hospitality destinations with 5-star amenities including three restaurants, two coffee shops, multiple bars and entertainment lounges and a 24-hour health club.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.canterbury.com.au/history|accessdate = 15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics and records==\n{{details|List of Bulldogs records}}\n[[Hazem El Masri]] holds the NRL record for the most games played for the club, having made 317 appearances in total.\n\nHazem El Masri also holds records for the most points scored, the most tries scored and the most points scored for the Bulldogs. Since his debut in 1996, he has scored a total of 2,418 points\u2014which was also a competition record for Rugby League in Australia until 2019. Former player [[Daryl Halligan]], who retired with the club in 2000, had previously held the competition record for most points scored with 2,034, which included points scored whilst at his former club the [[North Sydney Bears]].\n\nThe club's largest win occurred in 1995 when they played as the \"Sydney Bulldogs.\" In a match against the newly formed [[North Queensland Cowboys]], the Bulldogs won 66\u20134. In the club's first season in 1935 they were subject to the two heaviest defeats in competition history two weeks in succession. Firstly, they lost to St. George 91\u20136 and the following week to Eastern Suburbs 87\u20137. However, despite these big losses, the club was able to secure their first premiership 3 years later in 1938 in the [[Grand Final]] against Eastern Suburbs; at the same time setting the record for becoming the quickest non-foundation club to win a title. This record was not broken until 1999.\n\nIn 2002, the club won 17 matches in a row after getting beaten by [[New Zealand Warriors]]; falling just two short of the record set by the Eastern Suburbs team of 1975.\n\nIn Round 7 of the 2014 season, after beating the South Sydney Rabbitohs 15\u201314, the Bulldogs became the first club to win three consecutive matches by 1 point. They went on to be runners up to South Sydney Rabbitohs in the grandfinal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2228671/canterbury-bulldogs-snatch-one-point-win-over-south-sydney-rabbitohs-photos/|title=Canterbury Bulldogs snatch one-point win over South Sydney Rabbitohs - PHOTOS|date=19 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, the Bulldogs played the Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium in front of 40,523 spectators.\n\n==Season summaries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|+ P=Premiers, R=Runner-Ups, M=Minor Premierships, F=Finals Appearance, W=Wooden Spoons <br/> (brackets represent finals games)\n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!

They won their first premiership in their fourth year of competition with another soon after, and after spending the 1950s and most of the 1960s on the lower rungs went through a very strong period in the 1980s, winning four premierships in that decade.\n\nKnown briefly in the 1990s as the '''Sydney Bulldogs''', as a result of the [[Super League war]] the club competed in that competition in 1997 before changing their name to the geographically indistinct '''Bulldogs''' and continuing to play every season of the re-unified NRL, winning their most recent premiership in [[2004 NRL season|2004]]. In 2012, Canterbury won the minor premiership, but lost to the [[Melbourne Storm]] 14\u20134 in the Grand Final, in October. In 2014, they came from 7th to make the Grand Final against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]], but lost 30\u20136.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/rabbitohs-break-long-drought-with-fairytale-win/tabid/10874/newsid/82374/default.aspx|title=Rabbitohs break long drought with fairytale win|date=5 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs}}\n[[File:Canterbury Bankstown Rugby League Football Club's third annual Ball from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The third annual Club Ball, 1938, from the Tom Lennon collection, courtesy of the Powerhouse Museum]]\nIn 1935\u2014thirteen years after a meeting above \"The Ideal Milk Bar\" in [[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]] led to the creation of the Canterbury-Bankstown Junior Rugby League\u2014the Canterbury club was admitted into the elite New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. It took the new club, nicknamed \"Country Bumpkins\" because of their rural recruiting and CB emblem, four years to win their first premiership in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1938|1938]]. The grand final-winning effort was repeated in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1942|1942]] before a 38-year premiership drought.\n\nIn [[NSWRFL season 1967|1967]], having ended the 11-year premiership reign of [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] by defeating them in the final, \"The Berries\" (as they were known at the time) lost to [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] in the Grand Final. But the return to the top end of the table set the scene for off-field restructuring that laid the foundations for the club to become one of the most consistent achievers in the remaining decades of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1978, Canterbury became known as \"The Bulldogs\". Nicknames such as \"Cantabs\" \"CBs\" and \"Berries\" were seen to be \"soft\" and the club wanted something to signify determination and grit. A grand final appearance in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1979|1979]], followed by a grand final win in [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]] with a young, enthusiastic and free-running side dubbed \"The Entertainers\", was the beginning of a golden era that was to produce three more grand final wins in the 1980s: [[NSWRL season 1984|1984]], [[NSWRL season 1985|1985]] and [[NSWRL season 1988|1988]].\n\n[[File:CBankstownbulldogs.JPG|thumb|[[1980 NSWRFL season|1980 NRL Grand Final]] artwork]]\nDuring the mid-1990s' [[Super League war]], Canterbury aligned themselves with the Super League competition, playing in the [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997 premiership season]]. In [[1998 NRL season|1998]] the Bulldogs came close to adding another premiership trophy after qualifying for the Grand Final where they met the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and lost 38\u201312. On the way to the 1998 Grand Final, Canterbury had two come-from-behind wins. The first was against the Newcastle Knights in the third week of the finals\u2014behind 16\u20130 in the second half, they fought back to 16 all at full time and went on to win in extra time. A week later they trailed arch rivals Parramatta in the preliminary final by 16 points with 9 minutes remaining. Three tries and a conversion from the sideline by [[Daryl Halligan]] in the final minutes got them back level at 18 all and send the game into extra-time. Canterbury eventually went on to win 32\u201320 in one of the greatest finals comebacks in the history of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2015/09/24/top-10-preliminary-final-heartbreaks/|title=Top 10 preliminary final heartbreaks|website=www.nrl.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bulldogs.com.au/news/2014/08/12/memorable-match-1998-preliminary-final/|title=Memorable Match: 1998 Preliminary Final|website=www.bulldogs.com.au}}</ref>\n\nFollowing indifferent form in 1999, 2000 and 2001 where they had varying levels of success, the club was found to have systematically and deliberately breached the NRL [[salary cap]] in 2002 (for the 2001\u201302 seasons), and was penalised all 37 competition points which it had amassed up to that point for 2002. This resulted in the club falling from first to last place on the ladder, and at the end of the season the Bulldogs received their first \"wooden spoon\" (a reference to the club which finishes last in the competition) since [[1964 NSWRFL season|1964]].\n\nThe Bulldogs returned to finals contention in [[2003 NRL season|2003]]; however, they fell one step short of yet another Grand Final after losing to the Roosters 28\u201318 in the Preliminary Final.\n\nThe club went through some off-field dramas in 2004, the most serious of which included rape allegations during a pre-season match in [[Coffs Harbour]]. The team managed to focus on football and triumphed when they held out the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16\u201313 with a try-saving tackle by [[Andrew Ryan (rugby league)|Andrew Ryan]] in the dying seconds of the 2004 Grand Final. The game was to be the last for departing captain [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]], but he missed the match due to a leg injury. Price is now taking over at the club as the General Manager of Football. This position becoming effective in 2020 as he looks to turn the clubs fortunes around to that of 2004.\n\n[[2005 NRL season|2005]] saw the Bulldogs unable to mount a serious defence of their premiership title as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team was under-strength for most of the year. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, with the club suffering successive heavy losses and missing the finals series. In [[2006 NRL season|2006]], little was expected from the club after a poor 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing a game short of the Grand Final, losing to eventual premiers the [[Brisbane Broncos]]. Inconsistency and a poor finish to the [[2007 NRL season|2007 season]] meant Canterbury were knocked out of the finals in week two.\n\nIn [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008]], having already lost [[Mark O'Meley]] to the Sydney Roosters, [[Willie Mason]] left the club. Further into the off-season the Bulldogs also lost halfback [[Brent Sherwin]], and prospects for the 2008 season began to look dim. Although they recorded at the start of the season a couple of victories, the injury toll and the departure [[Sonny Bill Williams]] mid-season demoralised the club and players, and the Bulldogs earned their second wooden spoon of the decade.\n\nAnother source of discontent in 2008 was the battle for election to the football club board. Many contenders believed that the board of the time was steering the club in the wrong direction, particularly then-[[CEO]] Malcolm Noad. New members were elected to the board early in 2008, and later in the season Noad resigned as CEO. His replacement as head of the football club was [[Todd Greenberg]].\n\nGreenberg's influence became apparent during the [[2009 NRL season|2009 season]]. Premiership-winning coach Steve Folkes was replaced with his assistant [[Kevin Moore (rugby league)|Kevin Moore]]. The purchases of several key players, including former Melbourne and Cronulla playmaker [[Brett Kimmorley]] changed the Bulldogs from a poorly run and poorly performing club to one of the best clubs both on and off the field in 2009. Canterbury finished second in the regular season (losing the minor premiership to the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] due to a loss of two competition points for an interchange breach against [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] in Round 2), and players and officials took out a number of Dally M awards. 2009 was also the final season for [[Hazem El Masri]], who became the highest all-time pointscorer in Australian rugby league history with a penalty goal in the Bulldogs' Round 1 match against the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n\nFrom [[2010 NRL season|2010]], the Bulldogs returned to the name Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.<ref name=\"Ritchie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/bulldogs-change-name-back-to-canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/story-e6frexnr-1225766904295|title=Bulldogs change name back to Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|date=28 August 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref> The Canterbury-Bankstown club celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010.\n\nIn the [[2012 NRL season]], Canterbury finished first on the competition ladder to take out their first minor premiership since 1994.

Canterbury reached the grand final after winning 3 sudden death finals matches against Melbourne, Manly-Warringah and Penrith.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/south-sydney-rabbitohs-win-2014-nrl-grand-final-defeating-canterbury-bulldogs-306/news-story/8016f779194e71814b5118263ffbf713/|title=South Sydney Rabbitohs win 2014 NRL grand final, defeating Canterbury Bulldogs 30-6|website=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 August 2017, Canterbury announced Rugby League World Cup CEO Andrew Hill as the replacement for outgoing boss Raelene Castle. On the appointment, chairman Ray Dib noted that \"Andrew was appointed from a very strong list of candidates and has exceptional experience in the game of rugby league.\"\n\nIn September 2017, Canterbury announced that former premiership winning player [[Dean Pay]] would be the new coach at the club starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-28/dean-pay-the-new-bulldogs-coach-replacing-des-hasler/8997400|title=Dean Pay the new Bulldogs coach, replacing Des Hasler|date=28 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2018 NRL season]] started off badly for Canterbury with the club only winning 3 of its first 10 matches. In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due the salary cap drama engulfing the club. The issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach [[Des Hasler]] who signed numerous players on back ended deals. In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap. This resulted in [[Moses Mbye]] departing for the [[Wests Tigers]] and star recruit [[Aaron Woods]] being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior. On 16 June 2018, Canterbury suffered a humiliating 32\u201310 loss to the [[Gold Coast Titans]] at Belmore, in the press conference coach Dean Pay said \"Physically, we just weren't good enough. The way they turned up, the way they trained during the week wasn't good enough, I feel sorry for the fans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/i-feel-sorry-for-fans-dogs-coach-dean-pay-slams-canterbury-players-as-club-slumps-to-historic-low/news-story/d0b5c39f6275d466bb6d58d676cf6fe1|title=\u2018I feel sorry for fans\u2019: Dogs coach slams players for horrorshow|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/06/27/canterbury-bulldogs-rubbish-rebuild-talk-despite-aaron-woods-moses-mbye-exits/|title=Canterbury Bulldogs rubbish rebuild talk despite Aaron Woods, Moses Mbye exits|date=27 June 2018|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\nOn 20 July 2018, Canterbury played against arch rivals Parramatta in what the media had dubbed as the \"Spoon Bowl\" with both sides sitting at the bottom of the ladder.

Due to the bad start to the season, there were rumours that coach [[Dean Pay]] would be relieved of his duties but he was then granted a 12-month contract extension to remain as Canterbury coach until the end of 2020.\n\nBy the midway part of the 2019 season, Canterbury-Bankstown found themselves sitting last on the table and in real danger of finishing with the wooden spoon. However, for the third straight season, Canterbury achieved four upset victories in a row over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]], the [[Wests Tigers]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table.

At the club's foundation in 1935, it was known only as 'Canterbury-Bankstown', without an animal mascot. The nicknames 'Berries' and 'C-Bs' (or, derisively, 'Country Bumpkins') were often used informally, 'C-Bs' being used from the outset and 'Berries' coming into use by the mid-1940s. The club had been referred to as the 'Bulldogs' as early as 1977.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Clarkson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kf5jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4468,8454916|title=More Bulldogs out for cup|date=26 July 1977|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=40}}</ref> In 1978, the Bulldog mascot and name was adopted, with the club becoming known as the 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs'. This was the name used throughout the team's 1980s glory era. In 1995 the club name was changed to 'Sydney Bulldogs', reflecting a similar change by [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] (to 'Sydney City Roosters'). The name changed again in 1996, returning to 'Canterbury Bulldogs' with 'Bankstown' omitted, and yet again in 2000, to the geographically indistinct 'Bulldogs'. Bob Hagan, the club boss at the time of the 2000 change, explained that the dropping of the name 'Canterbury' was intended to broaden the appeal of the club outside of its traditional supporter base, so that the club could attract a geographically diverse following like [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] or the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Despite the name change, some supporters, as well as many television and radio commentators, continued to refer to the club as 'Canterbury'. In the most recent change, board officials voted in late 2009 for the club to return to 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs' from the 2010 season onwards.\n\nThe initial crest was a 'C-B' in a shield. The adoption of the 'Bulldogs' name and mascot took place in 1978. There have been three main versions of the mascot logo. The first, which featured a snarling bulldog inside a circle, was replaced in 1998 by a more 'cartoonish' logo of a bulldog's head. In 2009, the club announced that the logo would be changing again, and asked members to vote on which of two similar proposed logos would be used from 2010. The rationale for the logo change was to celebrate the club's 75th anniversary in 2010 and to better reflect the club's \"true essence and history\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=15573|date=13 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922045727/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=15573|archivedate=22 September 2009|work=bulldogs.com.au|publisher=Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|title=Bulldogs Members Vote on New Logo}}</ref> Two months later, the new design was unveiled, with the official change of logo taking place in November 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bulldgos New Logo Announced|url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=17057|work=bulldogs.com.au|publisher=Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|date=3 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922051103/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=article-display&id=17057|archivedate=22 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The current logo returns to the standing bulldog of the 1978\u20131997 logo, although it is no longer snarling.

The only exception to this was during the Second World War, when rationing meant they had to wear a maroon jersey with a blue 'V'.\n\nThere have been three basic strip designs since the club's inception in the top-flight league competition:\n* The irregular (\"butcher stripes\") stripes design which was used from 1935 until at least 1962.\n\nThis design had blue and white irregular stripes worn with black shorts.\nThe irregular strip has been used recently in occasional 'heritage' matches (e.g. Heritage round in 2008 vs St. George Illawarra)\n* The 'V Strip' \u2013 used between 1966 and 1968, and revived in 1974.\nWhite shirt with blue V, blue shorts.\nThe current \"away\" strip has blue shorts, but features a blue shirt with white V.\n* From 1969 to 1973, the club adopted a jersey featuring blue and white hoops.\nThis reverted to the 'V Strip' from 1974 onwards.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" perrow=\"5\" align=\"center\" caption=\"Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs - home jerseys\">\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1935.svg|1935\u20131942, 1947\u20131965\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1943.svg|1943\u20131946\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1969.svg|1969\u20131973\nImage:Canterbury home jersey 1966.svg|1966\u20131968, 1974\u20131996, 2013-present\nImage:Canterbury Bulldogs home jersey 1997.svg|1997\u20132012\n</gallery>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Stadium Australia 2.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]]]\nIn their inaugural season, very few home matches were allocated to the Canterbury-Bankstown club. However, when the opportunity arose the club took their matches to either [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] or [[Pratten Park]]. From the following season, the club began to base itself at [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. The club had a long-time affinity with the ground and stayed there continuously until 1994.\n[[File:Belmore Sports Ground.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Belmore Sports Ground]]]]\nIn 1995 when the [[Super League War]] began to come about, the club changed its playing name to the \"Sydney Bulldogs\" in an attempt to broaden its fan base and played matches at [[Parramatta Stadium]] where spectator facilities were of a higher class. This move paid off with the club going on to become premiers that season. However, the club reverted its name to Canterbury for the 1996 season and once again played matches out of Belmore Sports Ground; something that lasted up until the inaugural [[National Rugby League]] season of 1998.\n\n[[File:Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Interior of [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]]]]\nOnce the new [[Stadium Australia]] had been finished and opened in preparation for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]], the club began to play matches there between 1999 and 2000. From 2001 to 2005, the club then began to play matches out of the new [[Sydney Showground Stadium|Sydney Showground]] at [[Homebush Bay, New South Wales|Homebush Bay]], with bigger matches played out of the then-Telstra Stadium from 2003. When fans began to complain about the poor quality of the Showground venue as a [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league ground]], the club eventually decided to move all future home matches to the Stadium, where the club remains. In 2008, Telstra Stadium became known as ANZ Stadium due to a naming rights change.\n\nThe club's training and administration offices remained at Belmore Sports Ground until the beginning of 2008, but were relocated to Sydney Olympic Park during the 2008 season. With the NSW Government committing to upgrading Belmore Sports Ground, the club administration and training has now been returned to the historical ground after a $9 million upgrade.\n\nIn 2015, the club played two home games at their traditional home ground [[Belmore Sports Ground]] as part of the club's 80th-anniversary celebrations, and have since continued to play some games at Belmore.\n\n==Supporters==\n[[File:Belmoreoval1.jpg|thumb|Belmore Oval, Crowd at 2016 \"Return to Belmore\" match, where the Bulldogs defeated the Melbourne Storm.]]\nThe Bulldogs Army is the core [[supporter group]] for the Bulldogs, with the section they sit within known as 'The Kennel'. To be sitting in this section, supporters must become a member of the club itself and register any large flags and/or banners which are brought to the game. At all away games the Bulldogs Army locates themselves in the general admission section. The main aim of the Bulldogs Army is to show support and passion for the Bulldogs.\n\nAs the region's traditional local representatives, the Bulldogs predominantly draw on a support base in and around the districts of [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] in [[south-western Sydney]], although in recent years club administration and home matches have relocated to [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. The Bulldogs are the most supported NRL club in regional NSW\u2014over 25% of Bulldog fans are located in regional NSW, over 25% are located outside of NSW and over 10% are located in Queensland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=membership-2011 |title=Bulldogs 2011 |accessdate=2015-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020022627/http://www.bulldogs.com.au/default.aspx?s=membership-2011 |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club has one of the highest average attendances in the league: over the [[2010 NRL season|2010 season]], it was one of only two clubs to record an average home crowd of more than 20,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2010.html |title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances 2010 / Canterbury |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607084350/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2010.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe multicultural demographics of the suburbs in the club's support base, such as [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]], means the club has a large number of supporters from a range of non-Anglo ethnicities. In recent years the club has become particularly identified in the media with the [[Lebanese Australians|Lebanese]] and the [[Greek Australians|Greek]] community, particularly with the club's former star goalkicker [[Hazem El Masri]], who migrated from [[Lebanon]] as a young child. The Greek community has a huge history of Greeks playing for the club dating back to the 1970s with club legend [[George Peponis]], who migrated from [[Greece]] as a very young child who captained the Bulldogs and Australia. El Masri retired at the end of the 2009 season.\n\n=== Notable supporters ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n* [[Tahir Bilgic]], Actor, Comedian, Writer and Creator\n* [[Don

Eels===\nThe rivalry between the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Parramatta Eels is one of the fiercest in the NRL. The two clubs have been geographically close throughout their whole histories. In the 1980s, Canterbury and Parramatta both won four premierships each and met in two Grand Finals in 1984 and 1986. In the 1990s, at the height of the super league war, Parramatta signed four of Canterbury's star players [[Jarrod McCracken]], [[Dean Pay]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] which helped Parramatta reach the finals for the first time in eleven years, in the 1998 Preliminary Final, Parramatta were winning against Canterbury 18\u20132 with less than ten minutes to play when Canterbury staged one of the biggest comebacks finals comebacks defeating Parramatta 32\u201320 in extra time. In the [[2009 NRL season]], Parramatta defeated Canterbury in the preliminary final to cap off a remarkable run to the Grand Final. The crowd which attended the match was a non Grand Final record of 74,000 fans. Speaking of the rivalry in 2015, former Canterbury player [[James Graham (rugby league)|James Graham]] said \"As soon as I came to this club, I was told that they were the closest club to us and that there was no love lost between players and fans\". [[Andrew Ryan (rugby league)|Andrew Ryan]] who played for both clubs said \"Both clubs do speak about the rivalry, in the change room and leading into the clashes, they always want to get the wood on their rival, I went for Canterbury when I was a kid, but then got my first opportunity in first grade to play for Parramatta. They place a huge amount of emphasis on the game. I think I was one of the only players to go the other way, a lot of players who had played for the Bulldogs allayed first the Eels, not too many went the other way\".\n\n===Sydney Roosters===\nThe Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have a long-standing rivalry with fellow team the [[Sydney Roosters]], Whilst both teams had crossed premiership paths in Grand Finals in four occasions. In 1938, Canterbury-Bankstown won their first premiership against the Eastern Suburbs as what they were known as back then winning 19\u20136 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Two years later in 1940, the sides met again with the Easts winning the 1940 NSWRFL Grand Final 24\u201314. In 1980, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs broke a 38-year premiership drought defeating the Eastern Suburbs Roosters 18\u20134 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nIn 2002, the Sydney Roosters won the NRL Premiership on the back of a 9-game winning streak. This was the same year the premiership favourite Bulldogs were stripped of 37 points due to systematic systematic breaches of the salary cap in [[2001 NRL season|2001]] and [[2002 NRL season|2002]], in 2003, the Roosters proved themselves worthy of defending premiers title when they defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final 28\u201318 in front of a sold out Aussie Stadium. In 2004, the Roosters defeated Canterbury 35\u20130 and fighting broke out in the stands during and after the game had been completed. While the Roosters finished the regular season with the Minor Premiership, Canterbury defeated them in the Grand Final 16\u201313 after trailing 13\u20136 at half time.\n\nAs of the [[2019 NRL season]], the last time the two clubs met in a finals game was the 2015 Elimination Final which the Roosters won 38\u201312 at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n===St. George Illawarra Dragons===\nThe Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have a fierce rivalry with neighbour the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]]. Canterbury-Bankstown were founded in 1935, fourteen years after [[St. George Dragons]], St. George inflicted a premiership record 91\u20136 victory over Canterbury in 1935 but Canterbury enjoyed premiership success first in 1938 and St. George in 1942. In the [[1942 NSWRFL season]], the two clubs met in the Grand Final with Canterbury-Bankstown defeating St. George 11\u20139 in a low-scoring affair at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After that however, St. George recorded eleven straight premierships in the years following 1955\u20131966. It was also Canterbury who put an end to their Premiership run in 1967, when they beat them by a point in the preliminary final to face South Sydney in the Grand Final. Since then, both clubs inflicted Premiership defeats on the other, with the St. George Dragons defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in their last Grand Final success in 1979, the Bulldogs returned the favour in 1985.\n\nThe two teams subsequently met in the 1993 preliminary final which St. George defeated Canterbury 27\u201312. They would meet again in the 1995 and 1998 finals series with Canterbury running out winners on both occasions. The elimination final in 1998 was also St. George's last game as a stand-alone entity as the club elected to form a joint venture with [[Illawarra Steelers|Illawarra]] for the [[1999 NRL season]].\n\n==Canterbury League Club==\nThe Canterbury League Club is the licensed club of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Canterbury League Club first opened its doors for trade in September 1956 to service the needs of the football club and local community. The Salvation Army Hall became the first venue of the Canterbury League Club. Sixty people would fill the venue on a busy night.\n\nIn the first two years of trade the Club was outgrowing itself and in 1960 the Club moved its premises to Bridge St which allowed the League Club to grow as well as cater for patron parking.\n\nDuring the 1990s Canterbury managed one of the most successful league clubs in NSW and was quickly becoming known as one of the most progressive leisure facilities in Australia.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} With trade booming and patronage at an all-time high, the Club extended its trading to 24-hour trading.\n\nIn 2000, the Board had approved major renovations. The renovations started in 2000 and in 2002 the Banyan Brasserie, Dynasty Restaurant, new foyer, level 1 and health club were opened to the public.\n\nThe Club also amalgamated with Lakemba Services Memorial Club (2008) & Belfield RSL (2013).\n\nCanterbury League Club has since become one of Sydney's premier hospitality destinations with 5-star amenities including three restaurants, two coffee shops, multiple bars and entertainment lounges and a 24-hour health club.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.canterbury.com.au/history|accessdate = 15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics and records==\n{{details|List of Bulldogs records}}\n[[Hazem El Masri]] holds the NRL record for the most games played for the club, having made 317 appearances in total.\n\nHazem El Masri also holds records for the most points scored, the most tries scored and the most points scored for the Bulldogs. Since his debut in 1996, he has scored a total of 2,418 points\u2014which was also a competition record for Rugby League in Australia until 2019. Former player [[Daryl Halligan]], who retired with the club in 2000, had previously held the competition record for most points scored with 2,034, which included points scored whilst at his former club the [[North Sydney Bears]].\n\nThe club's largest win occurred in 1995 when they played as the \"Sydney Bulldogs.\" In a match against the newly formed [[North Queensland Cowboys]], the Bulldogs won 66\u20134. In the club's first season in 1935 they were subject to the two heaviest defeats in competition history two weeks in succession. Firstly, they lost to St. George 91\u20136 and the following week to Eastern Suburbs 87\u20137. However, despite these big losses, the club was able to secure their first premiership 3 years later in 1938 in the [[Grand Final]] against Eastern Suburbs; at the same time setting the record for becoming the quickest non-foundation club to win a title. This record was not broken until 1999.\n\nIn 2002, the club won 17 matches in a row after getting beaten by [[New Zealand Warriors]]; falling just two short of the record set by the Eastern Suburbs team of 1975.\n\nIn Round 7 of the 2014 season, after beating the South Sydney Rabbitohs 15\u201314, the Bulldogs became the first club to win three consecutive matches by 1 point. They went on to be runners up to South Sydney Rabbitohs in the grandfinal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2228671/canterbury-bulldogs-snatch-one-point-win-over-south-sydney-rabbitohs-photos/|title=Canterbury Bulldogs snatch one-point win over South Sydney Rabbitohs - PHOTOS|date=19 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, the Bulldogs played the Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium in front of 40,523 spectators.\n\n==Season summaries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|+ P=Premiers, R=Runner-Ups, M=Minor Premierships, F=Finals Appearance, W=Wooden Spoons <br/> (brackets represent finals games)\n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!
