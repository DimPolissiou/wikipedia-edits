The municipality is noted for its characteristic [[Norwegian dialects|dialect]].\n\nThe {{convert|1274|km2|adj=on}} municipality is the 80th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Mer\u00e5ker is the 259th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,422.

The meaning of the first element is uncertain (maybe ''merr'' which means \"[[mare]]\" or ''m\u00fdrr'' which means \"[[bog]]\" or \"[[marsh]]\") and the last element is ''akr'' which means \"[[field (agriculture)|field]]\" or \"[[acre]]\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nordre Trondhjems amt|edition=15|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W.

Traditionally, [[mining]] has played a major role in the area and has been of great economic importance for Mer\u00e5ker. Thus a silver [[minecart|mining cart]] on a red background as a symbol for the municipality was an obvious decision. The cart depicted in the arms, however, is officially described as a cart, not a mining cart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/m/meraker.htm|author=Norske Kommunev\u00e5pen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunev\u00e5bener i Norden|accessdate=8 November 2008}}</ref>\n{{See also2|The coat of arms of [[Evje og Hornnes#Coat of arms|Evje og Hornnes]]}}\n\n===Churches===\nThe [[Church of Norway]] has one parish ({{lang|no|sokn}}) within the municipality of Mer\u00e5ker.

The [[smelter]] was in operation until June 2006.  Its main product was [[microsilica]] which is used as an additive to [[cement]].\n\n==Geography==\nMer\u00e5ker is a landlocked municipality in the central part of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county.  To the north is the municipality of [[Verdal]], to the west is [[Stj\u00f8rdal]], to the south is [[Selbu]] and [[Tydal]], and to the east is [[Sweden]].\n\nThere are three major lakes in Mer\u00e5ker: [[Feren]], [[Fjergen]], and [[Funnsj\u00f8en]].  The river [[Stj\u00f8rdalselva]] runs through the municipality towards the [[Trondheimsfjord]].  The river [[Rotla]] begins in the southern part of Mer\u00e5ker.  The mountain [[Fongen]] sits on the southern border with [[Tydal]] and [[Selbu]].\n\n==Government==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Mer\u00e5ker, are responsible for [[primary education]] (through 10th grade), outpatient [[Health care|health services]], [[old age|senior citizen]] services, [[unemployment]] and other [[Social work|social services]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], and municipal [[road]]s.

It is produced in Canada, airing there on [[Teletoon]]. The remake mostly stays true to the original production, with a few key differences existing between the two.

Possessing incredible strength, bravery and a penchant for repeatedly crashing into trees while vine-swinging, George acts as the protector of all the jungle's inhabitants. He also acts immature and refers to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]]. In the second season of the series, he now has muscles to resemble his design in the original series.\n* ''Ape'' \u2013 A sarcastic and intelligent [[gorilla]] that lives with George in the jungle. He functions as George's surrogate brother, parental figure and best friend, although his attempts to educate George have a long history of repeated failures. He also tends to serve as the voice of reason most of the time. In \"George's Birthday Present\", it is revealed Ape is 5 years old in ape years. Every time he hears the sound of Mitch's bongos, he dances uncontrollably, which results in mass insanity and the destruction of their tree house. He also dances on his fingers when George uses a leaf as a [[kazoo]] as revealed in \"Ape Goes Ape\". In season 2 Ape now has a British accent to match his intelligence.\n* Ursula \u2013 A [[tomboy]]ish city girl who came to live in the jungle with George and his friends along with her father Dr. Scott. She quickly forms a bond with Magnolia, causing the two to be frequently seen together. Young, reckless and eager to introduce modern culture into the jungle, she often tries to educate her new friends to the marvels of modern city life (such as [[Christmas]] or [[Traffic light|traffic systems]]), only to usually have her attempts backfire. Regardless, she does her best to assist her friends when necessary. She is still adjusting to jungle life, and so she still has much to learn. In season 2, her name is now Magnolia and ventures the land without her father. She is hoping to win some kind of reward when her research is complete (while also hoping to making it out alive?)\n* Magnolia \u2013 A native of the jungle and [[valley girl]] figure, she is one of George's closest friends since she came to the jungle. Despite her dressing in jungle attire (such as loincloths and sticks) as well as fits of hyperactivity, she originally appeared to be very well educated in both human and jungle knowledge, often helping to bridge the gap between Ursula's city life and jungle life. She speaks with a [[Southern American accent|Southern accent]], and can appear somewhat dimwitted at times. She is the daughter of the Witch Doctor, and therefore a Witch Doctor in training (according to the episode, \"Frankengeorge\"). In season 2, her name is now Ursula and this time speaks almost like a primitive caveman and acts as George's opposite wrecking mayhem through out the jungle.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Narrator \u2013 The narrator of each George of the Jungle episode. In comparison to the narrator of the original cartoon, he speaks in a documentary-style fashion, often beginning each episode claiming \"To survive in the jungle\". often followed by a situation in complete contrast to the first impression of his introduction.\n* Dr. Scott \u2013 The modern doctor now living in the jungle with his daughter. He has formed a somewhat friendly (and often hostile) rivalry with the local Witch Doctor, continuously trying to disprove his barbaric medicine and shaman skills with modern science (often with equally unsuccessful results). In season 2 his name is now \"Dr. Chicago\" who is not a father. Sometimes he will be a Dentist or Villains, his plans will mostly be about dentistry or conquest for the jungle, but they will be easily defeated by George and his Friends.\n* Witch Doctor \u2013 A very compact, diminutive character who believes his shaman skills are the solution to all problems. He often competed with Dr. Scott and his modern medicine to see who can solve a problem first, although neither usually provides the solution to whatever problem they tackle. Reasons unknown, he is no longer on the show in season 2.\n* Big Mitch \u2013 A conniving [[golden lion tamarin|golden marmoset]] and frequent pest to the jungle community. He lives in an ancient temple full of riches and booby traps, and has a pair of bongos with him.\n* Shep \u2013  George's [[elephant]] friend who actually acts like a dog. He travels with George on most of his adventures, only rivaled by the Tookie-Tookie bird. He is very untrained, and can often be seen destroying sections of the jungle. Shep disher to play with George a lot, often playing with him when he should be helping people throughout the jungle.\n* Tookie-Tookie Bird \u2013 George's second pet, a parrot-like bird that can say his own name.\n* Howie - A [[howler monkey]] who runs a juice bar.\n\n===Others===\n* Carl \u2013  Carl is a [[baboon]] who constantly makes a fool out of George and Ape.\n* Cousin Larry \u2013 George's arrogant human cousin, who does his best to win at everything, no matter the cost. He was eventually revealed to be a cheater in all his victories and was ousted from the jungle.\n* Cousin [[Papaya]] \u2013 George and Ape\u2019s cousin, a [[King Kong]]-like gorilla that made a promise to beat the living daylights out of anyone who would mess with George or Ape and the other gorillas.\n* Edward Madmun \u2013 The creator of Madmun Island. He has an associate (and later enemy) who helped him climb to the top of [[Mount Everest]] and swim Madmun across the [[English Channel]]. George, Ape and the others often accidentally say \"Madman\" for his name, but someone always reminds them \"It's MadMUN!\".\n*[[Lion]] \u2013 A lion who was defeated by George in his childhood.\n*[[Tiger]] \u2013 A hungry predator who likes to feast on small defenseless creatures and appears randomly in cameos (as seen in \"Rainy Season\" and \"Eagle Tick\").\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Lee Tockar]] (season 1) and [[Cory Doran]] (season 2) as George, Tookie-Tookie Bird\n* [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]] (season 1) and [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]] (season 2) as a gorilla named Ape\n* [[Britt Irvin]] (season 1) and Bridget Wareham (season 2) as Ursula\n* [[Tabitha St. Germain]] (season 1) and [[Linda Ballantyne]] (season 2) as Magnolia\n* Mark Oliver as Dr. Towel Scott\n* [[Brian Drummond]] as Witch Doctor\n* [[Doron Bell]] as Big Mitch\n* [[Peter Kelamis]] as Cousin Larry\n* [[Michael Daingerfield]] (season 1) and [[Jeff Lumby]] (season 2) as Narrator\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of George of the Jungle (2007 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of George of the Jungle (2007 TV series) episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

This is unlike the original cartoon, which featured other stories such as ''[[Tom Slick (TV series)|Tom Slick]]'' and ''[[Super Chicken]]''.\n\nThe original series aired from June 29, 2007 until January 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming |url=https://archive.org/details/support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The original series premiered on [[Teletoon]] on January 11, 2009 and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States exactly a year prior.\n\nThe series returned 8 years after the original first season with a second season on September 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: The Insider |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/the-insider-3410634/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: Clockwork George |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/clockwork-george-3410635/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref> The revival season concluded on February 18, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: The Last Treehugger |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/the-last-treehugger-3445801/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: Heart of Gold |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/heart-of-gold-3445802/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle {{!}} TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-of-the-jungle/episode-51-season-2/the-last-treehugger/292169/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle {{!}} TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-of-the-jungle/episode-52-season-2/heart-of-gold/292169/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* George \u2013 A friendly, yet dim-witted, strong man in a [[loincloth]], he lives in a jungle in [[Africa]]. Possessing incredible strength, bravery and a penchant for repeatedly crashing into trees while vine-swinging, George acts as the protector of all the jungle's inhabitants. He also acts immature and refers to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]]. In the second season of the series, he now has muscles to resemble his design in the original series.\n* ''Ape'' \u2013 A sarcastic and intelligent [[gorilla]] that lives with George in the jungle. He functions as George's surrogate brother, parental figure and best friend, although his attempts to educate George have a long history of repeated failures. He also tends to serve as the voice of reason most of the time. In \"George's Birthday Present\", it is revealed Ape is 5 years old in ape years. Every time he hears the sound of Mitch's bongos, he dances uncontrollably, which results in mass insanity and the destruction of their tree house. He also dances on his fingers when George uses a leaf as a [[kazoo]] as revealed in \"Ape Goes Ape\". In season 2 Ape now has a British accent to match his intelligence.\n* Ursula \u2013 A [[tomboy]]ish city girl who came to live in the jungle with George and his friends along with her father Dr. Scott. She quickly forms a bond with Magnolia, causing the two to be frequently seen together. Young, reckless and eager to introduce modern culture into the jungle, she often tries to educate her new friends to the marvels of modern city life (such as [[Christmas]] or [[Traffic light|traffic systems]]), only to usually have her attempts backfire. Regardless, she does her best to assist her friends when necessary. She is still adjusting to jungle life, and so she still has much to learn. In season 2, her name is now Magnolia and ventures the land without her father. She is hoping to win some kind of reward when her research is complete (while also hoping to making it out alive?)\n* Magnolia \u2013 A native of the jungle and [[valley girl]] figure, she is one of George's closest friends since she came to the jungle. Despite her dressing in jungle attire (such as loincloths and sticks) as well as fits of hyperactivity, she originally appeared to be very well educated in both human and jungle knowledge, often helping to bridge the gap between Ursula's city life and jungle life. She speaks with a [[Southern American accent|Southern accent]], and can appear somewhat dimwitted at times. She is the daughter of the Witch Doctor, and therefore a Witch Doctor in training (according to the episode, \"Frankengeorge\"). In season 2, her name is now Ursula and this time speaks almost like a primitive caveman and acts as George's opposite wrecking mayhem through out the jungle.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Narrator \u2013 The narrator of each George of the Jungle episode. In comparison to the narrator of the original cartoon, he speaks in a documentary-style fashion, often beginning each episode claiming \"To survive in the jungle\". often followed by a situation in complete contrast to the first impression of his introduction.\n* Dr. Scott \u2013 The modern doctor now living in the jungle with his daughter. He has formed a somewhat friendly (and often hostile) rivalry with the local Witch Doctor, continuously trying to disprove his barbaric medicine and shaman skills with modern science (often with equally unsuccessful results). In season 2 his name is now \"Dr. Chicago\" who is not a father. Sometimes he will be a Dentist or Villains, his plans will mostly be about dentistry or conquest for the jungle, but they will be easily defeated by George and his Friends.\n* Witch Doctor \u2013 A very compact, diminutive character who believes his shaman skills are the solution to all problems. He often competed with Dr. Scott and his modern medicine to see who can solve a problem first, although neither usually provides the solution to whatever problem they tackle. Reasons unknown, he is no longer on the show in season 2.\n* Big Mitch \u2013 A conniving [[golden lion tamarin|golden marmoset]] and frequent pest to the jungle community. He lives in an ancient temple full of riches and booby traps, and has a pair of bongos with him.\n* Shep \u2013  George's [[elephant]] friend who actually acts like a dog. He travels with George on most of his adventures, only rivaled by the Tookie-Tookie bird. He is very untrained, and can often be seen destroying sections of the jungle. Shep disher to play with George a lot, often playing with him when he should be helping people throughout the jungle.\n* Tookie-Tookie Bird \u2013 George's second pet, a parrot-like bird that can say his own name.\n* Howie - A [[howler monkey]] who runs a juice bar.\n\n===Others===\n* Carl \u2013  Carl is a [[baboon]] who constantly makes a fool out of George and Ape.\n* Cousin Larry \u2013 George's arrogant human cousin, who does his best to win at everything, no matter the cost. He was eventually revealed to be a cheater in all his victories and was ousted from the jungle.\n* Cousin [[Papaya]] \u2013 George and Ape\u2019s cousin, a [[King Kong]]-like gorilla that made a promise to beat the living daylights out of anyone who would mess with George or Ape and the other gorillas.\n* Edward Madmun \u2013 The creator of Madmun Island. He has an associate (and later enemy) who helped him climb to the top of [[Mount Everest]] and swim Madmun across the [[English Channel]]. George, Ape and the others often accidentally say \"Madman\" for his name, but someone always reminds them \"It's MadMUN!\".\n*[[Lion]] \u2013 A lion who was defeated by George in his childhood.\n*[[Tiger]] \u2013 A hungry predator who likes to feast on small defenseless creatures and appears randomly in cameos (as seen in \"Rainy Season\" and \"Eagle Tick\").\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Lee Tockar]] (season 1) and [[Cory Doran]] (season 2) as George, Tookie-Tookie Bird\n* [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]] (season 1) and [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]] (season 2) as a gorilla named Ape\n* [[Britt Irvin]] (season 1) and Bridget Wareham (season 2) as Ursula\n* [[Tabitha St. Germain]] (season 1) and [[Linda Ballantyne]] (season 2) as Magnolia\n* Mark Oliver as Dr. Towel Scott\n* [[Brian Drummond]] as Witch Doctor\n* [[Doron Bell]] as Big Mitch\n* [[Peter Kelamis]] as Cousin Larry\n* [[Michael Daingerfield]] (season 1) and [[Jeff Lumby]] (season 2) as Narrator\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of George of the Jungle (2007 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of George of the Jungle (2007 TV series) episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a Birmingham based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843.

Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n==Formulation and mechanism==\nBaking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> \nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nWhen combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. \nWhether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same.

This is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today.

Primarily it is used to absorb moisture, and thus prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder's alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely. A dry powder also flows and mixes more easily. Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=534 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Before baking powder===\nWhen Amelia Simmons published ''[[American Cookery]]'' (1792), the first American cookbook, the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening: [[baker's yeast]], emptins (from the leavings of [[brewer's yeast]]), and [[pearlash]]. \nAt that time, the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood, and reliable commercial products were not available.  Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n  \nThe effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\n===Pearlash===\nThe third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nThe active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\nOnce prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Martha C. |title=Of Pearl Ash, Emptins, And Tree Sweetnin' America's First Native Cookbook |journal=American Heritage |date=1981 |volume=32 |issue=5 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/pearl-ash-emptins-and-tree-sweetnin%E2%80%99 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Stavely\">{{cite news |last1=Stavely |first1=Keith |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=Kathleen |title=What America\u2019s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-americas-first-cookbook-says-about-our-country-its-cuisine-180967809/ |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=Smithsonian magazine |date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Longone\">{{cite web |last1=Longone |first1=Jan |title=Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project By Jan Longone, Curator of American Culinary History, Clements Library, University of Michigan |url=https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/introduction |website=Clements Library, University of Michigan |accessdate=26 January 2019|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n===Experimentation===\nBetween the publication of ''American Cookery'' in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners. Many were already available in households as medicinal, cleaning or solvent products. [[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nIn 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  \nSeveral recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.

As chemists developed more uniform constituents, they also began to experiment with ways of combining them. In the mid-late 1800s, chemists introduced the first modern baking powders.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\n====Alfred Bird====\nThe first to create a form of baking powder was English chemist and food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in 1843. Bird was motivated to develop a yeast-free leavener because his wife Elizabeth was allergic to eggs and yeast. His formulation included bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid, mixed with starch to absorb moisture and prevent the other ingredients from reacting.

In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nIn 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nHorsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany. Baking powders based on Horsford's formula were sold in England as \"Horsford-Liebig Baking Powder\". They were also sold by several companies in Germany, beginning with Marquart and with Zimmer. However, baking powder was not successful in Germany at that time. Much of German baking occurred in guild-based bakeries, rather than in private homes, and the guilds were not interested in replacing centuries-old craft skills with a new technology.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|33\u201344}}<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Nonetheless, Liebig clearly saw the importance of Horsford's work, stating:\n\n{{quote|The preparation of baking powder by Professor Horsford in Cambridge in North America, I consider one of the most important and beneficial discoveries that has been made in the last decade.|[[Justus von Liebig]]<ref name=\"Jones\"/>{{rp|73}}}}\n\n====Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder====\n[[Image:X014.jpg|thumb|right|German advertisement for Dr.&nbsp;Oetker's baking powder in 1903.]]\nIn the 1890s, the German pharmacist [[August Oetker]] began to market a baking powder directly to housewives.

They incorporated there as the [[Royal Baking Powder Company]] in 1868. Various battles for control ensued between the Hoagland brothers and their one-time employee [[William Ziegler (industrialist)|William Ziegler]]. Finally, on March 2, 1899, Ziegler established the New Jersey-based Royal Baking Powder Corporation which combined the three major cream of tartar baking powder companies then in existence in the United States: Dr. Price (Ziegler), Royal (Joseph Hoagland) and Cleveland (Cornelius Nevius Hoagland).<ref name=\"Civitello\">{{cite book |last1=Civitello |first1=Linda |title=Baking powder wars : the cutthroat food fight that revolutionized cooking |date=2017 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana |isbn=978-0252041082 |pages=45, 70\u201374}}</ref>\n\n====Alum based baking powders ====\nCream of tartar was an expensive ingredient in the United States, since it had to be imported from France.  In the 1880s, several companies developed double-action baking powders containing cheaper alternative acids known as [[Alum]]s, a class of compounds involving double sulfates of aluminum.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|68}}\nThe use of various types of alum in medicines and dyes is mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History]]''.<ref name=\"pliny\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D52 |chapter=Alumen, and the several varieties of it; Thirty-eight remedies |author=Pliny the Elder |author-link=Pliny the Elder |trans-title=[[Natural History]] |title=Naturalis Historia |orig-year=77 CE |at=book&nbsp;35, chapter&nbsp;52 |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=[[Tufts University]] |access-date=27 December 2011 |language=la, en}}</ref> \nHowever, the actual composition of alum was not determined until 1798, when [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin|Louis Vauquelin]] demonstrated that common alum is a [[double salt]], composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash.<ref>Vauquelin (1797) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065209101;view=1up;seq=266 \"Sur la nature de l'Alun du commerce, sur l'existence de la potasse dans ce sel, et sur diverses combinaisons simples ou triples de l'alumine avec l'acide sulfurique\"].

Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, [[sodium aluminum sulfate]] ({{chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|\u00b712H|2|O}}) as a leavening agent, and [[albumen]].<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|83\u201385}}  In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, [[Hulman & Company|Herman Hulman]] of [[Terre Haute]] also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder  [[Clabber Girl|Clabber]], referencing a German baking tradition in which [[Clabber (food)|soured milk]] was used for leavening.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|92\u201395}}\n\n====Cream of tartar vs. alum====\nSodium aluminum sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.

They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether.  Nonetheless,\nRumford Baking Power in the United States<ref name=\"CooksCountry\"/> and Magic Baking Powder in Canada continue to produce double-acting baking powders containing  monocalcium phosphate, baking soda, and cornstarch. \nAs of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet, both of which use sodium aluminum sulfate.  Calument held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl dominating 2/3.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187\u2013188}}\n\n== How much to use ==\n[[File:BakingPowderFoaming.jpg|thumb|125px|Effective baking powder foams when placed in hot water.]]\nGenerally, one [[teaspoon]] (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to [[leavening|raise]] a mixture of one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (120&nbsp;g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder\u2014the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nHowever, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.\n\nMoisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nDifferent brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>\n\n== Substituting in recipes ==\n\n===Substitute acids===\nAs described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid.

The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a Birmingham based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843. The first double-acting baking powder was developed by [[Eben Norton Horsford]] in the United States of America in the 1860s.\n\nBaking powder is used instead of [[yeast]] for end-products where [[fermentation]] flavors would be undesirable,<ref>{{cite book | last=Matz | first=Samuel A. | title=Bakery Technology and Engineering | edition=3 | year=1992 | page=54 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=rU1wQotD3jIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>  \nwhere the batter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few minutes,<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=533 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url= https://books.google.com/?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22on+food+and+cooking%22+mcgee | accessdate=2009-08-12| isbn=9781416556374 }}</ref> and to speed the production of baked goods. Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n==Formulation and mechanism==\nBaking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> \nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nWhen combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. \nWhether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same.

Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n  \nThe effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\n===Pearlash===\nThe third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nThe active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\nOnce prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Martha C. |title=Of Pearl Ash, Emptins, And Tree Sweetnin' America's First Native Cookbook |journal=American Heritage |date=1981 |volume=32 |issue=5 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/pearl-ash-emptins-and-tree-sweetnin%E2%80%99 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Stavely\">{{cite news |last1=Stavely |first1=Keith |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=Kathleen |title=What America\u2019s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-americas-first-cookbook-says-about-our-country-its-cuisine-180967809/ |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=Smithsonian magazine |date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Longone\">{{cite web |last1=Longone |first1=Jan |title=Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project By Jan Longone, Curator of American Culinary History, Clements Library, University of Michigan |url=https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/introduction |website=Clements Library, University of Michigan |accessdate=26 January 2019|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n===Experimentation===\nBetween the publication of ''American Cookery'' in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners.

[[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nIn 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  \nSeveral recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.

In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nIn 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nHorsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\".

Finally, on March 2, 1899, Ziegler established the New Jersey-based Royal Baking Powder Corporation which combined the three major cream of tartar baking powder companies then in existence in the United States: Dr. Price (Ziegler), Royal (Joseph Hoagland) and Cleveland (Cornelius Nevius Hoagland).<ref name=\"Civitello\">{{cite book |last1=Civitello |first1=Linda |title=Baking powder wars : the cutthroat food fight that revolutionized cooking |date=2017 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=9780252041082 |page=45,70\u201374}}</ref>\n\n====Alum based baking powders ====\nCream of tartar was an expensive ingredient in the United States, since it had to be imported from France.  In the 1880s, several companies developed double-action baking powders containing cheaper alternative acids known as [[Alum]]s, a class of compounds involving double sulfates of aluminum.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|68}}\nThe use of various types of alum in medicines and dyes is mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History]]''.<ref name=\"pliny\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D52 |chapter=Alumen, and the several varieties of it; Thirty-eight remedies |author=Pliny the Elder |author-link=Pliny the Elder |trans-title=[[Natural History]] |title=Naturalis Historia |orig-year=77 CE |at=book&nbsp;35, chapter&nbsp;52 |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=[[Tufts University]] |access-date=27 December 2011 |language=la, en}}</ref> \nHowever, the actual composition of alum was not determined until 1798, when [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin|Louis Vauquelin]] demonstrated that common alum is a [[double salt]], composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash.<ref>Vauquelin (1797) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065209101;view=1up;seq=266 \"Sur la nature de l'Alun du commerce, sur l'existence de la potasse dans ce sel, et sur diverses combinaisons simples ou triples de l'alumine avec l'acide sulfurique\"].

Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, [[sodium aluminum sulfate]] ({{chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|\u00b712H|2|O}}) as a leavening agent, and [[albumen]].<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|83\u201385}}  In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, [[Hulman & Company|Herman Hulman]] of [[Terre Haute]] also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder  [[Clabber Girl|Clabber]], referencing a German baking tradition in which [[Clabber (food)|soured milk]] was used for leavening.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|92\u201395}}\n\n====Cream of tartar vs. alum====\nSodium aluminum sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.

Faced with wartime shortages of cream of tartar and baking powder, Byron H. Smith, a U.S. inventor in [[Bangor, Maine]], created substitute products for American housewives. [[Bakewell Cream]] was introduced as a replacement for cream of tartar.<ref>{{cite web |title=All About Bakewell Cream |url=https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5827-all-about-bakewell-cream |website=Cook's Illustrated |accessdate=29 January 2019|date= January 2011}}</ref> It contained [[sodium acid pyrophosphate]] and cornstarch and was labeled as a leavening agent.

A product labelled  \"Bakewell Cream\" may be either the cream of tartar substitute or the baking powder substitute depending on whether it is additionally identified as \"Double acting\" \"Baking Powder\".

They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether.  Nonetheless,\nRumford Baking Power in the United States<ref name=\"CooksCountry\"/> and Magic Baking Powder in Canada continue to produce double-acting baking powders containing  monocalcium phosphate, baking soda, and cornstarch. \nAs of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet, both of which use sodium aluminum sulfate.  Calument held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl dominating 2/3.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187\u2013188}}\n\n== How much to use ==\n[[File:BakingPowderFoaming.jpg|thumb|125px|Effective baking powder foams when placed in hot water.]]\nGenerally, one [[teaspoon]] (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to [[leavening|raise]] a mixture of one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (120&nbsp;g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder\u2014the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nHowever, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.\n\nMoisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nDifferent brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>\n\n== Substituting in recipes ==\n\n===Substitute acids===\nAs described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders. [[Vinegar]] (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common acidifier in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Chocolate Cake with Vinegar \u2013 Antique Recipe Still Very Good | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,176,151187-238193,00.html | work =Cooks.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-12 }}</ref> Where a recipe already uses [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]], baking soda can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda.

''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome.

The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.''

Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    \n\n== Economic Importance ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />.

Cuvier]], 1831\n}}\n\nThe '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    \n\n== Economic Importance ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />. However, ornate butterflyfish are nearly impossible to successfully keep in captivity because they are obligate corallivores <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n<br />\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references />\n\n# \n\n==References==\n{{Commons|Chaetodon ornatissimus}}\n* Adam, T.
