The low serum [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]], if severe enough, can be fatal.\n\n==Cause==\nAny individual who has had a negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and [[electrolyte imbalance]], especially [[hypophosphatemia]], along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.\n\nDuring [[fasting]], the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates to fat tissue [[fatty acids]] and [[amino acids]] as the main energy sources. The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving [[red blood cell]]s. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, [[insulin]] secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and [[glucagon]] secretion is increased.<ref name=pmid18583681/>\n\nDuring refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased [[blood sugar]], resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires [[phosphate]]s, [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[2,3-diphosphoglycerate]] in [[red blood cells]], leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the [[basal metabolic rate]]. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the [[blood serum|serum]] electrolytes, including [[phosphorus]] and [[magnesium]]. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B<sub>1</sub> vitamin [[thiamine]] may fall. [[Arrhythmia|Abnormal heart rhythms]] are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, [[coma]] and convulsions and [[cardiac failure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThis syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for [[anorexia nervosa]] when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be fatal.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Webb GJ, Smith K, Thursby-Pelham F, Smith T, Stroud MA, Da Silva AN |title=Complications of emergency refeeding in anorexia nervosa: case series and review |journal=Acute Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201376 |year=2011 |pmid=22041604 }}</ref> It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery. The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nRefeeding syndrome can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are required in order to make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the refeeding syndrome can occur within the first few days of refeeding.  Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period. \n\n==Treatment==\nIn critically ill patients admitted to an [[intensive care unit]], if [[phosphate]] drops to below 0.65&nbsp;mmol/L (2.0&nbsp;mg/dL) from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Doig|first=GS|last2=Simpson|first2=F|last3=Heighes|last4=Bellomo|first4=R|last5=Chesher|first5=D|last6=Caterson|first6=ID|last7=Reade|first7=MC|last8=Harrigan|first8=PWJ|date=2015-12-01|title=Restricted versus continued standard caloric intake during the management of refeeding syndrome in critically ill adults: a randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, single-blind controlled trial|journal=The Lancet Respiratory Medicine|volume=3|issue=12|pages=943\u2013952|doi=10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00418-X|issn=2213-2619|pmid=26597128}}</ref> Daily doses of [[thiamine]], [[vitamin B]] complex (strong) and a [[multivitamin|multivitamin and mineral preparation]] is strongly recommended.

She speaks of it as: \"A book of initiation into an [[eroticism]] that is at once spectacular and abysmal, but also into the emptiness of this world. A book that has fulfilled me as both a writer and a woman.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/> Cernat defines the volume as \"the inkhorn myth-making of the [[Eros (love)|eros]] and of traveling [which] relishes into an extravagant spectacle of female stances\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> Literary critic [[Dan C. Mih\u0103ilescu]] describes it as \"imbued in sexuality\", and notes that some have even compared it to ''[[Emmanuelle]]'', a French [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] film.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/>\n\nThree years after ''Tricephalos'', Cesereanu published ''Nebulon'', a collection of short stories. The eponymous micro-novel ''Nebulon'', based on the Arthurian legend, is one of many cultural references in the book: the other stories reference a wide range of cultural symbols, featuring, among other things, the imaginary symposium of [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] nations, an account involving the metamorphosis of a virgin fisherman in [[Tunisia]], a memoir of the author's own love for the British rock band [[Pink Floyd]], and recollections from her childhood.<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> Cesereanu's other Partly expanding on her earlier themes, the pieces were defined by Cernat as \"exercises in virtuosity\", and noted for their \"imaginative exuberance\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> However, the critic objected to their \"inkhorn\" and \"[[Didacticism|didactic]]\" aspects, raising concern that the author's tendency to \"reveal the conventions of her own narratives\" echoed \"pedantry\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/>\n\nEarly in the 2000s, Ruxandra Cesereanu took a more [[Experimental literature|experimental]] approach to poetry, theorizing a style for which she coined the term ''delirionism'' (from \"[[delirium]]\"). According to her own definition, it implies \"the transposition of a semi-[[Psychedelic trance|psychedelic]] [[trance]] into poetry\".<ref name=\"rolsubm\">[http://www.romanialibera.ro/a97087/submarinul-iertat.html \"''Submarinul iertat''\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103]]'', June 2, 2007</ref> She then publicized a ''Delirionist Manifesto'', which was notably read by [[Romanian American]] writer [[Andrei Codrescu]]. According to Cesereanu, Codrescu welcomed the new trend, and identified himself as a ''delirionist''.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/>\n\nIn June 2007, Cesereanu and Codrescu published a lengthy experimental poem they authored together, which was completed through the means of [[e-mail]] exchanges. Titled ''Submarinul iertat'' (\"The Forgiven Submarine\"), it is structured as a set of poetry lessons, handed down by a [[beatnik]] poet and woman pianist to a submarine.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/> Codrescu, who noted that he and his collaborator on the poem only met once in person by the time they started work, described the piece as \"the complete story of a difficult love\", commented on the writing process: \"I was a sleepwalker and an obsessive person. I wrote like a madman and expected immediate replies from Ruxandra, and if the answer did not come on time, I went into [[Hysteria|hysteric]] fits like a girl would.\"<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/>\n\nCesereanu noted that, although begun as a game, the writing drew praise from the influential Romanian writer [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]], who recommended it for publishing.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/> It was issued in a luxury edition of 150 copies, bound in velvet and illustrated with works by the Cluj-Napoca-based artist Radu Chio.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/> The two authors wrote a second collaborative poem, ''Osp\u0103\u0163ul alchimic'' (\"The Alchemic Feast\"), originally published on Cesereanu's [[blog]] and later printed by the magazine ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]''.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/>\n\n===Literary and historical essays===\nCesereanu dedicated part of her work to researching the impact of communist-organized state persecution, and to the historical investigation of [[Political prisoner|political imprisonments]] during the 1950s and 60s, as set in place by the communist secret police, the [[Securitate]]. [[Dan C. Mih\u0103ilescu]], who referred to Cesereanu as one in a \"Cluj-Napocan, [[Transylvania]]n 'trident' \" of essayists, alongside [[Marta Petreu]] and [[\u015etefan Borb\u00e9ly]], indicated she was \"one of the most industrious literary historians, analysts of mentalities, of the ethno-psychologies etc.\"<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Speaking in 2004, she noted that her contributions in the study of what she calls \"the Romanian [[Gulag]]\" aimed to provide material for a \"trial of communism\" in Romania.<ref name=\"afrc\"/> Paul Cernat argues that there may be a subtle connection between Cesereanu's fiction and her historical studies, indicating that the \"archeology of nocturnal phantasms\", a common theme in Cesereanu's poetry, may share focus with her interest in \" 'domesticating' a savage imagination\" Romanians have developed around the issue of communist terror.<ref name=\"pccolac\"/>\n\nCesereanu notes that, although not a trained historian, she sought to contribute material that would bridge a gap in traditional [[historiography]]. At the time, speaking of the prison system set in place in the [[Soviet Union]] and throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], Cesereanu stated: \"I do not think that the [[Holocaust]] and the Gulag should be judged in competition to one another, as I do not believe in a hierarchy of horror. Horror is horror, there is no room set for a first prize with a wreath and then a second place, a third etc. Between the regimes that have produced the Holocaust and those that have produced the Gulag there were differences in the practice of terror, but the goal was one and the same.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/> She also indicated that her investigations also dealt with politically motivated \"[[fratricide]]\" in general, including the [[Mineriad]]s of the early 1990s, during which miners from the [[Jiu Valley]] assailed the \"[[Golaniad|Golani]]\" crowds protesting in [[Bucharest]].<ref name=\"afrc\"/>\n\nIn particular, Cesereanu focused on preserving the memory of the Romanian penitentiary system, objecting to a tendency toward \"passivity and indifference\", which, she argues, is present among those who have \"collaborated with the communist regime\" or are among \"the more or less symbolic executioners\".<ref name=\"afrc\"/> She also noted that, in addition to this category and the smaller one, comprising people who assume \"a collective memory\", there are those who assume a \"neither pro- nor against position, because they have done nothing against the communist regime, but where obedient.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/> She added: \"I place my confidence in the youngsters and their appetite for the truth.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/>\n\nCesereanu's research into violence also extended to investigating the tradition of abusive and demeaning language in Romanian journalistic prose, from the 19th century onwards. She subsequently published the 2003 study ''Imaginarul violent al rom\u00e2nilor'' (\"The Violent Imaginary of the Romanians\"), which analyzes the references to violence in articles authored by the celebrated writers [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]], provides an overview of the violent [[Fascism|fascist]] discourse of the [[interwar period]] and [[World War II]] (in particular that used by the [[Iron Guard]]), and looks into the radicalism of the communist newspapers which monopolized information after 1947.<ref name=\"pccolac\"/><ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/><ref name=\"amromvio\"/> The main focus, Cesereanu writes in the book, was on the \"spectacular-inventive\" use of \"the law breaking register, the bestial, the putrid-excremental and the lecherous ones.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/> According to [[Adrian Marino]], this signified that the material dealt with was of a \"maximal triviality, vulgarity and violence.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/>\n\nIn its final part, the volume investigates the proliferation of abusive language and threats in the Romanian press of the early 1990s, focusing on papers who supported the ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], in particular ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', ''[[Diminea\u0163a]]'', ''[[Azi (Romanian newspaper)|Azi]]'' and the ultra-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Mare (magazine)|Rom\u00e2nia Mare]]''.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Notably, this chapter of the book focuses on [[hate mail]] received by poet [[Ana Blandiana]], who had become one of the Salvation Front's most prominent critics, and who, Doina Jela argues, was thus being subjected to intimidation from the part of former Securitate operatives who supported the new authorities.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Also according to Jela, Cesereanu read the letters in their entirety (something which their addressee had always refused to do) and used their many claims and calumnies as evidence of a distorted and violent image Romanians in general had of the world at large.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Of the book's perspective on the Mineriads, Marino wrote: \"Written in sobre, calm manner, with outstanding clarity, well-informed, this 'bitter story' (which we have all lived through) [is] at the level of the best Romanian contributions in this field. And more than once above these.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/> Noting the impact of \"the author's literary talent\" on her scientific work, he praised the work for its \"fluent style, without any aridity.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/>\n\nAlthough critically acclaimed, the book raised some concerns that, in particular through its choice of title, it was over-generalizing mentalities not necessarily shared by the entire Romanian society.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> While himself objecting to this possibility of misinterpretation, Mih\u0103ilescu notes that ''Imaginarul violent al rom\u00e2nilor'' documents a number of unusual connections between violent images in the Romanian press. He thus comments that the \"imprecations\" found in the [[far right]] ''[[Sfarm\u0103-Piatr\u0103]]'' resemble the \"appeals to assassination\" authored by the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s [[Silviu Brucan]], and that some of the more scornful pamphlets published by the [[left-wing]] Arghezi served as an inspiration to the ultra-nationalists [[Eugen Barbu]] and [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]].<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Adrian Marino commented that, although the book could not provide an exact portrayal of Romanian references to violence, it could serve as a study in \"ethno-[[onthology]]\", a concept first used by Romanian historian [[Sorin Antohi]].<ref name=\"amromvio\"/> Cesereanu herself commented on her choice of title, indicating that she had aimed for \"corporalization and personalization\", and rejecting speculation that she was unfavorably comparing Romanians to other peoples.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/>\n\nCesereanu also coordinated two volumes documenting the livelihood of marginalized categories in the post-revolutionary period. According to Cernat, they are both written as \"experimental [[reportage]]s\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> She has also contributed a book on the 1989 Romanian Revolution (''Decembrie '89. Deconstruc\u0163ia unei revolu\u0163ii'', \"December 1989. The Deconstruction of a Revolution\").<ref name=\"pccolac\"/>\n\n==Political advocacy==\nIn early 2007, Cesereanu became involved in supporting [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian B\u0103sescu]], who was facing [[2007 Romanian presidential impeachment referendum|impeachment referendum]] as a result of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] decision. Together with 49 other intellectuals (among them [[Adriana Babe\u0163i]], [[Hannelore Baier]], [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]], [[Magda C\u00e2rneci]], [[Livius Cioc\u00e2rlie]], [[Andrei Cornea]], [[Sabina Fati]], [[Florin Gabrea]], [[Sorin Ilie\u015fiu]], [[Gabriel Liiceanu]], [[Mircea Mih\u0103ie\u015f]], [[Dan C.

They are believed by several commentators to have been influenced by [[Surrealism]] and its Romanian successor, [[Onirism]], and seen as examples of [[Postmodern literature|Postmodernism]], while Cesereanu herself identified some of her writings with [[psychedelic experience]] and with the coined term ''delirionism''. She is also noted for collaborating with Romanian-born American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] on two poems, both of which were completed through [[e-mail]] exchanges.\n\nSeveral of Cesereanu's studies deal with the impact of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] on [[Romanian culture]] and society, and in particular with the history of repression and [[penal labor]]. She has also contributed essays and coordinated research on various aspects of Romania's [[History of Romania since 1989|post-communist history]], as well as on the history of journalism in her country.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in Cluj-Napoca, Ruxandra Cesereanu is the daughter of writer Dome\u0163ian Teodoziu Cesereanu and his wife Aurora, a teacher.

She speaks of it as: \"A book of initiation into an [[eroticism]] that is at once spectacular and abysmal, but also into the emptiness of this world. A book that has fulfilled me as both a writer and a woman.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/> Cernat defines the volume as \"the inkhorn myth-making of the [[Eros (love)|eros]] and of traveling [which] relishes into an extravagant spectacle of female stances\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> Literary critic [[Dan C. Mih\u0103ilescu]] describes it as \"imbued in sexuality\", and notes that some have even compared it to ''[[Emmanuelle]]'', a French [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] film.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/>\n\nThree years after ''Tricephalos'', Cesereanu published ''Nebulon'', a collection of short stories. The eponymous micro-novel ''Nebulon'', based on the Arthurian legend, is one of many cultural references in the book: the other stories reference a wide range of cultural symbols, featuring, among other things, the imaginary symposium of [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] nations, an account involving the metamorphosis of a virgin fisherman in [[Tunisia]], a memoir of the author's own love for the British rock band [[Pink Floyd]], and recollections from her childhood.<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> Cesereanu's other Partly expanding on her earlier themes, the pieces were defined by Cernat as \"exercises in virtuosity\", and noted for their \"imaginative exuberance\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> However, the critic objected to their \"inkhorn\" and \"[[Didacticism|didactic]]\" aspects, raising concern that the author's tendency to \"reveal the conventions of her own narratives\" echoed \"pedantry\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/>\n\nEarly in the 2000s, Ruxandra Cesereanu took a more [[Experimental literature|experimental]] approach to poetry, theorizing a style for which she coined the term ''delirionism'' (from \"[[delirium]]\"). According to her own definition, it implies \"the transposition of a semi-[[Psychedelic trance|psychedelic]] [[trance]] into poetry\".<ref name=\"rolsubm\">[http://www.romanialibera.ro/a97087/submarinul-iertat.html \"''Submarinul iertat''\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103]]'', June 2, 2007</ref> She then publicized a ''Delirionist Manifesto'', which was notably read by [[Romanian American]] writer [[Andrei Codrescu]]. According to Cesereanu, Codrescu welcomed the new trend, and identified himself as a ''delirionist''.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/>\n\nIn June 2007, Cesereanu and Codrescu published a lengthy experimental poem they authored together, which was completed through the means of [[e-mail]] exchanges. Titled ''Submarinul iertat'' (\"The Forgiven Submarine\"), it is structured as a set of poetry lessons, handed down by a [[beatnik]] poet and woman pianist to a submarine.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/> Codrescu, who noted that he and his collaborator on the poem only met once in person by the time they started work, described the piece as \"the complete story of a difficult love\", commented on the writing process: \"I was a sleepwalker and an obsessive person. I wrote like a madman and expected immediate replies from Ruxandra, and if the answer did not come on time, I went into [[Hysteria|hysteric]] fits like a girl would.\"<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/>\n\nCesereanu noted that, although begun as a game, the writing drew praise from the influential Romanian writer [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]], who recommended it for publishing.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/> It was issued in a luxury edition of 150 copies, bound in velvet and illustrated with works by the Cluj-Napoca-based artist Radu Chio.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/> The two authors wrote a second collaborative poem, ''Osp\u0103\u0163ul alchimic'' (\"The Alchemic Feast\"), originally published on Cesereanu's [[blog]] and later printed by the magazine ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]''.<ref name=\"rolsubm\"/>\n\n===Literary and historical essays===\nCesereanu dedicated part of her work to researching the impact of communist-organized state persecution, and to the historical investigation of [[Political prisoner|political imprisonments]] during the 1950s and 60s, as set in place by the communist secret police, the [[Securitate]]. [[Dan C. Mih\u0103ilescu]], who referred to Cesereanu as one in a \"Cluj-Napocan, [[Transylvania]]n 'trident' \" of essayists, alongside [[Marta Petreu]] and [[\u015etefan Borb\u00e9ly]], indicated she was \"one of the most industrious literary historians, analysts of mentalities, of the ethno-psychologies etc.\"<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Speaking in 2004, she noted that her contributions in the study of what she calls \"the Romanian [[Gulag]]\" aimed to provide material for a \"trial of communism\" in Romania.<ref name=\"afrc\"/> Paul Cernat argues that there may be a subtle connection between Cesereanu's fiction and her historical studies, indicating that the \"archeology of nocturnal phantasms\", a common theme in Cesereanu's poetry, may share focus with her interest in \" 'domesticating' a savage imagination\" Romanians have developed around the issue of communist terror.<ref name=\"pccolac\"/>\n\nCesereanu notes that, although not a trained historian, she sought to contribute material that would bridge a gap in traditional [[historiography]]. At the time, speaking of the prison system set in place in the [[Soviet Union]] and throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], Cesereanu stated: \"I do not think that the [[Holocaust]] and the Gulag should be judged in competition to one another, as I do not believe in a hierarchy of horror. Horror is horror, there is no room set for a first prize with a wreath and then a second place, a third etc. Between the regimes that have produced the Holocaust and those that have produced the Gulag there were differences in the practice of terror, but the goal was one and the same.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/> She also indicated that her investigations also dealt with politically motivated \"[[fratricide]]\" in general, including the [[Mineriad]]s of the early 1990s, during which miners from the [[Jiu Valley]] assailed the \"[[Golaniad|Golani]]\" crowds protesting in [[Bucharest]].<ref name=\"afrc\"/>\n\nIn particular, Cesereanu focused on preserving the memory of the Romanian penitentiary system, objecting to a tendency toward \"passivity and indifference\", which, she argues, is present among those who have \"collaborated with the communist regime\" or are among \"the more or less symbolic executioners\".<ref name=\"afrc\"/> She also noted that, in addition to this category and the smaller one, comprising people who assume \"a collective memory\", there are those who assume a \"neither pro- nor against position, because they have done nothing against the communist regime, but where obedient.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/> She added: \"I place my confidence in the youngsters and their appetite for the truth.\"<ref name=\"afrc\"/>\n\nCesereanu's research into violence also extended to investigating the tradition of abusive and demeaning language in Romanian journalistic prose, from the 19th century onwards. She subsequently published the 2003 study ''Imaginarul violent al rom\u00e2nilor'' (\"The Violent Imaginary of the Romanians\"), which analyzes the references to violence in articles authored by the celebrated writers [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]], provides an overview of the violent [[Fascism|fascist]] discourse of the [[interwar period]] and [[World War II]] (in particular that used by the [[Iron Guard]]), and looks into the radicalism of the communist newspapers which monopolized information after 1947.<ref name=\"pccolac\"/><ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/><ref name=\"amromvio\"/> The main focus, Cesereanu writes in the book, was on the \"spectacular-inventive\" use of \"the law breaking register, the bestial, the putrid-excremental and the lecherous ones.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/> According to [[Adrian Marino]], this signified that the material dealt with was of a \"maximal triviality, vulgarity and violence.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/>\n\nIn its final part, the volume investigates the proliferation of abusive language and threats in the Romanian press of the early 1990s, focusing on papers who supported the ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], in particular ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', ''[[Diminea\u0163a]]'', ''[[Azi (Romanian newspaper)|Azi]]'' and the ultra-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Mare (magazine)|Rom\u00e2nia Mare]]''.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Notably, this chapter of the book focuses on [[hate mail]] received by poet [[Ana Blandiana]], who had become one of the Salvation Front's most prominent critics, and who, Doina Jela argues, was thus being subjected to intimidation from the part of former Securitate operatives who supported the new authorities.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Also according to Jela, Cesereanu read the letters in their entirety (something which their addressee had always refused to do) and used their many claims and calumnies as evidence of a distorted and violent image Romanians in general had of the world at large.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Of the book's perspective on the Mineriads, Marino wrote: \"Written in sobre, calm manner, with outstanding clarity, well-informed, this 'bitter story' (which we have all lived through) [is] at the level of the best Romanian contributions in this field. And more than once above these.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/> Noting the impact of \"the author's literary talent\" on her scientific work, he praised the work for its \"fluent style, without any aridity.\"<ref name=\"amromvio\"/>\n\nAlthough critically acclaimed, the book raised some concerns that, in particular through its choice of title, it was over-generalizing mentalities not necessarily shared by the entire Romanian society.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> While himself objecting to this possibility of misinterpretation, Mih\u0103ilescu notes that ''Imaginarul violent al rom\u00e2nilor'' documents a number of unusual connections between violent images in the Romanian press. He thus comments that the \"imprecations\" found in the [[far right]] ''[[Sfarm\u0103-Piatr\u0103]]'' resemble the \"appeals to assassination\" authored by the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s [[Silviu Brucan]], and that some of the more scornful pamphlets published by the [[left-wing]] Arghezi served as an inspiration to the ultra-nationalists [[Eugen Barbu]] and [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]].<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/> Adrian Marino commented that, although the book could not provide an exact portrayal of Romanian references to violence, it could serve as a study in \"ethno-[[onthology]]\", a concept first used by Romanian historian [[Sorin Antohi]].<ref name=\"amromvio\"/> Cesereanu herself commented on her choice of title, indicating that she had aimed for \"corporalization and personalization\", and rejecting speculation that she was unfavorably comparing Romanians to other peoples.<ref name=\"rbimgvio\"/>\n\nCesereanu also coordinated two volumes documenting the livelihood of marginalized categories in the post-revolutionary period. According to Cernat, they are both written as \"experimental [[reportage]]s\".<ref name=\"pccolac\"/> She has also contributed a book on the 1989 Romanian Revolution (''Decembrie '89. Deconstruc\u0163ia unei revolu\u0163ii'', \"December 1989. The Deconstruction of a Revolution\").<ref name=\"pccolac\"/>\n\n==Political advocacy==\nIn early 2007, Cesereanu became involved in supporting [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian B\u0103sescu]], who was facing [[2007 Romanian presidential impeachment referendum|impeachment referendum]] as a result of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] decision. Together with 49 other intellectuals (among them [[Adriana Babe\u0163i]], [[Hannelore Baier]], [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]], [[Magda C\u00e2rneci]], [[Livius Cioc\u00e2rlie]], [[Andrei Cornea]], [[Sabina Fati]], [[Florin Gabrea]], [[Sorin Ilie\u015fiu]], [[Gabriel Liiceanu]], [[Mircea Mih\u0103ie\u015f]], [[Dan C.

The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections.<ref name=\"WebbDJ\"/> Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).\n\nSildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4(major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose).  If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.<ref name=RxListCP>{{cite web| url = http://www.rxlist.com/viagra-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm | title = Viagra Clinical Pharmacology | year = 2008 | accessdate = 20 August 2008 | publisher = RxList.com}}</ref>\n\n==Route of administration==\n* When taken [[Oral administration|by mouth]] sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eardley I, Ellis P, Boolell M, Wulff M |title=Onset and duration of action of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=53 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=61S\u201365S |year=2002 |pmid=11879261 |pmc=1874251 |doi= 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.00034.x|url=}}</ref>\n* [[Sublingual administration|Under the tongue]] use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting for an average of 40 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deveci S, Pe\u015fkircio\u011flu L, Ayg\u00fcn C, Tekin MI, Dirim A, Ozkarde\u015f H |title=Sublingual sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction: faster onset of action with less dose |journal=Int.

[[Nitric oxide]] (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to [[guanylate cyclase]] receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to [[smooth muscle]] relaxation ([[vasodilation]]) of the intimal cushions of the [[Helicine arteries of penis|helicine arteries]]. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection.<ref name=\"WebbDJ\">{{cite journal|author1=Webb, D.J. |author2=Freestone, S. |author3=Allen, M.J. |author4=Muirhead, G.J. |title=Sildenafil citrate and blood-pressure-lowering drugs: results of drug interaction studies with an organic nitrate and a calcium antagonist|date=4 March 1999|journal=Am.

The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections.<ref name=\"WebbDJ\"/> Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).\n\nSildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4(major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose).  If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.<ref name=RxListCP>{{cite web| url = http://www.rxlist.com/viagra-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm | title = Viagra Clinical Pharmacology | year = 2008 | accessdate = 20 August 2008 | publisher = RxList.com}}</ref>\n\n==Route of administration==\n* When taken [[Oral administration|by mouth]] sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eardley I, Ellis P, Boolell M, Wulff M |title=Onset and duration of action of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=53 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=61S\u201365S |year=2002 |pmid=11879261 |pmc=1874251 |doi= 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.00034.x|url=}}</ref>\n* [[Sublingual administration|Under the tongue]] use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting for an average of 40 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deveci S, Pe\u015fkircio\u011flu L, Ayg\u00fcn C, Tekin MI, Dirim A, Ozkarde\u015f H |title=Sublingual sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction: faster onset of action with less dose |journal=Int.
