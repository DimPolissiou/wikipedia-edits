Super League Greece] \n}}\n\n==Play-offs==\nIn the play-off for Champions League, the teams play each other in a home and away [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]]. However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league.

However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five to give the other teams the points with which they start the mini-league.\n\nThe teams started the play-offs with the following number of points:\n* Olympiacos \u2013 4 points ''((64\u201346) / 5 = 3.6, rounded up to 4)''\n* P.A.O.K. \u2013 3 points ''((62\u201346) / 5 = 3.2, rounded to 3)''\n* AEK Athens \u2013 1 point ''((53\u201346) / 5 = 1.4, rounded to 1)''\n* Aris \u2013 0 points ''((46\u201346) / 5 = 0)''\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|section = Play-offs\n|show_limit = 5\n|res_col_header=Q\n\n|highest_pos=2\n\n|team2=PAOK|team3=AEK|team4=ARI|team5=OLY\n\n<!--\nadjust_points parameter denotes starting points for the first three teams\n-->\n\n|win_PAOK=4|draw_PAOK=1|loss_PAOK=1|gf_PAOK=7|ga_PAOK=3|adjust_points_PAOK=3\n|win_AEK=2|draw_AEK=2|loss_AEK=2|gf_AEK=8|ga_AEK=7|adjust_points_AEK=1\n|win_ARI=2|draw_ARI=2|loss_ARI=2|gf_ARI=8|ga_ARI=9\n|win_OLY=1|draw_OLY=1|loss_OLY=4|gf_OLY=3|ga_OLY=7|adjust_points_OLY=4\n|hth_ARI=Head-to-head record: Aris\u2013Olympiacos 2\u20130, Olympiacos\u2013Aris 0\u20130.\n|hth_OLY=ARI\n|col_CL3=green2|text_CL3=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]]\n|result2=CL3\n|col_ELPR=blue1|text_ELPR=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League#Play-off round|Europa League play-off round]]\n|note_res_ELPR=EL3\n|result3=ELPR\n|col_EL3=blue2|text_EL3=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League#Third qualifying round|Europa League third qualifying round]]\n|note_res_EL3=Since Aris lost the [[2009\u201310 Greek Football Cup]] Final against Champions League-qualified [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], all Europa League spots will be determined by the play-off group positions.\n|result4=EL3\n|col_EL2=blue3|text_EL2=Qualification for [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|Europa League second qualifying round]]\n|note_res_EL2=EL3\n|result5=EL2\n\n|class_rules=1) points;

Some of the wheels are 3 meters wide. Only six of the seven horse still stand today.<ref>''It is a monumental representation of the chariot of Surya pulled by a team of seven horses (six of which still exist and are placed on either side of the stairway leading to the sanctuary).'' {{harvnb|UNESCO|1984}}</ref> The temple fell into disuse after an envoy of [[Jahangir]] desecrated the temple in the early 17th century.<ref>''The temple fell into disuse in the early 17th century after it was desecrated by an envoy of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir.'' {{harvnb|UNESCO|1984}}</ref>\n\nAccording to folklore, there was a diamond in the centre of the idol which reflected the sun rays that passed. In 1627, the then Raja of Khurda took the Sun idol from Konark to the Jagannath temple in Puri. The Sun temple belongs to the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]n school of Indian temple architecture. The alignment of the Sun Temple is along the east\u2013west direction. The inner sanctum or ''vimana'' used to be surmounted by a tower or ''shikara'' but it was razed in the 19th century. The audience hall or ''jagamohana'' still stands and comprises majority of the ruins. The roof of the dance hall or ''natmandir'' has fallen off. It stands at the eastern end of the ruins on a raised platform.<ref>''Further to the east, the natmandir (dance hall), today unroofed, rises on a high platform.'' {{harvnb|UNESCO|1984}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1559, Mukunda Gajapati came to throne in [[Cuttack]]. He aligned himself as an ally of [[Akbar]] and an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal, [[Sulaiman Khan Karrani]]. After a few battles, Odisha finally fell. The fall was also aided by the internal turmoil of the state. In 1568, the Konark temple was damaged by the army of [[Kalapahad]], a general of the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patnaik|first=Durga Prasad|title=Palm Leaf Etchings of Odisha|year=1989|publisher=Abhinav Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90_qAeMT1bwC&lpg=PA49&vq=Konark&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=25 October 2012|page=4}}</ref> Kalapahad is also said to be responsible for damages to several other temples during the conquest.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Konark had a population of 16,779.

Some of the wheels are 3 meters wide. Only six of the seven horse still stand today.<ref>''It is a monumental representation of the chariot of Surya pulled by a team of seven horses (six of which still exist and are placed on either side of the stairway leading to the sanctuary).'' {{harvnb|UNESCO|1984}}</ref> The temple fell into disuse after an envoy of [[Jahangir]] desecrated the temple in the early 17th century.<ref>''The temple fell into disuse in the early 17th century after it was desecrated by an envoy of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir.'' {{harvnb|UNESCO|1984}}</ref> \n\n\nAccording to folklore, there was a diamond in the centre of the idol which reflected the sun rays that passed. In 1627, the then Raja of Khurda took the Sun idol from Konark to the Jagannath temple in Puri. The Sun temple belongs to the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]n school of Indian temple architecture. The alignment of the Sun Temple is along the East-West direction. The inner sanctum or ''vimana'' used to be surmounted by a tower or ''shikara'' but it was razed in the 19th century. The audience hall or ''jagamohana'' still stands and comprises majority of the ruins. The roof of the dance hall or ''natmandir'' has fallen off. It stands at the eastern end of the ruins on a raised platform.<ref>''Further to the east, the natmandir (dance hall), today unroofed, rises on a high platform.'' {{harvnb|UNESCO|1984}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1559, Mukunda Gajapati came to throne in [[Cuttack]]. He aligned himself as an ally of [[Akbar]] and an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal, [[Sulaiman Khan Karrani]]. After a few battles, Odisha finally fell. The fall was also aided by the internal turmoil of the state. In 1568, the Konark temple was damaged by the army of [[Kalapahad]], a general of the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patnaik|first=Durga Prasad|title=Palm Leaf Etchings of Odisha|year=1989|publisher=Abhinav Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90_qAeMT1bwC&lpg=PA49&vq=Konark&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=25 October 2012|page=4}}</ref> Kalapahad is also said to be responsible for damages to several other temples during the conquest.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Konark had a population of 16,779.

was conceived by 17 [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the [[Midwest]]. Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S.

The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

was conceived by 17 [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the [[Midwest]]. Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]].

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

Opened on April 5, 2019, the Shed commissions, produces, and presents a wide range of activities in performing arts, visual arts, and pop culture.\n\nThe Shed is located in the '''Bloomberg Building''', adjacent to the northern leg of the [[High Line]] elevated park, near the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] gallery district. It is attached to [[15 Hudson Yards]], a skyscraper within the [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards]] real estate development, although the Shed itself is located on city-owned land. The cultural center is maintained by an independent [[nonprofit]] cultural organization of the same name. The CEO/Artistic Director for the Shed is [[Alex Poots]]. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is [[Daniel L. Doctoroff|Daniel Doctoroff]].\n\nConstruction on the Shed started in 2015, using a design from lead architect [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] and collaborating architect [[Rockwell Group]]. Structural engineering, the [[facade]], and kinetic design was provided by [[Thornton Tomasetti]]. Hardesty & Hanover was the mechanization consultant. The Shed features several architectural features, including a retractable shell that creates a space, named The McCourt, for large-scale performances, installations and events; a 500-seat theater; and two levels of exhibition space. The plans for the cultural center have drawn praise from numerous media outlets and art institutions. It was initially criticized by the surrounding community, but as construction progressed, media reviews of the Shed have leaned more positive.\n\n==History==\n\n===Rezoning===\nIn January 2005, the [[New York City Council]] approved the rezoning of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets;<ref>{{cite news |title=What Rises in the West?

Opened on April 5, 2019, the Shed commissions, produces, and presents a wide range of activities in performing arts, visual arts, and pop culture.\n\nThe Shed is located in the '''Bloomberg Building''', adjacent to the northern leg of the [[High Line]] elevated park, near the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] gallery district. It is attached to [[15 Hudson Yards]], a skyscraper within the [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards]] real estate development, although the Shed itself is located on city-owned land. The cultural center is maintained by an independent [[nonprofit]] cultural organization of the same name. The CEO/Artistic Director for the Shed is [[Alex Poots]]. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is [[Daniel L. Doctoroff|Daniel Doctoroff]].\n\nConstruction on the Shed started in 2015, using a design from lead architect [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] and collaborating architect [[Rockwell Group]]. Structural engineering, the [[facade]], and kinetic design was provided by [[Thornton Tomasetti]]. Hardesty & Hanover was the mechanization consultant. The Shed features several architectural features, including a retractable shell that creates a space, named The McCourt, for large-scale performances, installations and events; a 500-seat theater; and two levels of exhibition space. The plans for the cultural center have drawn praise from numerous media outlets and art institutions.
