The oldest 100,000-crowd concert reported to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore is [[Grateful Dead]]'s gig at the [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park|Raceway Park]], [[Englishtown, New Jersey]] on September 3, 1977. The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Paul McCartney]] broke the record respectively in [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, GLAY, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 6 years. Italian singer [[Vasco Rossi]] surpassed McCartney's record with his solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of his 40 years of career. Robbie Williams played to an audience of 135,000 in Phoenix Park, Dublin in Aug 2003. \n\nAlthough the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more. According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Rod Stewart]]'s show in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], Rio de Janeiro, remains the highest-attended free concert with an estimated 3.5 million audience.\n\n==Highest-attended concerts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FAEB86\"|{{*|alt=Indicates the concert was the all-time highest attended up to that point}}\n|Indicates the concert was the highest-attended of all time up to that point\n|}\n\n===Single-artist concerts===\nThe following are the highest-attended single-artist's ticketed concerts (excluding [[music festival]]s) with attendance of 100,000 people or more.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=100%\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Artist\n!align=left| Venue\n!

The oldest 100,000-crowd concert reported to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore is [[Grateful Dead]]'s gig at the [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park|Raceway Park]], [[Englishtown, New Jersey]] on September 3, 1977. The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Paul McCartney]] broke the record respectively in [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, GLAY, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 17 years. Italian singer [[Vasco Rossi]] surpassed McCartney's record with his solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of his 40 years of career. Robbie Williams played to an audience of 135,000 in Phoenix Park, Dublin in Aug 2003. \n\nAlthough the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more. According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Rod Stewart]]'s show in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], Rio de Janeiro, remains the highest-attended free concert with an estimated 3.5 million audience.\n\n==Highest-attended concerts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FAEB86\"|{{*|alt=Indicates the concert was the all-time highest attended up to that point}}\n|Indicates the concert was the highest-attended of all time up to that point\n|}\n\n===Single-artist concerts===\nThe following are the highest-attended single-artist's ticketed concerts (excluding [[music festival]]s) with attendance of 100,000 people or more.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=100%\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Artist\n!align=left| Venue\n!

A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for [[sexual intercourse]] and continue during it. [[#Male physiological response|Male arousal]] will lead to an [[erection]], and in [[#Female physiological response|female arousal]] the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as [[Erection of nipples|nipples]], [[vulva]], [[Clitoral erection|clitoris]], [[Vagina#Sexual activity|vaginal wall]]s and [[vaginal lubrication]]. [[Stimulus (psychology)|Mental stimuli]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimuli]] such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of [[hormones]], can influence sexual arousal.\n\nSexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient [[sexual stimulation]], sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an [[orgasm]]. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an\n\n==Terminology==\nThere are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including ''horny'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horny |title=horny - definition of horny by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> ''turned on'', ''randy'', ''steamy'', and ''lustful''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synonyms.net/synonym/aroused |title=aroused synonym. |publisher=Synonyms.net |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called '''erotic stimuli''' and colloquially known as '''turn-ons'''.\n\n==Erotic stimuli==\n{{Main|Sexual stimulation|Erogenous zone}}\n\nDepending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an [[erogenous zone]] or acts of [[foreplay]] can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a [[romance (love)|romantic]] setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal.\n\nStimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: [[somatosensory]] (touch), visual, and [[olfactory]] (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including [[kiss]]ing, [[hug|cuddling]], and [[petting]] of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the [[breast]]s, [[nipple]]s, [[buttocks]] and/or [[Sex organ|genitals]], and further [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].\n\nErotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find [[nudity]], [[erotica]] or [[pornography]] sexually arousing.<ref>DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \"[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200512/lust-the-long-haul Lust For The Long Haul]\". [[Psychology Today]]. 2008-12-26</ref> This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as [[sexual fetishism]], or in some instances a [[paraphilia]].\n\nThere is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal]] (in Canada) used the method of [[thermal]] imaging to record baseline [[temperature]] change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal&nbsp;\u2014 around 10 minutes.<ref name=intro/> The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html|title=Your introduction to foreplay|accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618222527/http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other animals, [[human]]s do not have a [[mating season]], and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year.\n\n==Disorders==\n{{see also|Sexual arousal disorder|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Female sexual arousal disorder}}\n\nSexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are [[sexually inhibited]]. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person.\n\nHowever, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a [[sexual arousal disorder]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]]. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, a person may be [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a [[persistent genital arousal disorder]], which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal.\n\n== Physiological and psychological response patterns ==\n=== Physiological responses ===\n\nSexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the [[sex organ]]s (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the [[tumescence|swelling]] and [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] when blood fills the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the [[clitoris]] and [[vulva]], as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%\"|\nIn males:\n!In females:\n|-\n|[[File:Comparison of flaccid and erect penis.jpg|thumb]]<br /><small>Male sexual arousal.

Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to [[vasodilation]] and the increased blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run along the length of the penis (the two [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] and the [[corpus spongiosum]]). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the [[scrotum]] is pulled tighter, and the [[testes]] are pulled up against the body.<ref name=\"NHS\">{{cite web|title=Sexual arousal in men|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodsex/Pages/Malesexualarousal.aspx|work=NHS Direct|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one. After their mid-forties, some men report that they do not always have an erection when they are sexually aroused.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Erick |author2=Kimberly R.

A young man&nbsp;\u2014 or one with a strong libido&nbsp;\u2014 may experience enough sexual arousal for an erection to result from a passing thought, or just the sight of a passerby. Once erect, his penis may gain enough stimulation from contact with the inside of his clothing to maintain and encourage it for some time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embarrassing erections|url=http://www.thesite.org/sex-and-relationships/masturbation/embarrassing-erections-3357.html|work=TheSite.org|publisher=YouthNet UK|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs sexual arousal and stimulation continues, it is likely that the [[Glans penis|glans]] or head of the erect penis will swell wider and, as the genitals become further engorged with blood, their color deepens and the testicles can grow up to 50% larger. As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the [[perineum]]. With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and breathing becomes quicker.<ref name=\"NHS\"/> The increase in blood flow in the genital and other regions may lead to a [[sex flush]] sometimes, in some men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennard|first=Jerry|title=Sexual Arousal|url=http://menshealth.about.com/od/sexualhealth/a/sexual_arousal.htm|work=Men's health|publisher=About.com|year=2006|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>\n\nAs sexual stimulation continues, [[orgasm]] begins, when the muscles of the [[pelvic floor]], the [[vas deferens]] (between the testicles and the prostate), the [[seminal vesicle]]s and the [[prostate]] gland itself may begin to contract in a way that forces sperm and semen into the [[urethra]] inside the penis. Once this has started, it is likely that the man will continue to [[ejaculate]] and orgasm fully, with or without further stimulation.\n\nEqually, if sexual stimulation stops before orgasm, the physical effects of the stimulation, including the [[vasocongestion]], will subside in a short time. Repeated or prolonged stimulation without orgasm and ejaculation can lead to discomfort in the testes (corresponding to the slang term \"[[blue balls]]\"<ref>Weinzimer, S.A. & Thorton, P.S., \"Blue balls\", \" ''Pediatrics'' 108(5), 1233-1234\", 2001</ref>).\n\nAfter orgasm and ejaculation, men usually experience a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] characterised by loss of erection, a subsidence in any sex flush, less interest in sex, and a feeling of relaxation that can be attributed to the [[neurohormone]]s [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Exton MS, Kr\u00fcger TH, Koch M, etal |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287\u201394 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb194b5e0370574c39ab5765d9e7221aa6a213c7 }}</ref> The intensity and duration of the refractory period can be very short in a highly aroused young man in what he sees as a highly arousing situation, perhaps without even a noticeable loss of erection. It can be as long as a few hours or days in mid-life and older men.<ref name=\"NHS\"/>\n\n====Female ====\nThe beginnings of sexual arousal in a woman's body is usually marked by [[vaginal lubrication]] (wetness; though this can occur without arousal due to infection or cervical mucus production around ovulation), swelling and engorgement of the [[Vulva|external genitals]], and internal lengthening and enlargement of the [[vagina]].<ref name=\"Soucasaux\">{{cite web|last=Soucasaux|first=Nelson|title=The Female Sexual Response|url=http://www.nelsonginecologia.med.br/femalesexresp_engl.htm|work=Novas Perspectivas em Ginecologia|accessdate=10 August 2010|year=1990}}</ref> There have been studies to find the degree of correlation between these physiological responses and the woman's subjective sensation of being sexually aroused: the findings usually are that in some cases there is a high correlation, while in others, it is surprisingly low.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rellini|first=Alessandra H.|author2=Katie M.

Further changes to the internal organs also occur including to the internal shape of the vagina and to the position of the [[uterus]] within the [[human pelvis|pelvis]].<ref name=\"Soucasaux\"/> Other changes include an increase in [[heart rate]] as well as in [[blood pressure]], feeling hot and flushed and perhaps experiencing tremors.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKinne|first=Kathleen|title=Sexuality in close relationship|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-8058-0719-6|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4pG9ULmRTRsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> A [[sex flush]] may extend over the chest and upper body.\n\nIf sexual stimulation continues, then sexual arousal may peak into [[orgasm]]. After orgasm, some women do not want any further stimulation and the sexual arousal quickly dissipates. Suggestions have been published for continuing the sexual excitement and moving from one orgasm into further stimulation and maintaining or regaining a state of sexual arousal that can lead to second and subsequent orgasms.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Rourke|first=Theresa|title=Orgasms Unlimited|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips-moves/Orgasms-Unlimited|work=Cosmopolitan|publisher=Hearst Communications|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> Some women have experienced such multiple orgasms quite spontaneously.\n\nWhile young women may become sexually aroused quite easily, and reach orgasm relatively quickly with the right stimulation in the right circumstances, there are physical and psychological changes to women's sexual arousal and responses as they age. Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after [[menopause]]. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status. It is therefore seen as important always to understand the \"context of women's lives\" when studying their sexuality.<ref name=\"sexualityandu.ca\"/>\n\nReduced [[estrogen]] levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness and less [[clitoral erection]] when aroused, but are not directly related to other aspects of sexual interest or arousal. In older women, decreased pelvic muscle tone may mean that it takes longer for arousal to lead to orgasm, may diminish the intensity of orgasms, and then cause more rapid resolution.

In contrast, men with arousal problems tend to do just the opposite, thinking of every instance of difficulty as a sign of a long-term internal problem, either physiological or psychological.}}</ref> There are reported differences in brain activation to sexual stimuli, with men showing higher levels of [[amygdala]] and [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] responses than women.

Masters and Virginia E. Johnson]] conducted many important studies into [[human sexuality]]. In 1966, they published ''[[Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response]]'', detailing four stages of physiological changes in humans during sexual stimulation: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/sexual-response-cycle\n| title = The Sexual Response Cycle\n| accessdate = 2007-04-24\n| work = SexInfo\n| publisher = [[University of California]], Santa Barbara\n| quote = Masters and Johnson's Four-Phase Model: The sexual responses of men and women have many similarities....\n}}</ref>\n\n===Singer's model of sexual arousal===\nBarry Singer presented a model of the process of sexual arousal in 1984, in which he conceptualized human sexual response to be composed of ''three independent but generally sequential components''. The first stage, ''aesthetic response,'' is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, ''approach response,'' progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final ''genital response'' stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is ''the most reliable and convenient to measure'' in males.<ref name=\"singer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = B | year = 1984 | title = Conceptualizing sexual arousal and attraction | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013240 | doi=10.1080/00224498409551222}}</ref>\n\n===Basson's sexual response cycle===\nIn 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is ''specific to women\u2019s sexual response''.<ref name=\"A different model\">{{cite journal | last1 = Basson | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The female sexual response: A different model | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 51\u201365 | doi=10.1080/009262300278641 | pmid=10693116| doi-access = free }}</ref> She argues that gender differences in [[sex drive]], sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's<ref name=\"autogenerated2001\"/> alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for [[intimacy]], which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to [[sexual desire]]. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of [[female sexual dysfunction]]; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity.<ref name=\"A different model\"/>\n\n===Toates's incentive-motivation model===\nFrederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of ''incentive-motivation theory'' and ''hierarchical control of behavior''. The [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|basic incentive-motivation model]] of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering [[cognitive]] representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toates | first1 = F. | title = An Integrative Theoretical Framework for Understanding Sexual Motivation, Arousal, and Behavior | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747768 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 168\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19308842| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Bancroft's dual control model===\nThis model created by [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the ''individual variability of sexual response''.  They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book ''Come as You Are'', the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.<ref name=Nagoski2015>Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref>  The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels.  A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors.  These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). \n \nThe SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates.<ref name=Graham2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = C.

A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI).  This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender.  One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.\n\nRegardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition.  In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women.  On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition.  As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. \n \nThe source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively.  Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals.  Age of first [[masturbation]] has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.<ref name= Bancroft_et_al.,2003>Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003).

If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly ([[Clarkson University]]) describes this model as follows:\n{{Quotation|For centuries, the assumption was made that the longing for [[Sexual intercourse|sexual interaction]] was innate, and an inner drive model was used to explain it. It has been suggested that this model was much like a metaphor for a steam boiler.

An erection, for example, is pleasurable and painful at the same time. With an increase of sexual excitation, the tension increases and becomes wholly unpleasurable.

Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst.

There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. [[Vaginal photoplethysmography]] (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. [[Clitoral photoplethysmograph]]y functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. [[Thermography (sexual psychophysiology)|Thermography]] provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in [[temperature]] associated with increased blood flow to the [[external genitals|external genital]] tissues. Similarly, [[labial thermistor clip]]s measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, [[laser doppler imaging]] (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues.\n\n==Category-specificity==\nCategory-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with.

This hypothesis suggests that, provided there is enough of an increase in vaginal blood flow for [[vaginal lubrication]] to occur in a sexual context, the magnitude of arousal need not be consistent. That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is [[Rape|non-consensual]].<ref name=\"stable\" />\n\nOther researchers argue that since the research is done on people who volunteer to be studied, the observed levels of category specificity may not represent the population, that there may be different cultural expectations of sexual interests being linked to genital arousal that make men with non-category specific genital arousal less likely to appear as test subjects. There researchers also argue that the assumption that men are always sexually interested in what causes genital arousal removes its own falsifiability by explaining all contradictory data away as \"denial\", making the theory untestable.<ref>Research Methods in Psychiatry, third edition. Chris Freeman, Peter J.</ref><ref>Issues in Psychology and Psychiatry Research and Practice: 2013 Edition. Q Ashton Acton</ref>\n\n===Overlapping brain variables and sexual arousal===\nWhile there is disagreement among neurologists on whether or not it is possible to categorically distinguish male brains and female brains by measuring many variables in the brain, neurologists agree that all single variables in the brain display more individual variation and overlap between the sexes than differences between the sexes. For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468.full Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic] October 23, 2015</ref><ref>Multivariate revisit to \u201csex beyond the genitalia\u201d</ref>\n\n==Concordance==\nSexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed ''concordance''. Research has shown a [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] gender difference in concordance of sexual arousal, such that men have a higher level of concordance between genital and subjective sexual responding than women do.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suschinsky | first1 = K.

A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for [[sexual intercourse]] and continue during it. [[#Male physiological response|Male arousal]] will lead to an [[erection]], and in [[#Female physiological response|female arousal]] the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as [[Erection of nipples|nipples]], [[vulva]], [[Clitoral erection|clitoris]], [[Vagina#Sexual activity|vaginal wall]]s and [[vaginal lubrication]]. [[Stimulus (psychology)|Mental stimuli]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimuli]] such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of [[hormones]], can influence sexual arousal.\n\nSexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient [[sexual stimulation]], sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an [[orgasm]]. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm.\n\n==Terminology==\nThere are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including ''horny'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horny |title=horny - definition of horny by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> ''turned on'', ''randy'', ''steamy'', and ''lustful''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synonyms.net/synonym/aroused |title=aroused synonym. |publisher=Synonyms.net |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called '''erotic stimuli''' and colloquially known as '''turn-ons'''.\n\n==Erotic stimuli==\n{{Main|Sexual stimulation|Erogenous zone}}\n\nDepending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an [[erogenous zone]] or acts of [[foreplay]] can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a [[romance (love)|romantic]] setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal.\n\nStimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: [[somatosensory]] (touch), visual, and [[olfactory]] (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including [[kiss]]ing, [[hug|cuddling]], and [[petting]] of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the [[breast]]s, [[nipple]]s, [[buttocks]] and/or [[Sex organ|genitals]], and further [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].\n\nErotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find [[nudity]], [[erotica]] or [[pornography]] sexually arousing.<ref>DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \"[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200512/lust-the-long-haul Lust For The Long Haul]\". [[Psychology Today]]. 2008-12-26</ref> This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as [[sexual fetishism]], or in some instances a [[paraphilia]].\n\nThere is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal]] (in Canada) used the method of [[thermal]] imaging to record baseline [[temperature]] change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal&nbsp;\u2014 around 10 minutes.<ref name=intro/> The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html|title=Your introduction to foreplay|accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618222527/http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other animals, [[human]]s do not have a [[mating season]], and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year.\n\n==Disorders==\n{{see also|Sexual arousal disorder|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Female sexual arousal disorder}}\n\nSexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are [[sexually inhibited]]. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person.\n\nHowever, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a [[sexual arousal disorder]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]]. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, a person may be [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a [[persistent genital arousal disorder]], which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal.\n\n== Physiological and psychological response patterns ==\n=== Physiological responses ===\n\nSexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the [[sex organ]]s (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the [[tumescence|swelling]] and [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] when blood fills the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the [[clitoris]] and [[vulva]], as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%\"|\nIn males:\n!In females:\n|-\n|[[File:Comparison of flaccid and erect penis.jpg|thumb]]<br /><small>Male sexual arousal.

Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after [[menopause]]. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status. It is therefore seen as important always to understand the \"context of women's lives\" when studying their sexuality.<ref name=\"sexualityandu.ca\"/>\n\nReduced [[estrogen]] levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness and less [[clitoral erection]] when aroused, but are not directly related to other aspects of sexual interest or arousal. In older women, decreased pelvic muscle tone may mean that it takes longer for arousal to lead to orgasm, may diminish the intensity of orgasms, and then cause more rapid resolution.

The first stage, ''aesthetic response,'' is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, ''approach response,'' progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final ''genital response'' stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is ''the most reliable and convenient to measure'' in males.<ref name=\"singer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = B | year = 1984 | title = Conceptualizing sexual arousal and attraction | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013240 | doi=10.1080/00224498409551222}}</ref>\n\n===Basson's sexual response cycle===\nIn 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is ''specific to women\u2019s sexual response''.<ref name=\"A different model\">{{cite journal | last1 = Basson | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The female sexual response: A different model | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 51\u201365 | doi=10.1080/009262300278641 | pmid=10693116| doi-access = free }}</ref> She argues that gender differences in [[sex drive]], sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's<ref name=\"autogenerated2001\"/> alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for [[intimacy]], which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to [[sexual desire]]. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of [[female sexual dysfunction]]; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity.<ref name=\"A different model\"/>\n\n===Toates's incentive-motivation model===\nFrederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of ''incentive-motivation theory'' and ''hierarchical control of behavior''. The [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|basic incentive-motivation model]] of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering [[cognitive]] representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toates | first1 = F. | title = An Integrative Theoretical Framework for Understanding Sexual Motivation, Arousal, and Behavior | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747768 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 168\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19308842| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Bancroft's dual control model===\nThis model created by [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the ''individual variability of sexual response''.  They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book ''Come as You Are'', the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.<ref name=Nagoski2015>Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref>  The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels.  A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors.  These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). \n \nThe SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates.<ref name=Graham2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = C.

A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI).  This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender.  One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.\n\nRegardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition.  In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women.  On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition.  As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. \n \nThe source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively.  Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals.  Age of first [[masturbation]] has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.<ref name= Bancroft_et_al.,2003>Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003).

If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly ([[Clarkson University]]) describes this model as follows:\n{{Quotation|For centuries, the assumption was made that the longing for [[Sexual intercourse|sexual interaction]] was innate, and an inner drive model was used to explain it. It has been suggested that this model was much like a metaphor for a steam boiler. Internal sexual \u201csteam\u201d would build up until the pressure became so great that the drive to release it was very strong. This view also assumed that there was some adverse physical consequence of not releasing the pressure.<ref>{{cite book | last=Kelly | first=Gary F. | title=Sexuality Today: The Human Perspective | edition=7 | year=2001 | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | isbn=978-0-697-29431-9 | page=95 | chapter=Chapter 4 }}</ref>{{rp|95|}} }}\n\nThe \"psychohydraulic model of sexuality\" has been formulated most definitely in [[psychoanalysis]]:\n{{Quotation|The instinct causes tensions within the central nervous system which spread out over the whole being; it is urgent and irresistible in nature and constantly repeats itself.&nbsp;... An erection, for example, is pleasurable and painful at the same time. With an increase of sexual excitation, the tension increases and becomes wholly unpleasurable. This condition becomes so unbearable that the individual is forced to seek release from these tensions and liberation from the painful feelings.&nbsp;... The pain of tension which accompanies the increase in the intensity of the instinctual drives changes, with the discharge, into the pleasure of relaxation.<ref>{{cite book | last  = Nunberg | first  = Hermann | authorlink = Hermann Nunberg | title = Principles of Psychoanalysis.

Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst. Drawing a parallel between these sensations and sexual excitation is widely accepted now: \"Everyone must experience sexuality in some way to survive.&nbsp;... In this sense sex is a necessity of life, just as air, food, and warmth.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Coleman | first = E. | editor = Eli Coleman| title = Chemical Dependency and Intimacy Dysfunction | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=MmA78fbMYEwC&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | isbn = 978-0-86656-640-7 | pages = 189\u2013204 | chapter = Sexual Compulsivity: Definition, Etiology and Treatment Considerations | accessdate = 2013-11-03 }}</ref>{{rp|190|}} And yet there is no empirical evidence in support of such a parallel, Imieli\u0144ski says. Sensations of hunger and thirst occur due to certain states of physiological insufficiency. The feeling of hunger results from the lack of glucose, fats and amino acids in blood. The feeling of thirst occurs in response to reduction of the water content of tissues. None of similar states of physiological deficiency responsible for the periodical appearance of sexual arousal has been revealed in human sexuality.<ref>[[Kazimierz Imieli\u0144ski|\u0418\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a.]]. \u0421\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f (Sexology a.

There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. [[Vaginal photoplethysmography]] (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. [[Clitoral photoplethysmograph]]y functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. [[Thermography (sexual psychophysiology)|Thermography]] provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in [[temperature]] associated with increased blood flow to the [[external genitals|external genital]] tissues. Similarly, [[labial thermistor clip]]s measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, [[laser doppler imaging]] (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues.\n\n==Category-specificity==\nCategory-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with. Sexual arousal studies involving category-specificity look at genital responses (physiological changes), as well as subjective responses (what people report their arousal levels to be). Category-specific sexual arousal is more commonly found amongst men than women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Leading comment: A brief review and discussion of sex differences in the specificity of sexual arousal | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 377\u2013390 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.513.4313 | doi = 10.1080/14681990500238802 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15482445\">{{cite journal|last=Chivers|first=ML|author2=Rieger, G |author3=Latty, E |author4= Bailey, JM |title=A sex difference in the specificity of sexual arousal.|journal=Psychological Science|date=Nov 2004|volume=15|issue=11|pages=736\u201344|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00750.x|pmid=15482445}}</ref> [[Heterosexuality|Heterosexual]] men experience much higher genital and subjective arousal to women than to men.

This hypothesis suggests that, provided there is enough of an increase in vaginal blood flow for [[vaginal lubrication]] to occur in a sexual context, the magnitude of arousal need not be consistent. That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is [[Rape|non-consensual]].<ref name=\"stable\" />\n\nOther researchers argue that since the research is done on people who volunteer to be studied, the observed levels of category specificity may not represent the population, that there may be different cultural expectations of sexual interests being linked to genital arousal that make men with non-category specific genital arousal less likely to appear as test subjects. There researchers also argue that the assumption that men are always sexually interested in what causes genital arousal removes its own falsifiability by explaining all contradictory data away as \"denial\", making the theory untestable.<ref>Research Methods in Psychiatry, third edition. Chris Freeman, Peter J.</ref><ref>Issues in Psychology and Psychiatry Research and Practice: 2013 Edition. Q Ashton Acton</ref>\n\n===Overlapping brain variables and sexual arousal===\nWhile there is disagreement among neurologists on whether or not it is possible to categorically distinguish male brains and female brains by measuring many variables in the brain, neurologists agree that all single variables in the brain display more individual variation and overlap between the sexes than differences between the sexes. For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468.full Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic] October 23, 2015</ref><ref>Multivariate revisit to \u201csex beyond the genitalia\u201d</ref>\n\n==Concordance==\nSexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed ''concordance''. Research has shown a [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] gender difference in concordance of sexual arousal, such that men have a higher level of concordance between genital and subjective sexual responding than women do.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suschinsky | first1 = K.

They then go onto to defining it as a practice that assesses how events, stories etc. are interrelated in different parts of the world, which has occurred due to globalization and digitization.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nKurysheva, Puiy, Litvinenko, Bykov, and Danilov also emphasize the importance of conceptualizing the notion of global journalism as the practices are detached from the theory. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Kurysheva|first=Yulia Vladimirovna|last2=Puiy|first2=Anatoli Stepanovich|last3=Litvinenko|first3=Anna Alexandrovna|last4=Bykov|first4=Aleksei Yuryevich|last5=Danilova|first5=Iuliia Sokratovna|date=2015-12-05|title=Global Journalism: Main Aspects of Conceptualization|url=http://www.econjournals.com/index.php/irmm/article/view/1621|journal=International Review of Management and Marketing|language=en|volume=5|issue=1S|pages=67\u201372|issn=2146-4405}}</ref> They further go onto identifying four main aspects through which global journalism can be conceptualized: geographical, discursive, political and economic, and lastly, professional. <ref name=\":3\" /> Firstly, the geographical aspect focuses on how the globality of the Internet has allowed for the free flow of information that transcends national boundaries and allows for citizens around the world to be informed about events that are not necessarily occurring within their national borders, thus establishing global journalism.<ref name=\":3\" /> \u00a0Therefore, the geographical approach focuses on the system of global journalism. Secondly, the discursive aspect pinpoints the content and identifies the two basic forms.<ref name=\":3\" /> Thirdly, the political and economic aspect focus on the geopolitical features of global journalism.<ref name=\":3\" /> \u00a0Lastly, the professional aspect examines how journalism transforms under the process of globalization.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nJohan Lindell and Michael Karlsson define global journalism as journalism that sees the interrelationships between different parts of the world, and thus provide a \"global outlook\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Lindell|first=Johan|last2=Karlsson|first2=Michael|date=2016-04-04|title=Cosmopolitan Journalists?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670x.2016.1165137|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=17|issue=7|pages=860\u2013870|doi=10.1080/1461670x.2016.1165137|issn=1461-670X}}</ref> \u00a0In addition, they identify three principles for global journalism, or more specific the role that journalists would play in global journalism. First of all, journalists must become global agents of the global public sphere instead of a nation-state or local states.<ref name=\":4\" /> \u00a0Secondly, journalists must prioritize the global public sphere, as in their audience are the citizens of the world.<ref name=\":4\" /> \u00a0Lastly, journalists must promote a global outlook in opposition to a local or a national outlook.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\nFirstly, to explain the history of global journalism, it must be established that global journalism is an emerging practice amongst the journalistic field that has much scope and several implications on the global public sphere. Considering this, it still is a fairly new notion that requires much needed conceptualization. In other words, global journalism is occurring at an unprecedented rate, yet academia and scholars lack not only the empirical evidence<ref name=\":3\" /> but also proper conceptualization of the term. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RgFlAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Global+Journalism%22&dq=%22Global+Journalism%22|title=Global journalism: a survey of the world's mass media|last=Merrill|first=John Calhoun|date=1983|publisher=Longman|isbn=9780582283381|language=en}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JLEVQozKrlIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Global+Journalism%22#v=onepage&q=%22Global%20Journalism%22&f=false|title=Practising Global Journalism: Exploring reporting issues worldwide|last=Herbert|first=John|date=2013-02-11|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781136029851|language=en}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A2ZlAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Global+Journalism%22|title=Global Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Findings, Future|last=L\u00f6ffelholz|first=Martin|last2=Weaver|first2=David|date=2008-02-11|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781405153324|language=en}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HYSoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Global+Journalism%22#v=onepage&q=%22Global%20Journalism%22&f=false|title=Global Journalism Practice and New Media Performance|last=Jr|first=Yusuf Kalyango|last2=Mould|first2=D.|date=2014-10-21|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137440563|language=en}}\n*Wasserman, Herman (2011-04-01). \"Global journalism studies: Beyond panoramas\".

SAML&nbsp;2.0 is an [[XML]]-based [[communications protocol|protocol]] that uses [[software token|security tokens]] containing [[Security Assertion Markup Language|assertions]] to pass information about a principal (usually an end user) between a SAML authority, named an [[Identity Provider]], and a SAML consumer, named a [[Service Provider]].  SAML&nbsp;2.0 enables web-based, cross-domain [[single sign-on]] (SSO), which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing multiple authentication tokens to the user.\n\nSAML&nbsp;2.0 was ratified as an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] Standard in March 2005, replacing [[SAML 1.1]].  The critical aspects of SAML&nbsp;2.0 are covered in detail in the official documents SAMLCore,<ref name=\"SAMLCore\"/> SAMLBind,<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/> SAMLProf,<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/> and SAMLMeta.<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>\n\nSome 30 individuals from more than 24 companies and organizations were involved in the creation of SAML&nbsp;2.0.  In particular, and of special note, [[Liberty Alliance]] donated its Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) specification to OASIS, which became the basis of the SAML&nbsp;2.0 specification.  Thus SAML&nbsp;2.0 represents the convergence of [[SAML 1.1]], [http://www.projectliberty.org/resource_center/specifications/liberty_alliance_id_ff_1_2_specifications Liberty ID-FF&nbsp;1.2], and [http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/docs/internet2-mace-shibboleth-arch-protocols-200509.pdf Shibboleth&nbsp;1.3].\n\n==SAML 2.0 assertions==\n\nAn assertion is a package of information that supplies zero or more statements made by a SAML authority. SAML assertions are usually made about a subject, represented by the <code><Subject></code> element. The SAML 2.0 specification defines three different kinds of assertion statements that can be created by a SAML authority. All SAML-defined statements are associated with a subject. The three kinds of statements defined are as follows:\n* Authentication Assertion: The assertion subject was authenticated by a particular means at a particular time.\n* Attribute Assertion: The assertion subject is associated with the supplied attributes.\n* Authorization Decision Assertion: A request to allow the assertion subject to access the specified resource has been granted or denied.\n\nAn important type of SAML assertion is the so-called <span id=\"BearerAssertion\">\"bearer\" assertion</span> used to facilitate Web Browser SSO.  Here is an example of a short-lived bearer assertion issued by an identity provider (<nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</nowiki>) to a service provider (<nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</nowiki>).  The assertion includes both an Authentication Assertion <code><saml:AuthnStatement></code> and an Attribute Assertion <code><saml:AttributeStatement></code>, which presumably the service provider uses to make an access control decision. The prefix <code>saml:</code> represents the SAML V2.0 assertion namespace.\n\n=== Example of SAML ===\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<saml:Assertion\n   xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n   xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n   ID=\"_d71a3a8e9fcc45c9e9d248ef7049393fc8f04e5f75\"\n   Version=\"2.0\"\n   IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\">\n   <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n   <ds:Signature\n     xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n   <saml:Subject>\n     <saml:NameID\n       Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\">\n       3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8\n     </saml:NameID>\n     <saml:SubjectConfirmation\n       Method=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\">\n       <saml:SubjectConfirmationData\n         InResponseTo=\"aaf23196-1773-2113-474a-fe114412ab72\"\n         Recipient=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"\n         NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\"/>\n     </saml:SubjectConfirmation>\n   </saml:Subject>\n   <saml:Conditions\n     NotBefore=\"2004-12-05T09:17:05Z\"\n     NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\">\n     <saml:AudienceRestriction>\n       <saml:Audience>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Audience>\n     </saml:AudienceRestriction>\n   </saml:Conditions>\n   <saml:AuthnStatement\n     AuthnInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\"\n     SessionIndex=\"b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac\">\n     <saml:AuthnContext>\n       <saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport\n       </saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n     </saml:AuthnContext>\n   </saml:AuthnStatement>\n   <saml:AttributeStatement>\n     <saml:Attribute\n       xmlns:x500=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:attribute:X500\"\n       x500:Encoding=\"LDAP\"\n       NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n       Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1\"\n       FriendlyName=\"eduPersonAffiliation\">\n       <saml:AttributeValue\n         xsi:type=\"xs:string\">member</saml:AttributeValue>\n       <saml:AttributeValue\n         xsi:type=\"xs:string\">staff</saml:AttributeValue>\n     </saml:Attribute>\n   </saml:AttributeStatement>\n </saml:Assertion>\n</source>\n\nNote that in the above example the <code><saml:Assertion></code> element contains the following child elements:\n\n* a <code><saml:Issuer></code> element, which contains the unique identifier of the identity provider\n* a <code><ds:Signature></code> element, which contains an integrity-preserving digital signature (not shown) over the <code><saml:Assertion></code> element\n* a <code><saml:Subject></code> element, which identifies the authenticated principal (but in this case the identity of the principal is hidden behind an opaque transient identifier, for reasons of privacy)\n* a <code><saml:Conditions></code> element, which gives the conditions under which the assertion is to be considered ''valid''\n* a <code><saml:AuthnStatement></code> element, which describes the act of authentication at the identity provider\n* a <code><saml:AttributeStatement></code> element, which asserts a multi-valued attribute associated with the authenticated principal\n\nIn words, the assertion encodes the following information:\n\n<blockquote>The assertion (\"b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac\") was issued at time \"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\" by identity provider (<nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</nowiki>) regarding subject (3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8) exclusively for service provider (<nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</nowiki>).</blockquote>\n\nThe authentication statement, in particular, asserts the following:\n\n<blockquote>The principal identified in the <code><saml:Subject></code> element was authenticated at time \"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\" by means of a password sent over a protected channel.</blockquote>\n\nLikewise the attribute statement asserts that:\n\n<blockquote>The principal identified in the <code><saml:Subject></code> element is a staff member at this institution.</blockquote>\n\n==SAML 2.0 protocols==\n\nThe following protocols are specified in SAMLCore:<ref name=\"SAMLCore\"/>\n\n* Assertion Query and Request Protocol\n* [[#Authentication Request Protocol|Authentication Request Protocol]]\n* [[#Artifact Resolution Protocol|Artifact Resolution Protocol]]\n* Name Identifier Management Protocol\n* Single Logout Protocol\n* Name Identifier Mapping Protocol\n\nThe most important of these protocols&mdash;the Authentication Request Protocol&mdash;is discussed in detail below.\n\n===Authentication Request Protocol===\n\nIn [[SAML 1.1]] Web Browser SSO Profiles are initiated by the [[Identity provider|Identity Provider (IDP)]], that is, an unsolicited <code><samlp:Response></code> element is transmitted from the identity provider to the service provider (via the browser). (The prefix <code>samlp:</code> denotes the SAML protocol namespace.) \n\nIn SAML&nbsp;2.0, however, the flow begins at the service provider who issues an explicit authentication request to the identity provider.  The resulting ''Authentication Request Protocol'' is a significant new feature of SAML&nbsp;2.0.\n\nWhen a principal (or an entity acting on the principal's behalf) wishes to obtain an assertion containing an authentication statement, a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element is transmitted to the identity provider:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:AuthnRequest\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"aaf23196-1773-2113-474a-fe114412ab72\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\"\n    AssertionConsumerServiceIndex=\"0\"\n    AttributeConsumingServiceIndex=\"0\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:NameIDPolicy\n      AllowCreate=\"true\"\n      Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\"/>\n  </samlp:AuthnRequest>\n</source>\nThe above <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element, which implicitly requests [[#SAML 2.0 Assertions|an assertion containing an authentication statement]], was evidently issued by a service provider (<nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</nowiki>) and subsequently presented to the identity provider (via the browser).  The identity provider authenticates the principal (if necessary) and issues an authentication response, which is transmitted back to the service provider (again via the browser).\n\n===Artifact Resolution Protocol===\n\nA SAML message is transmitted from one entity to another either ''by value'' or ''by reference''.  A reference to a SAML message is called an ''artifact''.  The receiver of an artifact resolves the reference by sending a <code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> request directly to the issuer of the artifact, who then responds with the actual message referenced by the artifact.\n\nSuppose, for example, that an identity provider sends the following <span id=\"ArtifactResolveRequest\"><code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> request</span> directly to a service provider (via a back channel):\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:ArtifactResolve\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"_cce4ee769ed970b501d680f697989d14\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:58Z\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <!-- an ArtifactResolve message SHOULD be signed -->\n    <ds:Signature\n      xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n    <samlp:Artifact>AAQAAMh48/1oXIM+sDo7Dh2qMp1HM4IF5DaRNmDj6RdUmllwn9jJHyEgIi8=</samlp:Artifact>\n  </samlp:ArtifactResolve>\n</source>\nIn response, the service provider returns the SAML element referenced by the enclosed artifact.  This protocol forms the basis of the [[#HTTP Artifact Binding|HTTP Artifact Binding]].\n\n==SAML 2.0 bindings==\n\nThe ''bindings'' supported by SAML&nbsp;2.0 are outlined in the Bindings specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>):\n\n* SAML SOAP Binding (based on SOAP&nbsp;1.1)\n* Reverse SOAP (PAOS) Binding\n* [[#HTTP Redirect Binding|HTTP Redirect Binding]]\n* [[#HTTP POST Binding|HTTP POST Binding]]\n* [[#HTTP Artifact Binding|HTTP Artifact Binding]]\n* SAML URI Binding\n\nFor Web Browser SSO, the HTTP Redirect Binding and the HTTP POST Binding are commonly used.  For example, the service provider may use HTTP Redirect to send a request while the identity provider uses HTTP POST to transmit the response.  This example illustrates that an entity's choice of binding is independent of its partner's choice of binding.\n\n===HTTP Redirect Binding===\n\nSAML protocol messages can be carried directly in the URL query string of an HTTP GET request. Since the length of URLs is limited in practice, the HTTP Redirect binding is suitable for short messages, such as the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message. Longer messages (e.g. those containing signed or encrypted SAML assertions, such as SAML Responses) are usually transmitted via other bindings such as the [[#HTTP POST Binding|HTTP POST Binding]].\n\nSAML requests or responses transmitted via HTTP Redirect have a <code>SAMLRequest</code> or <code>SAMLResponse</code> query string parameter, respectively. Before it's sent, the message is deflated (without header and checksum), [[base64]]-encoded, and URL-encoded, in that order. Upon receipt, the process is reversed to recover the original message.\n\nFor example, encoding the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message above yields:\n\n  <nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=fZFfa8IwFMXfBb9DyXvaJtZ1BqsURRC2\n Mabbw95ivc5Am3TJrXPffmmLY3%2FA15Pzuyf33On8XJXBCaxTRmeEhTEJQBdmr%2FRbRp63K3pL5rPhYOpkVdY\n ib%2FCon%2BC9AYfDQRB4WDvRvWWksVoY6ZQTWlbgBBZik9%2FfCR7GorYGTWFK8pu6DknnwKL%2FWEetlxmR8s\n BHbHJDWZqOKGdsRJM0kfQAjCUJ43KX8s78ctnIz%2Blp5xpYa4dSo1fjOKGM03i8jSeCMzGevHa2%2FBK5MNo1F\n dgN2JMqPLmHc0b6WTmiVbsGoTf5qv66Zq2t60x0wXZ2RKydiCJXh3CWVV1CWJgqanfl0%2Bin8xutxYOvZL18NK\n UqPlvZR5el%2BVhYkAgZQdsA6fWVsZXE63W2itrTQ2cVaKV2CjSSqL1v9P%2FAXv4C</nowiki>\n\nThe above message (formatted for readability) may be signed for additional security. In practice, all the data contained in a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code>, such as <code>Issuer</code> which contains the SP ID, and <code>NameIDPolicy</code>, has been agreed between IdP and SP beforehand (via manual information exchange or via [[#SAML 2.0 Metadata|SAML metadata]]). In that case signing the request is not a security constraint. When the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> contains information not known by the IdP beforehand, such as Assertion Consumer Service URL, signing the request is recommended for security purposes.\n\n===HTTP POST Binding===\n\nIn the following example, both the service provider and the identity provider use an HTTP POST binding.  Initially, the service provider responds to a request from the [[user agent]] with a document containing an XHTML form:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n  <form method=\"post\" action=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/POST\" ...>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLRequest\" value=\"''request''\" />\n    ... other input parameter....\n  </form>\n</source>\nThe value of the <code>SAMLRequest</code> parameter is the base64-encoding of a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element, which is transmitted to the identity provider via the browser.  The SSO service at the identity provider validates the request and responds with a document containing another XHTML form:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n  <form method=\"post\" action=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\" ...>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLResponse\" value=\"''response''\" />\n    ...\n  </form>\n</source>\nThe value of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> parameter is the base64 encoding of a <code><samlp:Response></code> element, which likewise is transmitted to the service provider via the browser.\n\nTo automate the submission of the form, the following line of JavaScript may appear anywhere on the XHTML page:\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n  window.onload = function () { document.forms[0].submit(); }\n</source>\nThis assumes, of course, that the first form element in the page contains the above SAMLResponse containing <code>form</code> element (<code>forms[0]</code>).\n\n===HTTP Artifact Binding===\n\nThe HTTP Artifact Binding uses the [[#Artifact Resolution Protocol|Artifact Resolution Protocol]] and the SAML SOAP Binding (over HTTP) to resolve a SAML message by reference.  Consider the following specific example.  Suppose a service provider wants to send a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message to an identity provider.  Initially, the service provider transmits an artifact to the identity provider via an HTTP redirect:\n\n  <nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Artifact</nowiki>?SAMLart=''artifact''\n\nNext the identity provider sends a <code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> request (such as the [[#ArtifactResolveRequest|ArtifactResolveRequest]] shown earlier) directly to the service provider via a back channel.  Finally, the service provider returns a <code><samlp:ArtifactResponse></code> element containing the referenced <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:ArtifactResponse\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    ID=\"_d84a49e5958803dedcff4c984c2b0d95\"\n    InResponseTo=\"_cce4ee769ed970b501d680f697989d14\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\">\n    <!-- an ArtifactResponse message SHOULD be signed -->\n    <ds:Signature\n      xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n    <samlp:Status>\n      <samlp:StatusCode\n        Value=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success\"/>\n    </samlp:Status>\n    <samlp:AuthnRequest\n      xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n      xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n      ID=\"_306f8ec5b618f361c70b6ffb1480eade\"\n      Version=\"2.0\"\n      IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\"\n      Destination=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Artifact\"\n      ProtocolBinding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact\"\n      AssertionConsumerServiceURL=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/Artifact\">\n      <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n      <samlp:NameIDPolicy\n        AllowCreate=\"false\"\n        Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\"/>\n    </samlp:AuthnRequest>\n  </samlp:ArtifactResponse>\n</source>\n\nOf course the flow can go in the other direction as well, that is, the identity provider may issue an artifact, and in fact this is more common.  See, for example, the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile example later in this topic.\n\n====Artifact format====\n\nIn general, a SAML&nbsp;2.0 ''artifact'' is defined as follows (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>):\n\n  SAML_artifact := B64 (TypeCode EndpointIndex RemainingArtifact)\n  TypeCode      := Byte1Byte2\n  EndpointIndex := Byte1Byte2\n\nThus a SAML&nbsp;2.0 artifact consists of three components: a two-byte <code>TypeCode</code>, a two-byte <code>EndpointIndex</code>, and an arbitrary sequence of bytes called the <code>RemainingArtifact</code>.  These three pieces of information are concatenated and base64-encoded to yield the complete artifact.\n\nThe <code>TypeCode</code> uniquely identifies the artifact format.  SAML&nbsp;2.0 predefines just one such artifact, of type&nbsp;0x0004.  The <code>EndpointIndex</code> is a reference to a particular artifact resolution endpoint managed by the artifact issuer (which may be either the IdP or the SP, as mentioned earlier).  The <code>RemainingArtifact</code>, which is determined by the type definition, is the \"meat\" of the artifact.\n\nThe format of a ''type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact'' is further defined as follows:\n\n  TypeCode            := 0x0004\n  RemainingArtifact   := SourceId MessageHandle\n  SourceId            := 20-byte_sequence\n  MessageHandle       := 20-byte_sequence\n\nThus a type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact is of size 44&nbsp;bytes (unencoded).  The <code>SourceId</code> is an arbitrary sequence of bytes, although in practice, the <code>SourceId</code> is the SHA-1 hash of the issuer's entityID.  The <code>MessageHandle</code> is a random sequence of bytes that references a SAML message that the artifact issuer is willing to produce on-demand.\n\nFor example, consider this hex-encoded type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact:\n\n  00040000c878f3fd685c833eb03a3b0e1daa329d47338205e436913660e3e917549a59709fd8c91f2120222f\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the <code>TypeCode</code> (0x0004) and the <code>EndpointIndex</code> (0x0000) at the front of the artifact.  The next 20&nbsp;bytes are the SHA-1 hash of the issuer's entityID (<nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</nowiki>) followed by 20 random bytes.  The base64-encoding of these 44&nbsp;bytes is what you see in the [[#ArtifactResolveRequest|ArtifactResolveRequest]] example above.\n\n==SAML 2.0 profiles==\n\nIn SAML&nbsp;2.0, as in SAML&nbsp;1.1, the primary use case is still Web Browser SSO, but the scope of SAML&nbsp;2.0 is broader than previous versions of SAML, as suggested in the following exhaustive list of profiles:\n\n* SSO Profiles\n** [[#Web_browser_SSO_profile|Web browser SSO profile]]\n** Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) Profile\n** [[#Identity_Provider_Discovery_Profile|Identity Provider Discovery Profile]]\n** Single Logout Profile\n** Name Identifier Management Profile\n* Artifact Resolution Profile\n* [[#Assertion_Query/Request_Profile|Assertion Query/Request Profile]]\n* Name Identifier Mapping Profile\n* SAML Attribute Profiles\n** Basic Attribute Profile\n** X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile\n** UUID Attribute Profile\n** DCE PAC Attribute Profile\n** XACML Attribute Profile\n\nAlthough the number of supported profiles is quite large, the Profiles specification (SAMLProf<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/>) is simplified since the binding aspects of each profile have been factored out into a separate Bindings specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>).\n\n===Web browser SSO profile===\n\nSAML&nbsp;2.0 specifies a ''Web Browser SSO Profile'' involving an identity provider (IdP), a service provider (SP), and a principal wielding an HTTP user agent.  The service provider has four bindings from which to choose while the identity provider has three, which leads to twelve (12) possible deployment scenarios.  We outline three of those deployment scenarios below.\n\n====SP redirect request; IdP POST response====\n\nThis is one of the most common scenarios. The service provider sends a SAML Request to the IdP SSO Service using the HTTP-Redirect Binding. The identity provider returns the SAML Response to the SP Assertion Consumer Service using the HTTP-POST Binding.\n\n[[File:Saml2-browser-sso-redirect-post.png|thumb|none|700px|SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO (SP Redirect Bind/ IdP POST Response)]]\n\nThe message flow begins with a request for a secured resource at the service provider.\n\n'''1. Request the target resource at the SP'''\n\nThe principal (via an HTTP user agent) requests a target resource at the service provider:\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/myresource</nowiki>\n\nThe service provider performs a security check on behalf of the target resource.  If a valid security context at the service provider already exists, skip steps 2&ndash;7.\n\nThe service provider may use any kind of mechanism to discover the identity provider that will be used, e.g., ask the user, use a preconfigured IdP, etc.\n\n'''2. Redirect to IdP SSO Service'''\n\nThe service provider generates an appropriate SAMLRequest (and RelayState, if any), then redirects the browser to the IdP SSO Service using a standard [[HTTP 302]] redirect.\n\n<source lang=\"http\">\n302 Redirect\nLocation: https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=request&RelayState=token\n</source>\n\nThe <code>RelayState</code> token is an opaque reference to state information maintained at the service provider.  The value of the <code>SAMLRequest</code> parameter is a deflated, base64-encoded and URL-encoded value of an <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:AuthnRequest\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"identifier_1\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\"\n    AssertionConsumerServiceIndex=\"0\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:NameIDPolicy\n      AllowCreate=\"true\"\n      Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\"/>\n  </samlp:AuthnRequest>\n</source>\n\nThe SAMLRequest may be signed using the SP signing key. Typically, however, this is not necessary.\n\n'''3. Request the SSO Service at the IdP'''\n\nThe user agent issues a GET request to the SSO service at the identity provider:\n\n<source lang=\"http\" highlight=\"6\">\nGET /SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=request&RelayState=token HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.example.org\n</source>\n\nwhere the values of the <code>SAMLRequest</code> and <code>RelayState</code> parameters are the same as those provided in the redirect.  The SSO Service at the identity provider processes the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element (by URL-decoding, base64-decoding and inflating the request, in that order) and performs a security check.  If the user does not have a valid security context, the identity provider identifies the user with any mechanism (details omitted).\n\n'''4. Respond with an XHTML form'''\n\nThe SSO Service validates the request and responds with a document containing an XHTML form:\n\n<source lang=\"html\" highlight=\"2-3\">\n  <form method=\"post\" action=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\" ...>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLResponse\" value=\"response\" />\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"RelayState\" value=\"token\" />\n    ...\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n  </form>\n</source>\n\nThe value of the <code>RelayState</code> parameter has been preserved from step&nbsp;3.  The value of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> parameter is the base64 encoding of the following <code><samlp:Response></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:Response\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"identifier_2\"\n    InResponseTo=\"identifier_1\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\"\n    Destination=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:Status>\n      <samlp:StatusCode\n        Value=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success\"/>\n    </samlp:Status>\n    <saml:Assertion\n      xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n      ID=\"identifier_3\"\n      Version=\"2.0\"\n      IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\">\n      <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n      <!-- a POSTed assertion MUST be signed -->\n      <ds:Signature\n        xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n      <saml:Subject>\n        <saml:NameID\n          Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\">\n          3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8\n        </saml:NameID>\n        <saml:SubjectConfirmation\n          Method=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\">\n          <saml:SubjectConfirmationData\n            InResponseTo=\"identifier_1\"\n            Recipient=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"\n            NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\"/>\n        </saml:SubjectConfirmation>\n      </saml:Subject>\n      <saml:Conditions\n        NotBefore=\"2004-12-05T09:17:05Z\"\n        NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\">\n        <saml:AudienceRestriction>\n          <saml:Audience>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Audience>\n        </saml:AudienceRestriction>\n      </saml:Conditions>\n      <saml:AuthnStatement\n        AuthnInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\"\n        SessionIndex=\"identifier_3\">\n        <saml:AuthnContext>\n          <saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n            urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport\n         </saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n        </saml:AuthnContext>\n      </saml:AuthnStatement>\n    </saml:Assertion>\n  </samlp:Response>\n</source>\n\n'''5. Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP'''\n\nThe user agent issues a POST request to the Assertion Consumer Service at the service provider:\n\n<source lang=\"http\" highlight=\"6\">\nPOST /SAML2/SSO/POST HTTP/1.1\nHost: sp.example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: nnn\n \nSAMLResponse=response&RelayState=token\n</source>\n\nwhere the values of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> and <code>RelayState</code> parameters are taken from the XHTML form at step&nbsp;4.\n\n'''6.

Redirect to the target resource'''\n\nThe assertion consumer service processes the response, creates a security context at the service provider and redirects the user agent to the target resource.\n\n'''11. Request the target resource at the SP again'''\n\nThe user agent requests the target resource at the service provider (again):\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/myresource</nowiki>\n\n'''12. Respond with the requested resource'''\n\nSince a security context exists, the service provider returns the resource to the user agent.\n\n===Identity provider discovery profile===\n\nThe SAML&nbsp;2.0 ''Identity Provider Discovery Profile'' introduces the following concepts:\n\n* '''Common Domain'''\n* '''Common Domain Cookie'''\n* '''Common Domain Cookie Writing Service'''\n* '''Common Domain Cookie Reading Service'''\n\nAs a hypothetical example of a ''Common Domain'', let's suppose Example UK (example.co.uk) and Example Deutschland (example.de) belong to the virtual organization Example Global Alliance (example.com).  In this example, the domain '''example.com''' is the common domain.  Both Example UK and Example Deutschland have a presence in this domain (uk.example.com and de.example.com, resp.).\n\nThe ''Common Domain Cookie'' is a secure browser cookie scoped to the common domain.  For each browser user, this cookie stores a history list of recently visited IdPs.  The name and value of the cookie are specified in the IdP Discovery Profile (SAMLProf<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/>).\n\nAfter a successful act of authentication, the IdP requests the ''Common Domain Cookie Writing Service''.  This service appends the IdP's unique identifier to the common domain cookie.  The SP, when it receives an unauthenticated request for a protected resource, requests the ''Common Domain Cookie Reading Service'' to discover the browser user's most recently used IdP.\n\n===Assertion query/request profile===\n\nThe ''Assertion Query/Request Profile'' is a general profile that accommodates numerous types of so-called ''queries'' using the following SAML&nbsp;2.0 elements:\n\n* the <code><samlp:AssertionIDRequest></code> element, which is used to request an assertion given its unique identifier (<code>ID</code>)\n* the <code><samlp:SubjectQuery></code> element, which is an abstract extension point that allows new subject-based SAML queries to be defined\n* the <code><samlp:AuthnQuery></code> element, which is used to request '''existing''' authentication assertions about a given subject from an Authentication Authority\n* the <code><samlp:AttributeQuery></code> element, which is used to request attributes about a given subject from an Attribute Authority\n* the <code><samlp:AuthzDecisionQuery></code> element, which is used to request an authorization decision from a trusted third party\n\nThe SAML SOAP binding is often used in conjunction with queries.\n\n====SAML attribute query====\n\nThe ''Attribute Query'' is perhaps the most important type of SAML query.  Often a requester, acting on behalf of the principal, queries an identity provider for attributes.  Below we give an example of a query issued by a principal directly:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:AttributeQuery\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    ID=\"aaf23196-1773-2113-474a-fe114412ab72\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2006-07-17T20:31:40Z\">\n    <saml:Issuer\n      Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName\">\n      CN=trscavo@uiuc.edu,OU=User,O=NCSA-TEST,C=US\n    </saml:Issuer>\n    <saml:Subject>\n      <saml:NameID\n        Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName\">\n        CN=trscavo@uiuc.edu,OU=User,O=NCSA-TEST,C=US\n      </saml:NameID>\n    </saml:Subject>\n    <saml:Attribute\n      NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n      Name=\"urn:oid:2.5.4.42\"\n      FriendlyName=\"givenName\">\n    </saml:Attribute>\n    <saml:Attribute\n      NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n      Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26\"\n      FriendlyName=\"mail\">\n    </saml:Attribute>\n  </samlp:AttributeQuery>\n</source>\n\nNote that the <code>Issuer</code> is the <code>Subject</code> in this case.  This is sometimes called an ''attribute self-query''.

Moreover, since the assertion is signed, the user can push this assertion to a relying party, and as long as the user can prove possession of the corresponding private key (hence the name \"holder-of-key\"), the relying party can be assured that the assertion is authentic.\n\n==SAML 2.0 metadata==\n\nQuite literally, metadata is what makes SAML work (or work well).  Some important uses of metadata include:\n\n* A service provider prepares to transmit a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element to an identity provider via the browser.  How does the service provider know the identity provider is authentic and not some evil identity provider trying to [[phishing|phish]] the user's password?  The service provider consults its list of trusted identity providers <strong>in metadata</strong> before issuing an authentication request.\n* In the previous scenario, how does the service provider know where to send the user with the authentication request?  The service provider looks up a pre-arranged endpoint location of the trusted identity provider <strong>in metadata</strong>.\n* An identity provider receives a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element from a service provider via the browser.  How does the identity provider know the service provider is authentic and not some evil service provider trying to harvest [[personally identifiable information]] regarding the user?  The identity provider consults its list of trusted service providers <strong>in metadata</strong> before issuing an authentication response.\n* In the previous scenario, how does the identity provider encrypt the SAML assertion so that the trusted service provider (and only the trusted service provider) can decrypt the assertion. The identity provider uses the service provider's encryption certificate <strong>in metadata</strong> to encrypt the assertion.\n* Continuing with the previous scenario, how does the identity provider know where to send the user with the authentication response?  The identity provider looks up a pre-arranged endpoint location of the trusted service provider <strong>in metadata</strong>.\n* How does the service provider know that the authentication response came from a trusted identity provider?  The service provider verifies the signature on the assertion using the public key of the identity provider <strong>from metadata</strong>.\n* How does the service provider know where to resolve an artifact received from a trusted identity provider?  The service provider looks up the pre-arranged endpoint location of the identity provider's artifact resolution service <strong>from metadata</strong>.\n\nMetadata ensures a secure transaction between an identity provider and a service provider.  Before metadata, trust information was encoded into the implementation in a proprietary manner.  Now the sharing of trust information is facilitated by standard metadata.  SAML&nbsp;2.0 provides a well-defined, interoperable metadata format that entities can leverage to bootstrap the trust process.\n\n===Identity Provider Metadata===\n\nAn identity provider publishes data about itself in an <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2\" validUntil=\"2013-03-22T23:00:00Z\"\n    xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n    <!-- insert ds:Signature element (omitted) -->\n    <!-- insert md:IDPSSODescriptor element (below) -->\n    <md:Organization>\n      <md:OrganizationName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Non-profit Organization of New York</md:OrganizationName>\n      <md:OrganizationDisplayName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Non-profit Organization</md:OrganizationDisplayName>\n      <md:OrganizationURL xml:lang=\"en\">https://www.example.org/</md:OrganizationURL>\n    </md:Organization>\n    <md:ContactPerson contactType=\"technical\">\n      <md:SurName>SAML Technical Support</md:SurName>\n      <md:EmailAddress>mailto:saml-support@example.org</md:EmailAddress>\n    </md:ContactPerson>\n  </md:EntityDescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about this entity descriptor:\n\n* The <code>entityID</code> attribute is the unique identifier of the entity.\n* The <code>validUntil</code> attribute gives the expiration date of the metadata.\n* The <code><ds:Signature></code> element (which has been omitted for simplicity) contains a digital signature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of the metadata.\n* The organization identified in the <code><md:Organization></code> element is \"responsible for the entity\" described by the entity descriptor (section&nbsp;2.3.2 of SAMLMeta<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>).\n* The contact information in the <code><md:ContactPerson></code> element identifies a technical contact responsible for the entity. Multiple contacts and contact types are possible. See section&nbsp;2.3.2.2 of SAMLMeta.<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>\n\nBy definition, an identity provider manages an SSO service that supports the SAML Web Browser SSO profile specified in SAMLProf.<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/> See, for example, the identity provider described in the <code><md:IDPSSODescriptor></code> element shown in the next section.\n\n====SSO service metadata====\n\nThe SSO service at the identity provider is described in an <code><md:IDPSSODescriptor></code> element:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:IDPSSODescriptor\n    protocolSupportEnumeration=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\">\n    <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\">\n      <ds:KeyInfo>...</ds:KeyInfo>\n    </md:KeyDescriptor>\n    <md:ArtifactResolutionService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"0\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/ArtifactResolution\"/>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:SingleSignOnService\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect\"/>\n    <md:SingleSignOnService\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/POST\"/>\n    <md:SingleSignOnService\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/Artifact\"/>\n    <saml:Attribute\n      NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n      Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1\"\n      FriendlyName=\"eduPersonAffiliation\">\n      <saml:AttributeValue>member</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>student</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>faculty</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>employee</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>staff</saml:AttributeValue>\n    </saml:Attribute>\n  </md:IDPSSODescriptor>\n</source>\nThe previous metadata element describes the SSO service at the identity provider.

The corresponding public key is included in the <code><md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\"></code> element in IdP metadata. The key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity.\n* The <code>Binding</code> attribute of the <code><md:ArtifactResolutionService></code> element indicates that the SAML SOAP binding (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>) should be used for artifact resolution.\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:ArtifactResolutionService></code> element is used in step&nbsp;8 of the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile.\n* The value of the <code>index</code> attribute of the <code><md:ArtifactResolutionService></code> element is used as the <code>EndpointIndex</code> in the construction of a SAML type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact.\n* The <code><md:NameIDFormat></code> elements indicate what SAML name identifier formats (SAMLCore<ref name=\"SAMLCore\"/>) the SSO service supports.\n* The <code>Binding</code> attributes of the <code><md:SingleSignOnService></code> elements are standard URIs specified in the SAML&nbsp;2.0 Binding specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>).\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:SingleSignOnService></code> element that supports the HTTP POST binding is used in step&nbsp;2 of the \"[[#SP POST Request; IdP POST Response|double POST]]\" profile.\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:SingleSignOnService></code> element that supports the HTTP Artifact binding is used in step&nbsp;2 of the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile.\n* The <code><saml:Attribute></code> element describes an attribute that the identity provider is willing to assert (subject to policy).  The <code><saml:AttributeValue></code> elements enumerate the possible values the attribute may take on.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this section, the values of the <code>Location</code> attributes are used by a service provider to route SAML messages, which minimizes the possibility of a rogue identity provider orchestrating a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].\n\n===Service provider metadata===\n\nLike the identity provider, a service provider publishes data about itself in an <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2\" validUntil=\"2013-03-22T23:00:00Z\"\n    xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n    <!-- insert ds:Signature element (omitted) -->\n    <!-- insert md:SPSSODescriptor element (see below) -->\n    <md:Organization>\n      <md:OrganizationName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Commercial Vendor of California</md:OrganizationName>\n      <md:OrganizationDisplayName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Commercial Vendor</md:OrganizationDisplayName>\n      <md:OrganizationURL xml:lang=\"en\">https://www.example.com/</md:OrganizationURL>\n    </md:Organization>\n    <md:ContactPerson contactType=\"technical\">\n      <md:SurName>SAML Technical Support</md:SurName>\n      <md:EmailAddress>mailto:saml-support@example.com</md:EmailAddress>\n    </md:ContactPerson>\n  </md:EntityDescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about this entity descriptor:\n\n* The <code>entityID</code> attribute is the unique identifier of the entity.\n* The <code>validUntil</code> attribute gives the expiration date of the metadata.\n* The <code><ds:Signature></code> element (which has been omitted for simplicity) contains a digital signature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of the metadata.\n* The organization identified in the <code><md:Organization></code> element is \"responsible for the entity\" described by the entity descriptor (section&nbsp;2.3.2 of SAMLMeta<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>).\n* The contact information in the <code><md:ContactPerson></code> element identifies a technical contact responsible for the entity. Multiple contacts and contact types are possible. See section&nbsp;2.3.2.2 of SAMLMeta.<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>\n\nBy definition, a service provider manages an assertion consumer service that supports the SAML Web Browser SSO profile specified in SAMLProf.<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/> See, for example, the service provider described in the <code><md:SPSSODescriptor></code> element shown in the next section.\n\n====Assertion consumer service metadata====\n\nThe assertion consumer service is contained in an <code><md:SPSSODescriptor></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:SPSSODescriptor\n    protocolSupportEnumeration=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\">\n    <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\">\n      <ds:KeyInfo>...</ds:KeyInfo>\n    </md:KeyDescriptor>\n    <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"encryption\">\n      <ds:KeyInfo>...</ds:KeyInfo>\n    </md:KeyDescriptor>\n    <md:ArtifactResolutionService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"0\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP\"\n      Location=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/ArtifactResolution\"/>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:AssertionConsumerService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"0\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\"\n      Location=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"/>\n    <md:AssertionConsumerService index=\"1\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact\"\n      Location=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/Artifact\"/>\n    <md:AttributeConsumingService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"1\">\n      <md:ServiceName xml:lang=\"en\">Service Provider Portal</md:ServiceName>\n      <md:RequestedAttribute\n        NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n        Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1\"\n        FriendlyName=\"eduPersonAffiliation\">\n      </md:RequestedAttribute>\n    </md:AttributeConsumingService>\n  </md:SPSSODescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about the <code><md:SPSSODescriptor></code> metadata element:\n\n* The service provider software is configured with a private SAML signing key and/or a private back-channel TLS key. The corresponding public key is included in the <code><md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\"></code> element in SP metadata. The key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity.\n* Likewise the service provider software is configured with a private SAML decryption key. A public SAML encryption key is included in the <code><md:KeyDescriptor use=\"encryption\"></code> element in SP metadata. The key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity.\n* The <code>index</code> attribute of an <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> element is used as the value of the <code>AssertionConsumerServiceIndex</code> attribute in a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element.\n* The <code>Binding</code> attributes of the <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> elements are standard URIs specified in the SAML&nbsp;2.0 Binding specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>).\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> element that supports the HTTP POST binding (<code>index=\"0\"</code>) is used in step&nbsp;4 of the \"[[#SP POST Request; IdP POST Response|double POST]]\" profile.\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> element that supports the HTTP Artifact binding (<code>index=\"1\"</code>) is used in step&nbsp;6 of the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile.\n* The <code><md:AttributeConsumingService></code> element is used by the identity provider to formulate an <code><saml:AttributeStatement></code> element that is pushed to the service provider in conjunction with Web Browser SSO.\n* The <code>index</code> attribute of the <code><md:AttributeConsumingService></code> element is used as the value of the <code>AttributeConsumingServiceIndex</code> attribute in a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this section, the values of the <code>Location</code> attributes are used by an identity provider to route SAML messages, which minimizes the possibility of a rogue service provider orchestrating a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].\n\n===Metadata aggregates===\n\nIn the previous examples, each <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> element is shown to be digitally signed. In practice, however, multiple <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> elements are grouped together under an <code><md:EntitiesDescriptor></code> element with a single digital signature over the entire aggregate:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:EntitiesDescriptor validUntil=\"2013-03-22T23:00:00Z\"\n    xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n    <!-- insert ds:Signature element (omitted) -->\n    <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2\">\n      ...\n    </md:EntityDescriptor>\n    <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2\">\n      ...\n    </md:EntityDescriptor>\n  </md:EntitiesDescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about the above <code><md:EntitiesDescriptor></code> element:\n\n* The digital signature (which has been omitted for brevity) covers the entire aggregate.\n* The <code>validUntil</code> XML attribute has been elevated to the parent element, implying that the expiration date applies to each child element.\n* The XML namespace declarations have been elevated to the parent element to avoid redundant namespace declarations.\n\nTypically metadata aggregates are published by trusted third parties called ''federations'' who vouch for the integrity of all the metadata in the aggregate. Note that metadata aggregates can be very large, composed of hundreds or even thousands of entities per aggregate.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Security Assertion Markup Language]]\n* [[SAML 1.1]]\n* [[SAML metadata]]\n* [[SAML-based products and services]]\n* [[OpenID Connect]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Primary references:'''\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"SAMLCore\">S.&nbsp;Cantor et al.

SAML&nbsp;2.0 is an [[XML]]-based [[communications protocol|protocol]] that uses [[software token|security tokens]] containing [[Security Assertion Markup Language|assertions]] to pass information about a principal (usually an end user) between a SAML authority, named an [[Identity Provider]], and a SAML consumer, named a [[Service Provider]].  SAML&nbsp;2.0 enables web-based, cross-domain [[single sign-on]] (SSO), which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing multiple authentication tokens to the user.\n\nSAML&nbsp;2.0 was ratified as an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] Standard in March 2005, replacing [[SAML 1.1]].  The critical aspects of SAML&nbsp;2.0 are covered in detail in the official documents SAMLCore,<ref name=\"SAMLCore\"/> SAMLBind,<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/> SAMLProf,<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/> and SAMLMeta.<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>\n\nSome 30 individuals from more than 24 companies and organizations were involved in the creation of SAML&nbsp;2.0.  In particular, and of special note, [[Liberty Alliance]] donated its Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) specification to OASIS, which became the basis of the SAML&nbsp;2.0 specification.  Thus SAML&nbsp;2.0 represents the convergence of [[SAML 1.1]], [http://www.projectliberty.org/resource_center/specifications/liberty_alliance_id_ff_1_2_specifications Liberty ID-FF&nbsp;1.2], and [http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/docs/internet2-mace-shibboleth-arch-protocols-200509.pdf Shibboleth&nbsp;1.3].\n\n==SAML 2.0 assertions==\n\nAn assertion is a package of information that supplies zero or more statements made by a SAML authority. SAML assertions are usually made about a subject, represented by the <code><Subject></code> element. The SAML 2.0 specification defines three different kinds of assertion statements that can be created by a SAML authority. All SAML-defined statements are associated with a subject. The three kinds of statements defined are as follows:\n* Authentication Assertion: The assertion subject was authenticated by a particular means at a particular time.\n* Attribute Assertion: The assertion subject is associated with the supplied attributes.\n* Authorization Decision Assertion: A request to allow the assertion subject to access the specified resource has been granted or denied.\n\nAn important type of SAML assertion is the so-called <span id=\"BearerAssertion\">\"bearer\" assertion</span> used to facilitate Web Browser SSO.  Here is an example of a short-lived bearer assertion issued by an identity provider (<nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</nowiki>) to a service provider (<nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</nowiki>).  The assertion includes both an Authentication Assertion <code><saml:AuthnStatement></code> and an Attribute Assertion <code><saml:AttributeStatement></code>, which presumably the service provider uses to make an access control decision. The prefix <code>saml:</code> represents the SAML V2.0 assertion namespace.\n\n=== Example of SAML ===\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<saml:Assertion\n   xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n   xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n   ID=\"_d71a3a8e9fcc45c9e9d248ef7049393fc8f04e5f75\"\n   Version=\"2.0\"\n   IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\">\n   <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n   <ds:Signature\n     xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n   <saml:Subject>\n     <saml:NameID\n       Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\">\n       3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8\n     </saml:NameID>\n     <saml:SubjectConfirmation\n       Method=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\">\n       <saml:SubjectConfirmationData\n         InResponseTo=\"aaf23196-1773-2113-474a-fe114412ab72\"\n         Recipient=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"\n         NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\"/>\n     </saml:SubjectConfirmation>\n   </saml:Subject>\n   <saml:Conditions\n     NotBefore=\"2004-12-05T09:17:05Z\"\n     NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\">\n     <saml:AudienceRestriction>\n       <saml:Audience>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Audience>\n     </saml:AudienceRestriction>\n   </saml:Conditions>\n   <saml:AuthnStatement\n     AuthnInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\"\n     SessionIndex=\"b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac\">\n     <saml:AuthnContext>\n       <saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport\n       </saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n     </saml:AuthnContext>\n   </saml:AuthnStatement>\n   <saml:AttributeStatement>\n     <saml:Attribute\n       xmlns:x500=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:attribute:X500\"\n       x500:Encoding=\"LDAP\"\n       NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n       Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1\"\n       FriendlyName=\"eduPersonAffiliation\">\n       <saml:AttributeValue\n         xsi:type=\"xs:string\">member</saml:AttributeValue>\n       <saml:AttributeValue\n         xsi:type=\"xs:string\">staff</saml:AttributeValue>\n     </saml:Attribute>\n   </saml:AttributeStatement>\n </saml:Assertion>\n</source>\n\nNote that in the above example the <code><saml:Assertion></code> element contains the following child elements:\n\n* a <code><saml:Issuer></code> element, which contains the unique identifier of the identity provider\n* a <code><ds:Signature></code> element, which contains an integrity-preserving digital signature (not shown) over the <code><saml:Assertion></code> element\n* a <code><saml:Subject></code> element, which identifies the authenticated principal (but in this case the identity of the principal is hidden behind an opaque transient identifier, for reasons of privacy)\n* a <code><saml:Conditions></code> element, which gives the conditions under which the assertion is to be considered ''valid''\n* a <code><saml:AuthnStatement></code> element, which describes the act of authentication at the identity provider\n* a <code><saml:AttributeStatement></code> element, which asserts a multi-valued attribute associated with the authenticated principal\n\nIn words, the assertion encodes the following information:\n\n<blockquote>The assertion (\"b07b804c-7c29-ea16-7300-4f3d6f7928ac\") was issued at time \"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\" by identity provider (<nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</nowiki>) regarding subject (3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8) exclusively for service provider (<nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</nowiki>).</blockquote>\n\nThe authentication statement, in particular, asserts the following:\n\n<blockquote>The principal identified in the <code><saml:Subject></code> element was authenticated at time \"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\" by means of a password sent over a protected channel.</blockquote>\n\nLikewise the attribute statement asserts that:\n\n<blockquote>The principal identified in the <code><saml:Subject></code> element is a staff member at this institution.</blockquote>\n\n==SAML 2.0 protocols==\n\nThe following protocols are specified in SAMLCore:<ref name=\"SAMLCore\"/>\n\n* Assertion Query and Request Protocol\n* [[#Authentication Request Protocol|Authentication Request Protocol]]\n* [[#Artifact Resolution Protocol|Artifact Resolution Protocol]]\n* Name Identifier Management Protocol\n* Single Logout Protocol\n* Name Identifier Mapping Protocol\n\nThe most important of these protocols&mdash;the Authentication Request Protocol&mdash;is discussed in detail below.\n\n===Authentication Request Protocol===\n\nIn [[SAML 1.1]] Web Browser SSO Profiles are initiated by the [[Identity provider|Identity Provider (IDP)]], that is, an unsolicited <code><samlp:Response></code> element is transmitted from the identity provider to the service provider (via the browser). (The prefix <code>samlp:</code> denotes the SAML protocol namespace.) \n\nIn SAML&nbsp;2.0, however, the flow begins at the service provider who issues an explicit authentication request to the identity provider.  The resulting ''Authentication Request Protocol'' is a significant new feature of SAML&nbsp;2.0.\n\nWhen a principal (or an entity acting on the principal's behalf) wishes to obtain an assertion containing an authentication statement, a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element is transmitted to the identity provider:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:AuthnRequest\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"aaf23196-1773-2113-474a-fe114412ab72\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\"\n    AssertionConsumerServiceIndex=\"0\"\n    AttributeConsumingServiceIndex=\"0\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:NameIDPolicy\n      AllowCreate=\"true\"\n      Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\"/>\n  </samlp:AuthnRequest>\n</source>\nThe above <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element, which implicitly requests [[#SAML 2.0 Assertions|an assertion containing an authentication statement]], was evidently issued by a service provider (<nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</nowiki>) and subsequently presented to the identity provider (via the browser).  The identity provider authenticates the principal (if necessary) and issues an authentication response, which is transmitted back to the service provider (again via the browser).\n\n===Artifact Resolution Protocol===\n\nA SAML message is transmitted from one entity to another either ''by value'' or ''by reference''.  A reference to a SAML message is called an ''artifact''.  The receiver of an artifact resolves the reference by sending a <code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> request directly to the issuer of the artifact, who then responds with the actual message referenced by the artifact.\n\nSuppose, for example, that an identity provider sends the following <span id=\"ArtifactResolveRequest\"><code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> request</span> directly to a service provider (via a back channel):\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:ArtifactResolve\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"_cce4ee769ed970b501d680f697989d14\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:58Z\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <!-- an ArtifactResolve message SHOULD be signed -->\n    <ds:Signature\n      xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n    <samlp:Artifact>AAQAAMh48/1oXIM+sDo7Dh2qMp1HM4IF5DaRNmDj6RdUmllwn9jJHyEgIi8=</samlp:Artifact>\n  </samlp:ArtifactResolve>\n</source>\nIn response, the service provider returns the SAML element referenced by the enclosed artifact.  This protocol forms the basis of the [[#HTTP Artifact Binding|HTTP Artifact Binding]].\n\n==SAML 2.0 bindings==\n\nThe ''bindings'' supported by SAML&nbsp;2.0 are outlined in the Bindings specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>):\n\n* SAML SOAP Binding (based on SOAP&nbsp;1.1)\n* Reverse SOAP (PAOS) Binding\n* [[#HTTP Redirect Binding|HTTP Redirect Binding]]\n* [[#HTTP POST Binding|HTTP POST Binding]]\n* [[#HTTP Artifact Binding|HTTP Artifact Binding]]\n* SAML URI Binding\n\nFor Web Browser SSO, the HTTP Redirect Binding and the HTTP POST Binding are commonly used.  For example, the service provider may use HTTP Redirect to send a request while the identity provider uses HTTP POST to transmit the response.  This example illustrates that an entity's choice of binding is independent of its partner's choice of binding.\n\n===HTTP Redirect Binding===\n\nSAML protocol messages can be carried directly in the URL query string of an HTTP GET request. Since the length of URLs is limited in practice, the HTTP Redirect binding is suitable for short messages, such as the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message. Longer messages (e.g. those containing signed or encrypted SAML assertions, such as SAML Responses) are usually transmitted via other bindings such as the [[#HTTP POST Binding|HTTP POST Binding]].\n\nSAML requests or responses transmitted via HTTP Redirect have a <code>SAMLRequest</code> or <code>SAMLResponse</code> query string parameter, respectively. Before it's sent, the message is deflated (without header and checksum), [[base64]]-encoded, and URL-encoded, in that order. Upon receipt, the process is reversed to recover the original message.\n\nFor example, encoding the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message above yields:\n\n  <nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=fZFfa8IwFMXfBb9DyXvaJtZ1BqsURRC2\n Mabbw95ivc5Am3TJrXPffmmLY3%2FA15Pzuyf33On8XJXBCaxTRmeEhTEJQBdmr%2FRbRp63K3pL5rPhYOpkVdY\n ib%2FCon%2BC9AYfDQRB4WDvRvWWksVoY6ZQTWlbgBBZik9%2FfCR7GorYGTWFK8pu6DknnwKL%2FWEetlxmR8s\n BHbHJDWZqOKGdsRJM0kfQAjCUJ43KX8s78ctnIz%2Blp5xpYa4dSo1fjOKGM03i8jSeCMzGevHa2%2FBK5MNo1F\n dgN2JMqPLmHc0b6WTmiVbsGoTf5qv66Zq2t60x0wXZ2RKydiCJXh3CWVV1CWJgqanfl0%2Bin8xutxYOvZL18NK\n UqPlvZR5el%2BVhYkAgZQdsA6fWVsZXE63W2itrTQ2cVaKV2CjSSqL1v9P%2FAXv4C</nowiki>\n\nThe above message (formatted for readability) may be signed for additional security. In practice, all the data contained in a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code>, such as <code>Issuer</code> which contains the SP ID, and <code>NameIDPolicy</code>, has been agreed between IdP and SP beforehand (via manual information exchange or via [[#SAML 2.0 Metadata|SAML metadata]]). In that case signing the request is not a security constraint. When the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> contains information not known by the IdP beforehand, such as Assertion Consumer Service URL, signing the request is recommended for security purposes.\n\n===HTTP POST Binding===\n\nIn the following example, both the service provider and the identity provider use an HTTP POST binding.  Initially, the service provider responds to a request from the [[user agent]] with a document containing an XHTML form:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n  <form method=\"post\" action=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/POST\" ...>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLRequest\" value=\"''request''\" />\n    ... other input parameter....\n  </form>\n</source>\nThe value of the <code>SAMLRequest</code> parameter is the base64-encoding of a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element, which is transmitted to the identity provider via the browser.  The SSO service at the identity provider validates the request and responds with a document containing another XHTML form:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n  <form method=\"post\" action=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\" ...>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLResponse\" value=\"''response''\" />\n    ...\n  </form>\n</source>\nThe value of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> parameter is the base64 encoding of a <code><samlp:Response></code> element, which likewise is transmitted to the service provider via the browser.\n\nTo automate the submission of the form, the following line of JavaScript may appear anywhere on the XHTML page:\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n  window.onload = function () { document.forms[0].submit(); }\n</source>\nThis assumes, of course, that the first form element in the page contains the above SAMLResponse containing <code>form</code> element (<code>forms[0]</code>).\n\n===HTTP Artifact Binding===\n\nThe HTTP Artifact Binding uses the [[#Artifact Resolution Protocol|Artifact Resolution Protocol]] and the SAML SOAP Binding (over HTTP) to resolve a SAML message by reference.  Consider the following specific example.  Suppose a service provider wants to send a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message to an identity provider.  Initially, the service provider transmits an artifact to the identity provider via an HTTP redirect:\n\n  <nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Artifact</nowiki>?SAMLart=''artifact''\n\nNext the identity provider sends a <code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> request (such as the [[#ArtifactResolveRequest|ArtifactResolveRequest]] shown earlier) directly to the service provider via a back channel.  Finally, the service provider returns a <code><samlp:ArtifactResponse></code> element containing the referenced <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> message:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:ArtifactResponse\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    ID=\"_d84a49e5958803dedcff4c984c2b0d95\"\n    InResponseTo=\"_cce4ee769ed970b501d680f697989d14\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\">\n    <!-- an ArtifactResponse message SHOULD be signed -->\n    <ds:Signature\n      xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n    <samlp:Status>\n      <samlp:StatusCode\n        Value=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success\"/>\n    </samlp:Status>\n    <samlp:AuthnRequest\n      xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n      xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n      ID=\"_306f8ec5b618f361c70b6ffb1480eade\"\n      Version=\"2.0\"\n      IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\"\n      Destination=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Artifact\"\n      ProtocolBinding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact\"\n      AssertionConsumerServiceURL=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/Artifact\">\n      <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n      <samlp:NameIDPolicy\n        AllowCreate=\"false\"\n        Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\"/>\n    </samlp:AuthnRequest>\n  </samlp:ArtifactResponse>\n</source>\n\nOf course the flow can go in the other direction as well, that is, the identity provider may issue an artifact, and in fact this is more common.  See, for example, the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile example later in this topic.\n\n====Artifact format====\n\nIn general, a SAML&nbsp;2.0 ''artifact'' is defined as follows (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>):\n\n  SAML_artifact := B64 (TypeCode EndpointIndex RemainingArtifact)\n  TypeCode      := Byte1Byte2\n  EndpointIndex := Byte1Byte2\n\nThus a SAML&nbsp;2.0 artifact consists of three components: a two-byte <code>TypeCode</code>, a two-byte <code>EndpointIndex</code>, and an arbitrary sequence of bytes called the <code>RemainingArtifact</code>.  These three pieces of information are concatenated and base64-encoded to yield the complete artifact.\n\nThe <code>TypeCode</code> uniquely identifies the artifact format.  SAML&nbsp;2.0 predefines just one such artifact, of type&nbsp;0x0004.  The <code>EndpointIndex</code> is a reference to a particular artifact resolution endpoint managed by the artifact issuer (which may be either the IdP or the SP, as mentioned earlier).  The <code>RemainingArtifact</code>, which is determined by the type definition, is the \"meat\" of the artifact.\n\nThe format of a ''type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact'' is further defined as follows:\n\n  TypeCode            := 0x0004\n  RemainingArtifact   := SourceId MessageHandle\n  SourceId            := 20-byte_sequence\n  MessageHandle       := 20-byte_sequence\n\nThus a type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact is of size 44&nbsp;bytes (unencoded).  The <code>SourceId</code> is an arbitrary sequence of bytes, although in practice, the <code>SourceId</code> is the SHA-1 hash of the issuer's entityID.  The <code>MessageHandle</code> is a random sequence of bytes that references a SAML message that the artifact issuer is willing to produce on-demand.\n\nFor example, consider this hex-encoded type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact:\n\n  00040000c878f3fd685c833eb03a3b0e1daa329d47338205e436913660e3e917549a59709fd8c91f2120222f\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the <code>TypeCode</code> (0x0004) and the <code>EndpointIndex</code> (0x0000) at the front of the artifact.  The next 20&nbsp;bytes are the SHA-1 hash of the issuer's entityID (<nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</nowiki>) followed by 20 random bytes.  The base64-encoding of these 44&nbsp;bytes is what you see in the [[#ArtifactResolveRequest|ArtifactResolveRequest]] example above.\n\n==SAML 2.0 profiles==\n\nIn SAML&nbsp;2.0, as in SAML&nbsp;1.1, the primary use case is still Web Browser SSO, but the scope of SAML&nbsp;2.0 is broader than previous versions of SAML, as suggested in the following exhaustive list of profiles:\n\n* SSO Profiles\n** [[#Web_browser_SSO_Profile|Web browser SSO Profile]]\n** Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) Profile\n** [[#Identity_Provider_Discovery_Profile|Identity Provider Discovery Profile]]\n** Single Logout Profile\n** Name Identifier Management Profile\n* Artifact Resolution Profile\n* [[#Assertion_Query/Request_Profile|Assertion Query/Request Profile]]\n* Name Identifier Mapping Profile\n* SAML Attribute Profiles\n** Basic Attribute Profile\n** X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile\n** UUID Attribute Profile\n** DCE PAC Attribute Profile\n** XACML Attribute Profile\n\nAlthough the number of supported profiles is quite large, the Profiles specification (SAMLProf<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/>) is simplified since the binding aspects of each profile have been factored out into a separate Bindings specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>).\n\n===Web browser SSO profile===\n\nSAML&nbsp;2.0 specifies a ''Web Browser SSO Profile'' involving an identity provider (IdP), a service provider (SP), and a principal wielding an HTTP user agent.  The service provider has four bindings from which to choose while the identity provider has three, which leads to twelve (12) possible deployment scenarios.  We outline three of those deployment scenarios below.\n\n====SP redirect request; IdP POST response====\n\nThis is one of the most common scenarios. The service provider sends a SAML Request to the IdP SSO Service using the HTTP-Redirect Binding. The identity provider returns the SAML Response to the SP Assertion Consumer Service using the HTTP-POST Binding.\n\n[[File:Saml2-browser-sso-redirect-post.png|thumb|none|700px|SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO (SP Redirect Bind/ IdP POST Response)]]\n\nThe message flow begins with a request for a secured resource at the service provider.\n\n'''1. Request the target resource at the SP'''\n\nThe principal (via an HTTP user agent) requests a target resource at the service provider:\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/myresource</nowiki>\n\nThe service provider performs a security check on behalf of the target resource.  If a valid security context at the service provider already exists, skip steps 2&ndash;7.\n\nThe service provider may use any kind of mechanism to discover the identity provider that will be used, e.g., ask the user, use a preconfigured IdP, etc.\n\n'''2. Redirect to IdP SSO Service'''\n\nThe service provider generates an appropriate SAMLRequest (and RelayState, if any), then redirects the browser to the IdP SSO Service using a standard [[HTTP 302]] redirect.\n\n<source lang=\"http\">\n302 Redirect\nLocation: https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=request&RelayState=token\n</source>\n\nThe <code>RelayState</code> token is an opaque reference to state information maintained at the service provider.  The value of the <code>SAMLRequest</code> parameter is a deflated, base64-encoded and URL-encoded value of an <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:AuthnRequest\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"identifier_1\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:59Z\"\n    AssertionConsumerServiceIndex=\"0\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:NameIDPolicy\n      AllowCreate=\"true\"\n      Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\"/>\n  </samlp:AuthnRequest>\n</source>\n\nThe SAMLRequest may be signed using the SP signing key. Typically, however, this is not necessary.\n\n'''3. Request the SSO Service at the IdP'''\n\nThe user agent issues a GET request to the SSO service at the identity provider:\n\n<source lang=\"http\" highlight=\"6\">\nGET /SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest=request&RelayState=token HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.example.org\n</source>\n\nwhere the values of the <code>SAMLRequest</code> and <code>RelayState</code> parameters are the same as those provided in the redirect.  The SSO Service at the identity provider processes the <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element (by URL-decoding, base64-decoding and inflating the request, in that order) and performs a security check.  If the user does not have a valid security context, the identity provider identifies the user with any mechanism (details omitted).\n\n'''4. Respond with an XHTML form'''\n\nThe SSO Service validates the request and responds with a document containing an XHTML form:\n\n<source lang=\"html\" highlight=\"2-3\">\n  <form method=\"post\" action=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\" ...>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLResponse\" value=\"response\" />\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"RelayState\" value=\"token\" />\n    ...\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n  </form>\n</source>\n\nThe value of the <code>RelayState</code> parameter has been preserved from step&nbsp;3.  The value of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> parameter is the base64 encoding of the following <code><samlp:Response></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:Response\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"identifier_2\"\n    InResponseTo=\"identifier_1\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\"\n    Destination=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:Status>\n      <samlp:StatusCode\n        Value=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success\"/>\n    </samlp:Status>\n    <saml:Assertion\n      xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n      ID=\"identifier_3\"\n      Version=\"2.0\"\n      IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\">\n      <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n      <!-- a POSTed assertion MUST be signed -->\n      <ds:Signature\n        xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n      <saml:Subject>\n        <saml:NameID\n          Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\">\n          3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8\n        </saml:NameID>\n        <saml:SubjectConfirmation\n          Method=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\">\n          <saml:SubjectConfirmationData\n            InResponseTo=\"identifier_1\"\n            Recipient=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"\n            NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\"/>\n        </saml:SubjectConfirmation>\n      </saml:Subject>\n      <saml:Conditions\n        NotBefore=\"2004-12-05T09:17:05Z\"\n        NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\">\n        <saml:AudienceRestriction>\n          <saml:Audience>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Audience>\n        </saml:AudienceRestriction>\n      </saml:Conditions>\n      <saml:AuthnStatement\n        AuthnInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\"\n        SessionIndex=\"identifier_3\">\n        <saml:AuthnContext>\n          <saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n            urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport\n         </saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n        </saml:AuthnContext>\n      </saml:AuthnStatement>\n    </saml:Assertion>\n  </samlp:Response>\n</source>\n\n'''5. Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP'''\n\nThe user agent issues a POST request to the Assertion Consumer Service at the service provider:\n\n<source lang=\"http\" highlight=\"6\">\nPOST /SAML2/SSO/POST HTTP/1.1\nHost: sp.example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: nnn\n \nSAMLResponse=response&RelayState=token\n</source>\n\nwhere the values of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> and <code>RelayState</code> parameters are taken from the XHTML form at step&nbsp;4.\n\n'''6. Redirect to the target resource'''\n\nThe assertion consumer service processes the response, creates a security context at the service provider and redirects the user agent to the target resource.\n\n'''7. Request the target resource at the SP again'''\n\nThe user agent requests the target resource at the service provider (again):\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/myresource</nowiki>\n\n'''8. Respond with requested resource'''\n\nSince a security context exists, the service provider returns the resource to the user agent.\n\n====SP POST Request; IdP POST Response====\n\nThis is a relatively simple deployment of the SAML&nbsp;2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile (SAMLProf<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/>) where both the service provider (SP) and the identity provider (IdP) use the HTTP POST binding.\n\n[[File:Saml2-browser-sso-post.gif|frame|center|SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO (POST)]]\n\nThe message flow begins with a request for a secured resource at the SP.\n\n'''1.

The value of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> parameter is the base64 encoding of the following <code><samlp:Response></code> element:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:Response\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"identifier_2\"\n    InResponseTo=\"identifier_1\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\"\n    Destination=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <samlp:Status>\n      <samlp:StatusCode\n        Value=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success\"/>\n    </samlp:Status>\n    <saml:Assertion\n      xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n      ID=\"identifier_3\"\n      Version=\"2.0\"\n      IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:05Z\">\n      <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n      <!-- a POSTed assertion MUST be signed -->\n      <ds:Signature\n        xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n      <saml:Subject>\n        <saml:NameID\n          Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\">\n          3f7b3dcf-1674-4ecd-92c8-1544f346baf8\n        </saml:NameID>\n        <saml:SubjectConfirmation\n          Method=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\">\n          <saml:SubjectConfirmationData\n            InResponseTo=\"identifier_1\"\n            Recipient=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"\n            NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\"/>\n        </saml:SubjectConfirmation>\n      </saml:Subject>\n      <saml:Conditions\n        NotBefore=\"2004-12-05T09:17:05Z\"\n        NotOnOrAfter=\"2004-12-05T09:27:05Z\">\n        <saml:AudienceRestriction>\n          <saml:Audience>https://sp.example.com/SAML2</saml:Audience>\n        </saml:AudienceRestriction>\n      </saml:Conditions>\n      <saml:AuthnStatement\n        AuthnInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:22:00Z\"\n        SessionIndex=\"identifier_3\">\n        <saml:AuthnContext>\n          <saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n            urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport\n         </saml:AuthnContextClassRef>\n        </saml:AuthnContext>\n      </saml:AuthnStatement>\n    </saml:Assertion>\n  </samlp:Response>\n</source>\n'''5. Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP'''\n\nThe user agent issues a POST request to the assertion consumer service at the service provider:\n<source lang=\"http\" highlight=\"6\">\nPOST /SAML2/SSO/POST HTTP/1.1\nHost: sp.example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: nnn\n \nSAMLResponse=response&RelayState=token\n</source>\nwhere the values of the <code>SAMLResponse</code> and <code>RelayState</code> parameters are taken from the XHTML form at step&nbsp;4.\n\n'''6. Redirect to the target resource'''\n\nThe assertion consumer service processes the response, creates a security context at the service provider and redirects the user agent to the target resource.\n\n'''7. Request the target resource at the SP again'''\n\nThe user agent requests the target resource at the service provider (again):\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/myresource</nowiki>\n\n'''8. Respond with requested resource'''\n\nSince a security context exists, the service provider returns the resource to the user agent.\n\n====SP redirect artifact; IdP redirect artifact====\n\nThis is a complex deployment of the SAML&nbsp;2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile (SAMLProf<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/>) where both the service provider (SP) and the identity provider (IdP) use the HTTP Artifact binding.  Both artifacts are delivered to their respective endpoints via HTTP GET.\n\n[[File:Saml2-browser-sso-artifact.gif|frame|center|SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO (Artifact)]]\n\nThe message flow begins with a request for a secured resource at the SP:\n\n'''1. Request the target resource at the SP'''\n\nThe principal (via an HTTP user agent) requests a target resource at the service provider:\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/myresource</nowiki>\n\nThe service provider performs a security check on behalf of the target resource.  If a valid security context at the service provider already exists, skip steps 2&ndash;11.\n\n'''2. Redirect to the Single Sign-on (SSO) Service at the IdP'''\n\nThe service provider redirects the user agent to the single sign-on (SSO) service at the identity provider.  A <code>RelayState</code> parameter and a <code>SAMLart</code> parameter are appended to the redirect URL.\n\n'''3. Request the SSO Service at the IdP'''\n\nThe user agent requests the SSO service at the identity provider:\n\n  <nowiki>https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Artifact</nowiki>?SAMLart=''artifact_1''&RelayState=''token''\n\nwhere <code>''token''</code> is an opaque reference to state information maintained at the service provider and <code>''artifact_1''</code> is a SAML artifact, both issued at step&nbsp;2.\n\n'''4. Request the Artifact Resolution Service at the SP'''\n\nThe SSO service dereferences the artifact by sending a <code><samlp:ArtifactResolve></code> element bound to a SAML SOAP message to the artifact resolution service at the service provider:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <samlp:ArtifactResolve\n    xmlns:samlp=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    ID=\"identifier_1\"\n    Version=\"2.0\"\n    IssueInstant=\"2004-12-05T09:21:58Z\"\n    Destination=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/ArtifactResolution\">\n    <saml:Issuer>https://idp.example.org/SAML2</saml:Issuer>\n    <!-- an ArtifactResolve message SHOULD be signed -->\n    <ds:Signature\n      xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">...</ds:Signature>\n    <samlp:Artifact>''artifact_1''</samlp:Artifact>\n  </samlp:ArtifactResolve>\n</source>\nwhere the value of the <code><samlp:Artifact></code> element is the SAML artifact transmitted at step 3.\n\n'''5.

If the user does not have a valid security context, the identity provider identifies the user (details omitted).\n\n'''6. Redirect to the Assertion Consumer Service'''\n\nThe SSO service at the identity provider redirects the user agent to the assertion consumer service at the service provider.  The previous <code>RelayState</code> parameter and a new <code>SAMLart</code> parameter are appended to the redirect URL.\n\n'''7. Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP'''\n\nThe user agent requests the assertion consumer service at the service provider:\n\n  <nowiki>https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/Artifact</nowiki>?SAMLart=''artifact_2''&RelayState=''token''\n\nwhere <code>''token''</code> is the token value from step&nbsp;3 and <code>''artifact_2''</code> is the SAML artifact issued at step&nbsp;6.\n\n'''8.

Respond with the requested resource'''\n\nSince a security context exists, the service provider returns the resource to the user agent.\n\n===Identity provider discovery profile===\n\nThe SAML&nbsp;2.0 ''Identity Provider Discovery Profile'' introduces the following concepts:\n\n* '''Common Domain'''\n* '''Common Domain Cookie'''\n* '''Common Domain Cookie Writing Service'''\n* '''Common Domain Cookie Reading Service'''\n\nAs a hypothetical example of a ''Common Domain'', let's suppose Example UK (example.co.uk) and Example Deutschland (example.de) belong to the virtual organization Example Global Alliance (example.com).  In this example, the domain '''example.com''' is the common domain.  Both Example UK and Example Deutschland have a presence in this domain (uk.example.com and de.example.com, resp.).\n\nThe ''Common Domain Cookie'' is a secure browser cookie scoped to the common domain.  For each browser user, this cookie stores a history list of recently visited IdPs.  The name and value of the cookie are specified in the IdP Discovery Profile (SAMLProf<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/>).\n\nAfter a successful act of authentication, the IdP requests the ''Common Domain Cookie Writing Service''.  This service appends the IdP's unique identifier to the common domain cookie.  The SP, when it receives an unauthenticated request for a protected resource, requests the ''Common Domain Cookie Reading Service'' to discover the browser user's most recently used IdP.\n\n===Assertion query/request profile===\n\nThe ''Assertion Query/Request Profile'' is a general profile that accommodates numerous types of so-called ''queries'' using the following SAML&nbsp;2.0 elements:\n\n* the <code><samlp:AssertionIDRequest></code> element, which is used to request an assertion given its unique identifier (<code>ID</code>)\n* the <code><samlp:SubjectQuery></code> element, which is an abstract extension point that allows new subject-based SAML queries to be defined\n* the <code><samlp:AuthnQuery></code> element, which is used to request '''existing''' authentication assertions about a given subject from an Authentication Authority\n* the <code><samlp:AttributeQuery></code> element, which is used to request attributes about a given subject from an Attribute Authority\n* the <code><samlp:AuthzDecisionQuery></code> element, which is used to request an authorization decision from a trusted third party\n\nThe SAML SOAP binding is often used in conjunction with queries.\n\n====SAML attribute query====\n\nThe ''Attribute Query'' is perhaps the most important type of SAML query.  Often a requester, acting on behalf of the principal, queries an identity provider for attributes.

Moreover, since the assertion is signed, the user can push this assertion to a relying party, and as long as the user can prove possession of the corresponding private key (hence the name \"holder-of-key\"), the relying party can be assured that the assertion is authentic.\n\n==SAML 2.0 metadata==\n\nQuite literally, metadata is what makes SAML work (or work well).  Some important uses of metadata include:\n\n* A service provider prepares to transmit a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element to an identity provider via the browser.  How does the service provider know the identity provider is authentic and not some evil identity provider trying to [[phishing|phish]] the user's password?  The service provider consults its list of trusted identity providers <strong>in metadata</strong> before issuing an authentication request.\n* In the previous scenario, how does the service provider know where to send the user with the authentication request?  The service provider looks up a pre-arranged endpoint location of the trusted identity provider <strong>in metadata</strong>.\n* An identity provider receives a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element from a service provider via the browser.  How does the identity provider know the service provider is authentic and not some evil service provider trying to harvest [[personally identifiable information]] regarding the user?  The identity provider consults its list of trusted service providers <strong>in metadata</strong> before issuing an authentication response.\n* In the previous scenario, how does the identity provider encrypt the SAML assertion so that the trusted service provider (and only the trusted service provider) can decrypt the assertion. The identity provider uses the service provider's encryption certificate <strong>in metadata</strong> to encrypt the assertion.\n* Continuing with the previous scenario, how does the identity provider know where to send the user with the authentication response?  The identity provider looks up a pre-arranged endpoint location of the trusted service provider <strong>in metadata</strong>.\n* How does the service provider know that the authentication response came from a trusted identity provider?  The service provider verifies the signature on the assertion using the public key of the identity provider <strong>from metadata</strong>.\n* How does the service provider know where to resolve an artifact received from a trusted identity provider?  The service provider looks up the pre-arranged endpoint location of the identity provider's artifact resolution service <strong>from metadata</strong>.\n\nMetadata ensures a secure transaction between an identity provider and a service provider.  Before metadata, trust information was encoded into the implementation in a proprietary manner.  Now the sharing of trust information is facilitated by standard metadata.  SAML&nbsp;2.0 provides a well-defined, interoperable metadata format that entities can leverage to bootstrap the trust process.\n\n===Identity Provider Metadata===\n\nAn identity provider publishes data about itself in an <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2\" validUntil=\"2013-03-22T23:00:00Z\"\n    xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n    <!-- insert ds:Signature element (omitted) -->\n    <!-- insert md:IDPSSODescriptor element (below) -->\n    <md:Organization>\n      <md:OrganizationName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Non-profit Organization of New York</md:OrganizationName>\n      <md:OrganizationDisplayName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Non-profit Organization</md:OrganizationDisplayName>\n      <md:OrganizationURL xml:lang=\"en\">https://www.example.org/</md:OrganizationURL>\n    </md:Organization>\n    <md:ContactPerson contactType=\"technical\">\n      <md:SurName>SAML Technical Support</md:SurName>\n      <md:EmailAddress>mailto:saml-support@example.org</md:EmailAddress>\n    </md:ContactPerson>\n  </md:EntityDescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about this entity descriptor:\n\n* The <code>entityID</code> attribute is the unique identifier of the entity.\n* The <code>validUntil</code> attribute gives the expiration date of the metadata.\n* The <code><ds:Signature></code> element (which has been omitted for simplicity) contains a digital signature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of the metadata.\n* The organization identified in the <code><md:Organization></code> element is \"responsible for the entity\" described by the entity descriptor (section&nbsp;2.3.2 of SAMLMeta<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>).\n* The contact information in the <code><md:ContactPerson></code> element identifies a technical contact responsible for the entity. Multiple contacts and contact types are possible. See section&nbsp;2.3.2.2 of SAMLMeta.<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>\n\nBy definition, an identity provider manages an SSO service that supports the SAML Web Browser SSO profile specified in SAMLProf.<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/> See, for example, the identity provider described in the <code><md:IDPSSODescriptor></code> element shown in the next section.\n\n====SSO service metadata====\n\nThe SSO service at the identity provider is described in an <code><md:IDPSSODescriptor></code> element:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:IDPSSODescriptor\n    protocolSupportEnumeration=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\">\n    <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\">\n      <ds:KeyInfo>...</ds:KeyInfo>\n    </md:KeyDescriptor>\n    <md:ArtifactResolutionService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"0\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/ArtifactResolution\"/>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:SingleSignOnService\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect\"/>\n    <md:SingleSignOnService\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/POST\"/>\n    <md:SingleSignOnService\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact\"\n      Location=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2/Artifact\"/>\n    <saml:Attribute\n      NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n      Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1\"\n      FriendlyName=\"eduPersonAffiliation\">\n      <saml:AttributeValue>member</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>student</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>faculty</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>employee</saml:AttributeValue>\n      <saml:AttributeValue>staff</saml:AttributeValue>\n    </saml:Attribute>\n  </md:IDPSSODescriptor>\n</source>\nThe previous metadata element describes the SSO service at the identity provider.  Note the following details about this element:\n\n* The identity provider software is configured with a private SAML signing key and/or a private back-channel TLS key. The corresponding public key is included in the <code><md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\"></code> element in IdP metadata. The key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity.\n* The <code>Binding</code> attribute of the <code><md:ArtifactResolutionService></code> element indicates that the SAML SOAP binding (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>) should be used for artifact resolution.\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:ArtifactResolutionService></code> element is used in step&nbsp;8 of the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile.\n* The value of the <code>index</code> attribute of the <code><md:ArtifactResolutionService></code> element is used as the <code>EndpointIndex</code> in the construction of a SAML type&nbsp;0x0004 artifact.\n* The <code><md:NameIDFormat></code> elements indicate what SAML name identifier formats (SAMLCore<ref name=\"SAMLCore\"/>) the SSO service supports.\n* The <code>Binding</code> attributes of the <code><md:SingleSignOnService></code> elements are standard URIs specified in the SAML&nbsp;2.0 Binding specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>).\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:SingleSignOnService></code> element that supports the HTTP POST binding is used in step&nbsp;2 of the \"[[#SP POST Request; IdP POST Response|double POST]]\" profile.\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:SingleSignOnService></code> element that supports the HTTP Artifact binding is used in step&nbsp;2 of the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile.\n* The <code><saml:Attribute></code> element describes an attribute that the identity provider is willing to assert (subject to policy).  The <code><saml:AttributeValue></code> elements enumerate the possible values the attribute may take on.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this section, the values of the <code>Location</code> attributes are used by a service provider to route SAML messages, which minimizes the possibility of a rogue identity provider orchestrating a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].\n\n===Service provider metadata===\n\nLike the identity provider, a service provider publishes data about itself in an <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2\" validUntil=\"2013-03-22T23:00:00Z\"\n    xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n    <!-- insert ds:Signature element (omitted) -->\n    <!-- insert md:SPSSODescriptor element (see below) -->\n    <md:Organization>\n      <md:OrganizationName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Commercial Vendor of California</md:OrganizationName>\n      <md:OrganizationDisplayName xml:lang=\"en\">Some Commercial Vendor</md:OrganizationDisplayName>\n      <md:OrganizationURL xml:lang=\"en\">https://www.example.com/</md:OrganizationURL>\n    </md:Organization>\n    <md:ContactPerson contactType=\"technical\">\n      <md:SurName>SAML Technical Support</md:SurName>\n      <md:EmailAddress>mailto:saml-support@example.com</md:EmailAddress>\n    </md:ContactPerson>\n  </md:EntityDescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about this entity descriptor:\n\n* The <code>entityID</code> attribute is the unique identifier of the entity.\n* The <code>validUntil</code> attribute gives the expiration date of the metadata.\n* The <code><ds:Signature></code> element (which has been omitted for simplicity) contains a digital signature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of the metadata.\n* The organization identified in the <code><md:Organization></code> element is \"responsible for the entity\" described by the entity descriptor (section&nbsp;2.3.2 of SAMLMeta<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>).\n* The contact information in the <code><md:ContactPerson></code> element identifies a technical contact responsible for the entity. Multiple contacts and contact types are possible. See section&nbsp;2.3.2.2 of SAMLMeta.<ref name=\"SAMLMeta\"/>\n\nBy definition, a service provider manages an assertion consumer service that supports the SAML Web Browser SSO profile specified in SAMLProf.<ref name=\"SAMLProf\"/> See, for example, the service provider described in the <code><md:SPSSODescriptor></code> element shown in the next section.\n\n====Assertion consumer service metadata====\n\nThe assertion consumer service is contained in an <code><md:SPSSODescriptor></code> element:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:SPSSODescriptor\n    protocolSupportEnumeration=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\">\n    <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\">\n      <ds:KeyInfo>...</ds:KeyInfo>\n    </md:KeyDescriptor>\n    <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"encryption\">\n      <ds:KeyInfo>...</ds:KeyInfo>\n    </md:KeyDescriptor>\n    <md:ArtifactResolutionService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"0\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP\"\n      Location=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/ArtifactResolution\"/>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient</md:NameIDFormat>\n    <md:AssertionConsumerService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"0\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\"\n      Location=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST\"/>\n    <md:AssertionConsumerService index=\"1\"\n      Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Artifact\"\n      Location=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2/Artifact\"/>\n    <md:AttributeConsumingService isDefault=\"true\" index=\"1\">\n      <md:ServiceName xml:lang=\"en\">Service Provider Portal</md:ServiceName>\n      <md:RequestedAttribute\n        NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri\"\n        Name=\"urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1\"\n        FriendlyName=\"eduPersonAffiliation\">\n      </md:RequestedAttribute>\n    </md:AttributeConsumingService>\n  </md:SPSSODescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about the <code><md:SPSSODescriptor></code> metadata element:\n\n* The service provider software is configured with a private SAML signing key and/or a private back-channel TLS key. The corresponding public key is included in the <code><md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\"></code> element in SP metadata. The key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity.\n* Likewise the service provider software is configured with a private SAML decryption key. A public SAML encryption key is included in the <code><md:KeyDescriptor use=\"encryption\"></code> element in SP metadata. The key material has been omitted from the key descriptor for brevity.\n* The <code>index</code> attribute of an <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> element is used as the value of the <code>AssertionConsumerServiceIndex</code> attribute in a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element.\n* The <code>Binding</code> attributes of the <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> elements are standard URIs specified in the SAML&nbsp;2.0 Binding specification (SAMLBind<ref name=\"SAMLBind\"/>).\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> element that supports the HTTP POST binding (<code>index=\"0\"</code>) is used in step&nbsp;4 of the \"[[#SP POST Request; IdP POST Response|double POST]]\" profile.\n* The <code>Location</code> attribute of the <code><md:AssertionConsumerService></code> element that supports the HTTP Artifact binding (<code>index=\"1\"</code>) is used in step&nbsp;6 of the \"[[#SP Redirect Artifact; IdP Redirect Artifact|double artifact]]\" profile.\n* The <code><md:AttributeConsumingService></code> element is used by the identity provider to formulate an <code><saml:AttributeStatement></code> element that is pushed to the service provider in conjunction with Web Browser SSO.\n* The <code>index</code> attribute of the <code><md:AttributeConsumingService></code> element is used as the value of the <code>AttributeConsumingServiceIndex</code> attribute in a <code><samlp:AuthnRequest></code> element.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this section, the values of the <code>Location</code> attributes are used by an identity provider to route SAML messages, which minimizes the possibility of a rogue service provider orchestrating a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].\n\n===Metadata aggregates===\n\nIn the previous examples, each <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> element is shown to be digitally signed. In practice, however, multiple <code><md:EntityDescriptor></code> elements are grouped together under an <code><md:EntitiesDescriptor></code> element with a single digital signature over the entire aggregate:\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <md:EntitiesDescriptor validUntil=\"2013-03-22T23:00:00Z\"\n    xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\n    xmlns:saml=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"\n    xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n    <!-- insert ds:Signature element (omitted) -->\n    <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://idp.example.org/SAML2\">\n      ...\n    </md:EntityDescriptor>\n    <md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"https://sp.example.com/SAML2\">\n      ...\n    </md:EntityDescriptor>\n  </md:EntitiesDescriptor>\n</source>\n\nNote the following details about the above <code><md:EntitiesDescriptor></code> element:\n\n* The digital signature (which has been omitted for brevity) covers the entire aggregate.\n* The <code>validUntil</code> XML attribute has been elevated to the parent element, implying that the expiration date applies to each child element.\n* The XML namespace declarations have been elevated to the parent element to avoid redundant namespace declarations.\n\nTypically metadata aggregates are published by trusted third parties called ''federations'' who vouch for the integrity of all the metadata in the aggregate. Note that metadata aggregates can be very large, composed of hundreds or even thousands of entities per aggregate.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Security Assertion Markup Language]]\n* [[SAML 1.1]]\n* [[SAML metadata]]\n* [[SAML-based products and services]]\n* [[OpenID Connect]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Primary references:'''\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"SAMLCore\">S.&nbsp;Cantor et al.
