By the age of 10, he had passed the audition for the Mitchell Boys Choir (founded by [[Bob Mitchell]]) in Hollywood, California where he studied music theory from 1974 to 1981. In 1977, whilst still attending the Mitchell Boys, he performed vocals on composer [[Ennio Morricone]]\u2019s [[Exorcist II: The Heretic]] soundtrack as well as contributing to the made for TV American movie [[The Possessed (1977 film)]] directed by [[Jerry Thorpe]].

A year later Darling Cruel signed to George Michael\u2019s management company, Lippmann/Kahane.<ref name=\"LAtimes\"/>\n\nIn September 1989, Darling Cruel released their debut album \"Passion Crimes\". The album garnered great reviews and Darling\u2019s extraordinary vocal range was officially acknowledged for the first time \u2013 \u201ca man with a range and vision that is as unique in approach as W. Axl Rose of Guns n\u2019 Roses ..twisting with the confidence of Terence Trent Darby before contortioning into a mutoid David Coverdale\u201d.<ref name=\"MetalHammer\"/> \"Everything\u2019s Over\", the first single lifted from the album, secured active rotation on MTV for six months whilst the album entered the Billboard Top 200 album chart. \"Love Child\" became the second single to be released from the album.\n \nIn 1990 Polygram president Dick Asher resigned whilst Darling Cruel recorded new album \"Movies For The Mind\" in New York with producer [[Tony Visconti]].

A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]]. Between 1998 and 2000 Darling embarked on a world tour with Lennon playing piano and providing backing vocals.\n \nIn 2001, Darling worked alongside producer [[Richard Perry]] as arranger and musician for his Baby Genius project before continuing his co-writing work with Julian Lennon at the latter\u2019s Treehouse Studios.

The same year saw him collaborate with electro/acoustic/pop/folk/reggae outfit Caligagan on their album \"Naked Garden\" and co-writing three songs \u2013 \"Hold On\", \"Don\u2019t Wake Me Up\" and \"Beautiful\" \u2013 on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s Everything Changes album.\n\nIn 2012 Darling released his third solo album \"Coloured Life\" on FOD Records, an album that again saw him compared to both Elton John and Billy Joel.<ref name=\"SundayTimes2\"/> He subsequently performed piano on [[East 17]]\u2019s fifth album [[Dark_Light_(East_17_album)|Dark Light]] (2012) then performed co-writing duties, played piano and provided background vocals on [[Tony Mortimer]]\u2019s debut solo album \"Songs From The Suitcase\" released in 2013.

Axl Rose of Guns n\u2019 Roses ..twisting with the confidence of Terence Trent Darby before contortioning into a mutoid David Coverdale\u201d.<ref name=\"MetalHammer\"/> \"Everything\u2019s Over\", the first single lifted from the album, secured active rotation on MTV for six months whilst the album entered the Billboard Top 200 album chart. \"Love Child\" became the second single to be released from the album.\n \nIn 1990 Polygram president Dick Asher resigned whilst Darling Cruel recorded new album \"Movies For The Mind\" in New York with producer [[Tony Visconti]].

A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]].

The same year saw him collaborate with electro/acoustic/pop/folk/reggae outfit Caligagan on their album \"Naked Garden\" and co-writing three songs \u2013 \"Hold On\", \"Don\u2019t Wake Me Up\" and \"Beautiful\" \u2013 on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s Everything Changes album.\n\nIn 2012 Darling released his third solo album \"Coloured Life\" on FOD Records, an album that again saw him compared to both Elton John and Billy Joel.<ref name=\"SundayTimes2\"/> He subsequently performed piano on [[East 17]]\u2019s fifth album [[Dark_Light_(East_17_album)|Dark Light]] (2012) then performed co-writing duties, played piano and provided background vocals on [[Tony Mortimer]]\u2019s debut solo album \"Songs From The Suitcase\" released in 2013.

[[n-Butyllithium]] undergoes a [[Organolithium reagent|halogen-lithium exchange]] reaction with the bromide at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to yield the intermediate '''c'''. The intermediate '''b''' is then added to a solution containing intermediate '''c''' dropwise. After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 [[anomer]]s was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]].
