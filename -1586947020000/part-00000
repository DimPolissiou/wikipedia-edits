Since switches can have redundant power circuits connected to [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], the connected device can continue operating even when regular office power fails.\n\n== Layer-specific functionality ==\n[[File:Smartswitch6000.jpg|thumb|A modular network switch with three network modules (a total of 24 Ethernet and 14 Fast Ethernet ports) and one power supply.]]\n\nModern commercial switches use primarily Ethernet interfaces. The core function of an Ethernet switch is to provide multiport layer-2 bridging. Many switches also perform operations at other layers. A device capable of more than bridging is known as a multilayer switch.<!-- Let's work towards merging the details below into [[Multilayer switch]] --> Switches may learn about topologies at many layers and forward at one or more layers.\n\n=== Layer 1 ===\nA layer 1 network device transfers data but does not manage any of the traffic coming through it, an example is [[Ethernet hub]].  Any packet entering a [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is repeated to the output of every other port except for the port of entry. Specifically, each bit or symbol is repeated as it flows in. A repeater hub can therefore only receive and forward at a single speed.<ref>Dual speed hubs internally consist of two hubs with a bridge between them.</ref> Since every packet is repeated on every other port, packet [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collisions]] affect the entire network, limiting its overall capacity.\n\nBy the early 2000s, there was little price difference between a hub and a low-end switch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Switches and Hubs |author=Matthew Glidden |work= About This Particular Macintosh blog |date= October 2001 |accessdate= June 9, 2011 |url=http://www.atpm.com/7.10/networking-1.shtml }}</ref> Hubs remained useful for a time for specialized applications, such supplying a copy of network traffic to a [[packet analyzer]]. A [[network tap]] may also be used for this purpose and many network switches now have a [[port mirroring]] feature that provides the same functionality.\n\n=== Layer 2 ===\n[[File:5 Port Gigabit Netzwerk-Switch TL-SG1005D 01.jpg|alt=A 5-port layer-2 switch without management functionality|thumb|A 5-port layer-2 switch without management functionality]]\n\n{{main|Bridging (networking)}}\n\nA layer 2 network device is a multiport device that uses hardware addresses, [[MAC address]], to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2).\n\nA switch operating as a network bridge may interconnect devices in a home or office. The bridge learns the [[MAC address]] of each connected device. Bridges also buffer an incoming packet and adapt the transmission speed to that of the outgoing port. While there are specialized applications, such as storage area networks, where the input and output interfaces are the same bandwidth, this is not always the case in general LAN applications. In LANs, a switch used for end-user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth and [[uplink]]s into a higher bandwidth.\n\nInterconnect between switches may be regulated using [[spanning tree protocol]] (STP) that disables links so that the resulting local area network is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] without loops. In contrast to routers, spanning tree bridges must have topologies with only one active path between two points. [[Shortest path bridging]] is a layer 2 alternative to STP that allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Shortest Path Bridging IEEE 802.1aq Overview\n |publisher    = Huawei\n |author       = Peter Ashwood-Smith\n |date         = 24 Feb 2011\n |url          = http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |accessdate   = 11 May 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515115628/http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |archive-date = 15 May 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |title = IEEE Approves New IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Standard\n |publisher = Tech Power Up\n |date = 7 May 2012\n |url = http://www.techpowerup.com/165594/IEEE-Approves-New-IEEE-802.1aq-Shortest-Path-Bridging-Standard.html\n |accessdate = 11 May 2012\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 3 ===\nA layer-3 switch can perform some or all of the functions normally performed by a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Most network switches, however, are limited to supporting a single type of physical network, typically Ethernet, whereas a router may support different kinds of physical networks on different ports.\n\nA common layer-3 capability is an awareness of [[IP multicast]] through [[IGMP snooping]]. With this awareness, a layer-3 switch can increase efficiency by delivering the traffic of a multicast group only to ports where the attached device has signaled that it wants to listen to that group.\n\nLayer-3 switches typically support [[IP routing]] between VLANs configured on the switch. Some layer-3 switches support the [[routing protocol]]s that routers use to exchange information about routes between networks.\n\n=== Layer 4 ===\nA layer-4 switch can use information in the transport-layer protocols to make forwarding decisions. Principally this refers to an ability to use source and destination port numbers in TCP and UDP communications to allow, block and prioritize communications.<ref>{{cite book |title=CCNP : building CISCO multilayer switched networks : study guide |last=Jack |first=Terry |isbn=9780585496849 |date=2004 |publisher=Sybex |page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 7 ===\nLayer-7 switches may distribute the load based on [[uniform resource locator]]s (URLs), or by using some installation-specific technique to recognize application-level transactions.

They are [[plug and play]]. They are typically the least expensive switches, and therefore often used in a [[SOHO network|small office/home office]] environment. Unmanaged switches can be desktop or rack mounted.\n*'''Managed switches''' have one or more methods to modify the operation of the switch. Common management methods include: a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) accessed via [[serial console]], [[telnet]] or [[Secure Shell]], an embedded [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP) agent allowing management from a remote console or management station, or a web interface for management from a [[web browser]]. Examples of configuration changes that one can do from a managed switch include: enabling features such as [[Spanning Tree Protocol]] or port mirroring, setting [[Bit rate|port bandwidth]], creating or modifying [[virtual LAN]]s (VLANs), etc. Two sub-classes of managed switches are smart and enterprise managed switches. \n*'''Smart switches''' (aka intelligent switches) are managed switches with a limited set of management features. Likewise, \"web-managed\" switches are switches that fall into a market niche between unmanaged and managed. For a price much lower than a fully managed switch they provide a web interface (and usually no CLI access) and allow configuration of basic settings, such as VLANs, port-bandwidth and duplex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |title=Tech specs for a  sample HP \"web-managed\" switch |accessdate=2007-05-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213185114/http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> \n*'''Enterprise managed switches''' (aka managed switches) have a full set of management features, including CLI, SNMP agent, and web interface.

Since switches can have redundant power circuits connected to [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], the connected device can continue operating even when regular office power fails.\n\n== Layer-specific functionality ==\n[[File:Smartswitch6000.jpg|thumb|A modular network switch with three network modules (a total of 24 Ethernet and 14 Fast Ethernet ports) and one power supply.]]\n\nModern commercial switches use primarily Ethernet interfaces. The core function of an Ethernet switch is to provide multiport layer-2 bridging. Many switches also perform operations at other layers. A device capable of more than bridging is known as a multilayer switch.<!-- Let's work towards merging the details below into [[Multilayer switch]] --> Switches may learn about topologies at many layers and forward at one or more layers.\n\n=== Layer 1 ===\nA layer 1 network device transfers data but does not manage any of the traffic coming through it, an example is [[Ethernet hub]].  Any packet entering a [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is repeated to the output of every other port except for the port of entry. Specifically, each bit or symbol is repeated as it flows in. A repeater hub can therefore only receive and forward at a single speed.<ref>Dual speed hubs internally consist of two hubs with a bridge between them.</ref> Since every packet is repeated on every other port, packet [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collisions]] affect the entire network, limiting its overall capacity.\n\nBy the early 2000s, there was little price difference between a hub and a low-end switch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Switches and Hubs |author=Matthew Glidden |work= About This Particular Macintosh blog |date= October 2001 |accessdate= June 9, 2011 |url=http://www.atpm.com/7.10/networking-1.shtml }}</ref> Hubs remained useful for a time for specialized applications, such supplying a copy of network traffic to a [[packet analyzer]]. A [[network tap]] may also be used for this purpose and many network switches now have a [[port mirroring]] feature that provides the same functionality.\n\n=== Layer 2 ===\n[[File:5 Port Gigabit Netzwerk-Switch TL-SG1005D 01.jpg|alt=A 5-port layer-2 switch without management functionality|thumb|A 5-port layer-2 switch without management functionality]]\n\n{{main|Bridging (networking)}}\n\nA layer 2 network device is a multiport device that uses hardware addresses, [[MAC address]], to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2).\n\nA switch operating as a network bridge may interconnect devices in a home or office. The bridge learns the [[MAC address]] of each connected device. Bridges also buffer an incoming packet and adapt the transmission speed to that of the outgoing port. While there are specialized applications, such as storage area networks, where the input and output interfaces are the same bandwidth, this is not always the case in general LAN applications. In LANs, a switch used for end-user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth and [[uplink]]s into a higher bandwidth.\n\nInterconnect between switches may be regulated using [[spanning tree protocol]] (STP) that disables links so that the resulting local area network is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] without loops. In contrast to routers, spanning tree bridges must have topologies with only one active path between two points. [[Shortest path bridging]] is a layer 2 alternative to STP that allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Shortest Path Bridging IEEE 802.1aq Overview\n |publisher    = Huawei\n |author       = Peter Ashwood-Smith\n |date         = 24 Feb 2011\n |url          = http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |accessdate   = 11 May 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515115628/http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |archive-date = 15 May 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |title = IEEE Approves New IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Standard\n |publisher = Tech Power Up\n |date = 7 May 2012\n |url = http://www.techpowerup.com/165594/IEEE-Approves-New-IEEE-802.1aq-Shortest-Path-Bridging-Standard.html\n |accessdate = 11 May 2012\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 3 ===\nA layer-3 switch can perform some or all of the functions normally performed by a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Most network switches, however, are limited to supporting a single type of physical network, typically Ethernet, whereas a router may support different kinds of physical networks on different ports.\n\nA common layer-3 capability is an awareness of [[IP multicast]] through [[IGMP snooping]]. With this awareness, a layer-3 switch can increase efficiency by delivering the traffic of a multicast group only to ports where the attached device has signaled that it wants to listen to that group.\n\nLayer-3 switches typically support [[IP routing]] between VLANs configured on the switch. Some layer-3 switches support the [[routing protocol]]s that routers use to exchange information about routes between networks.\n\n=== Layer 4 ===\nA layer-4 switch can use information in the transport-layer protocols to make forwarding decisions. Principally this refers to an ability to use source and destination port numbers in TCP and UDP communications to allow, block and prioritize communications.<ref>{{cite book |title=CCNP : building CISCO multilayer switched networks : study guide |last=Jack |first=Terry |isbn=9780585496849 |date=2004 |publisher=Sybex |page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 7 ===\nLayer-7 switches may distribute the load based on [[uniform resource locator]]s (URLs), or by using some installation-specific technique to recognize application-level transactions.

They are [[plug and play]]. They are typically the least expensive switches, and therefore often used in a [[SOHO network|small office/home office]] environment. Unmanaged switches can be desktop or rack mounted.\n*'''Managed switches''' have one or more methods to modify the operation of the switch. Common management methods include: a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) accessed via [[serial console]], [[telnet]] or [[Secure Shell]], an embedded [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP) agent allowing management from a remote console or management station, or a web interface for management from a [[web browser]]. Examples of configuration changes that one can do from a managed switch include: enabling features such as [[Spanning Tree Protocol]] or port mirroring, setting [[Bit rate|port bandwidth]], creating or modifying [[virtual LAN]]s (VLANs), etc. Two sub-classes of managed switches are smart and enterprise managed switches. \n*'''Smart switches''' (aka intelligent switches) are managed switches with a limited set of management features. Likewise, \"web-managed\" switches are switches that fall into a market niche between unmanaged and managed. For a price much lower than a fully managed switch they provide a web interface (and usually no CLI access) and allow configuration of basic settings, such as VLANs, port-bandwidth and duplex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |title=Tech specs for a  sample HP \"web-managed\" switch |accessdate=2007-05-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213185114/http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> \n*'''Enterprise managed switches''' (aka managed switches) have a full set of management features, including CLI, SNMP agent, and web interface.

This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams.

The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the \u00a3737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref> The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:\n\n====Phase A====\nTo support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory.

Northern terminus!! Route\n|-\n|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory\n|}\n\nIt has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost \u00a3425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at \u00a3275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.

This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\nThe tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams.

The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the \u00a3737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref> The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:\n\n====Phase A====\nTo support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThe plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.\n\n===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===\nThe only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf</ref> A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.<ref>https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7</ref>\n\nIn the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.<ref>https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a proposed \u00a3320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.<ref>https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf</ref> The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory.

Northern terminus!! Route\n|-\n|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory\n|-\n|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory\n|}\n\nIt has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost \u00a3425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at \u00a3275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at \u00a3300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.<ref>https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/</ref> Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.\n\nIn February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north\u2013south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for \u00a3425m on the condition of securing additional funding.<ref name=\"consultations.tfl.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===Projected extensions===\nThe Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point.
