Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.\n\n\"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\" [[Susan B. Anthony]] said \"I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.\"\n\nThe modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.<ref>\"Equality for Women in the Olympics.\" Feminist Majority Foundation. Web.

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.\n<gallery caption=\"Women's sports in history\">\nFile:Bronze figure of a running girl, Greek, about 520-500 BC, Found at Prizren, Serbia, Winning at the ancient Games, British Museum (7667206370).jpg|A [[Spartan]] woman running.

The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=238}}</ref> This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.<ref name=\"Greenburg_1997\" /> In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the \"three-part test\".\n\n# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are \"substantially proportionate\" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.\n# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).\n# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.\n\n====== Room for improvement ======\nAlthough schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, a 1999 study by Sigelman and Wahlbeck found that many schools are \"nowhere near compliance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigelman|first=Lee|last2=Wahlbeck|first2=Paul|date=1999|title=Gender Proportionality in Intercollegiate Athletics: The Mathematics of Title IX Compliance|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=80|issue=3|pages=518\u2013538|jstor=42863927}}</ref> Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irons|first=Alicia|date=Spring 2006|title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX|url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf|journal=Major Themes in Economics|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information|title=Title IX Information|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011, 4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title IX laws.<ref name=\"auto\">Wong, A.

There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new women\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.<ref>M.

Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women's teams; in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent.<ref name=\"coakley255\">{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=255}}</ref> In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women's athletic programs, and in 2004 this fell to 19 percent.

This pay discrepancy exists despite the fact that the women's team has been much more successful in international competitions; the women's team has won four Olympic gold medals and three of the last five Women's World Cups, while the men's team has never won either of these competitions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html?_r=0|title=Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination|author=Andrew Das|date=2016-03-31|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2016-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===World conferences===\n\nIn 1994, the International Working Group on Women and Sport organized the first World Conference on Women and Sport in Brighton, United Kingdom, where the Brighton Declaration was published.

Substantial research indicates that women's sports and female athletes gain only a small fraction of sports media coverage worldwide. Research that has examined why this is the case suggested this can be attributed to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the male-dominated sports newsroom, ingrained assumptions about readership, and the systematic, repetitive nature of sports news.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sherwood|first=Merryn|last2=Osborne|first2=Angela|last3=Nicholson|first3=Matthew|last4=Sherry|first4=Emma|date=December 2017|title=Newswork, News Values, and Audience Considerations: Factors That Facilitate Media Coverage of Women's Sports|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=647\u2013668|doi=10.1177/2167479516645535|issn=2167-4795}}</ref> In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.<ref>{{cite web |title=When it comes to women in sports, TV news tunes out |url=https://news.usc.edu/82382/when-it-comes-to-women-in-sports-tv-news-tunes-out/}}</ref> Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories.

In the late 1900s Women's Sports started to gain popularity in the media because of their talent in the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An Imperceptible Difference: Visual and Textual Constructions of Femininity in Sport Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Women |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=b1aa5c2a-a43c-40c6-97e5-7d193c12cfdd%40sdc-v-sessmgr01}}</ref> In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.\n\nWhen researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.<ref>\"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports.\" LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/</ref> The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.<ref>Holmes, Tracy. \"After Homophobia Let's Tackle Prejudice Against Women's Sports.\" ABC.

In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage.

Despite this jump in viewership of women's soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women's professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men's league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women's Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women's sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men's sports (or approximately 11\u00bd hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women's sports. SportsCenter's numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men's sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women's sports (approximately 17 min).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|last2=Messner|first2=Michael A.|last3=Musto|first3=Michela|date=September 2015|title=\"It's Dude Time!\": A Quarter Century of Excluding Women's Sports in Televised News and Highlight Shows|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=261\u2013287|doi=10.1177/2167479515588761|issn=2167-4795}}</ref>\n\nA recent article from the Wall Street Journal states \u201cfrom 2016 to 2018, women's games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer's audited financial statements<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Rachel |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Games Outearned Men's Games |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600. |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\u201d (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women's sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women's soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women's soccer displayed most recently within the Women's FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The U.S. Women's National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women's sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue. \n\nAmy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. \"Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.\" She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. \"The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements.\"<ref>\"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting\" ''Science Daily''.

Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\">Cooky, C., & Lavoi, N.

Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.\n\n\"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\" [[Susan B. Anthony]] said \"I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.\"\n\nThe modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.<ref>\"Equality for Women in the Olympics.\" Feminist Majority Foundation. Web.

Thus [[netball]] was developed out of [[basketball]] and [[softball]] out of [[baseball]].\n\nIn response to the lack of support for women's international sport the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale]] was founded in France by [[Alice Milliat]].

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.\n<gallery caption=\"Women's sports in history\">\nFile:Bronze figure of a running girl, Greek, about 520-500 BC, Found at Prizren, Serbia, Winning at the ancient Games, British Museum (7667206370).jpg|A [[Spartan]] woman running.

The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=238}}</ref> This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.<ref name=\"Greenburg_1997\" /> In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the \"three-part test\".\n\n# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are \"substantially proportionate\" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.\n# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).\n# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.\n\n====== Room for improvement ======\nAlthough schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, a 1999 study by Sigelman and Wahlbeck found that many schools are \"nowhere near compliance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigelman|first=Lee|last2=Wahlbeck|first2=Paul|date=1999|title=Gender Proportionality in Intercollegiate Athletics: The Mathematics of Title IX Compliance|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=80|issue=3|pages=518\u2013538|jstor=42863927}}</ref> Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irons|first=Alicia|date=Spring 2006|title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX|url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf|journal=Major Themes in Economics|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information|title=Title IX Information|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011, 4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title IX laws.<ref name=\"auto\">Wong, A.

There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new women\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.<ref>M.

The same study revealed that Women's handball is covered and followed as equally if not more than the men's team. In contrast to international handball coverage, the Norwegian coverage of Men's and Women's handball are discussed in the media using the same or similar verbiage. While they are especially noticeable in handball, equality and opportunity in Norwegian sports is not limited to the handball. Many top-female athletes from a number of sports have come from Norway.

Sweden is recognized as being a feminist country, however the wage gap is significant between male and female athletes. In 2013, Swedish striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned  $16.7 million a year playing for Paris Saint-German, whereas Lotta Schellin who played for Lyon in France only earned $239,720. The wage gap is also evident among coaches. The difference in pay is evident in how male athletes and female athletes are able to spend their time between games.

In the late 1900s Women's Sports started to gain popularity in the media because of their talent in the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An Imperceptible Difference: Visual and Textual Constructions of Femininity in Sport Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Women |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=b1aa5c2a-a43c-40c6-97e5-7d193c12cfdd%40sdc-v-sessmgr01}}</ref> In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.\n\nWhen researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.<ref>\"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports.\" LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/</ref> The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.<ref>Holmes, Tracy. \"After Homophobia Let's Tackle Prejudice Against Women's Sports.\" ABC.

In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage.

Despite this jump in viewership of women's soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women's professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men's league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women's Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women's sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men's sports (or approximately 11\u00bd hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women's sports. SportsCenter's numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men's sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women's sports (approximately 17 min).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|last2=Messner|first2=Michael A.|last3=Musto|first3=Michela|date=September 2015|title=\"It's Dude Time!\": A Quarter Century of Excluding Women's Sports in Televised News and Highlight Shows|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=261\u2013287|doi=10.1177/2167479515588761|issn=2167-4795}}</ref>\n\nA recent article from the Wall Street Journal states \u201cfrom 2016 to 2018, women's games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer's audited financial statements<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Rachel |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Games Outearned Men's Games |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600. |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\u201d (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women's sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women's soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women's soccer displayed most recently within the Women's FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The U.S. Women's National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women's sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue. \n\nAmy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. \"Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.\" She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. \"The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements.\"<ref>\"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting\" ''Science Daily''.

Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\">Cooky, C., & Lavoi, N.

This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture.

It is the period in Japanese history when [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and other [[Chinese influence on Japanese culture|Chinese influences]] were at their height. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese [[Emperors of Japan|imperial court]] and noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], especially [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]]. Although the [[Imperial House of Japan]] had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the [[Fujiwara clan]], a powerful [[Kuge|aristocratic family]] who had intermarried with the [[Emperor of Japan|imperial family]]. Many emperors actually had mothers from the Fujiwara family.<ref name=Seal>Seal.</ref> {{nihongo|''Heian''|\u5e73\u5b89}} means \"peace\" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].\n\n==History==\nThe Heian period was preceded by the [[Nara period]] and began in 794 CE after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian-ky\u014d (present-day Ky\u014dto), by the 50th emperor, Emperor Kanmu <ref>Shively and McCullough 1999.</ref> Kanmu first tried to move the capital to [[Nagaoka-ky\u014d]], but a series of disasters befell the city, prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time, to Heian. A rebellion occurred in China in the last years of the 9th century, making the political situation unstable. The [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] were suspended and the influx of Chinese exports halted, a fact which facilitated the independent growth of Japanese culture called {{illm|Kokufu bunka|ja|\u56fd\u98a8\u6587\u5316|lt=''kokufu bunka''}}. Therefore, the Heian Period is considered a high point in Japanese culture that later generations have always admired. The period is also noted for the rise of the [[samurai]] class, which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of Japan.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNominally, sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact, power was wielded by the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] nobility. However, to protect their interests in the provinces, the Fujiwara, and other noble families required guards, police and soldiers. The warrior class made steady political gains throughout the Heian period.<ref name=Seal/> As early as 939 CE, [[Taira no Masakado]] threatened the authority of the central government, leading an uprising in the eastern province of [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]], and almost simultaneously, [[Fujiwara no Sumitomo]] rebelled in the west. Still, a true military takeover of the Japanese government was centuries away, when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe entry of the warrior class into court influence was a result of the [[H\u014dgen Rebellion]]. At this time [[Taira no Kiyomori]] revived the Fujiwara practices by placing his grandson on the throne to rule Japan by regency. Their clan, the [[Taira clan|Taira]], would not be overthrown until after the [[Genpei War]], which marked the start of the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. The [[Kamakura period]] began in 1185 when [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in Kamakura.<ref>''Ancient Japan''.</ref>\n\nHailey is so cool\n\n===Rise of the military class===\nUnder the early courts, when military [[conscription]] had been centrally controlled, military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy. But as the system broke down after 792, local power holders again became the primary source of military strength. The re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error. At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi, which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi, which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks. This gave rise to the Japanese military class. Nonetheless, final authority rested with the imperial court.<ref>Friday 1988 pp. 155\u2013170.</ref>\n\n''Sh\u014den'' holders had access to manpower and, as they obtained improved military technology (such as new training methods, more powerful bows, armor, horses, and superior swords) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century, military service became part of ''sh\u014den'' life. Not only the ''sh\u014den'' but also civil and religious institutions formed private guard units to protect themselves. Gradually, the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite of [[samurai]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBushi interests were diverse, cutting across old power structures to form new associations in the tenth century. Mutual interests, family connections, and kinship were consolidated in military groups that became part of family administration. In time, large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures. These military families gained prestige from connections to the imperial court and court-granted military titles and access to manpower. The Fujiwara family, Taira clan, and Minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nA decline in food production, the growth of the population, and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of Fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries. Members of the Fujiwara, Taira, and [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] families\u2014all of whom had descended from the imperial family\u2014attacked one another, claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land, set up rival regimes, and generally upset the peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d]] (1068\u20131073), the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century. Go-Sanjo, determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule, implemented reforms to curb Fujiwara influence. He also established an office to compile and validate [[Estate (house)|estate]] records with the aim of reasserting central control. Many ''sh\u014den'' were not properly certified, and large landholders, like the Fujiwara, felt threatened with the loss of their lands. Go-Sanjo also established the {{illm|In-no-ch\u014d|ja|\u9662\u5e81|lt=''In-no-ch\u014d''}} ({{lang|ja|\u9662\u5e81}} \"Office of the Cloistered Emperor\"), which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind-the-scenes governance, or ''[[Cloistered rule|insei]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe ''In-no-ch\u014d'' filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising [[Minamoto clan]]. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the ''insei'' system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne. The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the ''In-no-ch\u014d'' and of the rise of the military class throughout the country. Military might rather than civil authority dominated the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[File:DanNoUra.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] on 25 April 1185, [[Genpei War]]]]\n[[File:Map-of-Japan-1183-Heian-Genpei-War.png|thumb|Map of Japan in 1183 during the [[Genpei War]]]]\nA struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power. [[Fujiwara no Yorinaga]] sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1156 against the heir apparent, who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto ([[H\u014dgen Rebellion]]). In the end, the Fujiwara were destroyed, the old system of government supplanted, and the ''insei'' system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs, marking a turning point in Japanese history. In 1159, the Taira and Minamoto clashed ([[Heiji Rebellion]]), and a twenty-year period of Taira ascendancy began.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[Taira no Kiyomori]] emerged as the real power in Japan following the Fujiwara's destruction, and he would remain in command for the next 20 years. He gave his daughter [[Taira no Tokuko|Tokuko]] in marriage to the young [[emperor Takakura]], who died at only 19, leaving their infant son [[Antoku]] to succeed to the throne. Kiyomori filled no less than 50 government posts with his relatives, rebuilt the Inland Sea, and encouraged trade with Song China. He also took aggressive actions to safeguard his power when necessary, including the removal and exile of 45 court officials and the razing of two troublesome temples, Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe Taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}, where the Minamoto clan were rebuilding their strength. In 1183, two years after Kiyomori's death, Yoritomo Minamoto dispatched his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to attack Kyoto. The Taira were routed and forced to flee, and the Empress Dowager tried to drown herself and the 7-year old Emperor (he perished, but his mother survived). Takakura's other son succeeded as Emperor [[Go-Toba]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nWith Yoritomo firmly established, the ''bakufu'' system that governed Japan for the next seven centuries was in place. He appointed military governors, or ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', to rule over the provinces, and stewards, or ''jito'' to supervise public and private estates. Yoritomo then turned his attention to the elimination of the powerful Fujiwara family, which sheltered his rebellious brother Yoshitsune. Three years later, he was appointed ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in Kyoto. One year before his death in 1199, Yoritomo expelled the teenaged emperor Go-Toba from the throne. Two of Go-Toba's sons succeeded him, but they would also be removed by Yoritomo's successors to the shogunate.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Heian culture==\n\n===Developments in Buddhism===\n[[File:Danjogaran Koyasan12n3200.jpg|thumb|Danjogaran of [[Mount K\u014dya]]. The place is a center of the sacred ground of Shingon.]]\n[[File:Fugen enmei painting.jpg|thumb|''[[Samantabhadra|Bodhisattva Fugen Enmei]]'', 12th-century painting on silk, late Heian period]]\n[[File:Standing Komoku Ten (Virupakusa) Heian Period, 12th century.tiff|thumb|''Standing Komoku Ten'' (Virupakusa)]]\n[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saich\u014d]] was key to its transmission to Japan. Shingon is the Japanese transmission of the Chinese Chen Yen school.  Shingon, brought to Japan by the monk [[K\u016bkai]], emphasizes [[Vajrayana]].  Both K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy,<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 59.</ref> leading to the notion of \"aristocratic Buddhism\".<ref>Weinstein 1999.</ref>  An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to \"every creature\".<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 60.</ref> Saich\u014d also sought independent ordination for Tendai monks.<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 61.</ref>  A close relationship developed between the Tendai monastery complex on [[Mount Hiei]] and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain. As a result, Tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation. Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. K\u016bkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded Kanmu, and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture.  Shingon, through its use of \"rich symbols, rituals and [[mandala]]s\"<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 65.</ref> held a wide-ranging appeal.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Literature===\nAlthough written [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Kanbun]]) remained the official language of the Heian period imperial court, the introduction and widespread use of [[kana]] saw a boom in [[Japanese literature]]. Despite the establishment of several new literary genres such as the [[novel]] and narrative ''[[monogatari]]'' (\u7269\u8a9e) and essays, [[literacy]] was only common among the court and [[Buddhist]] clergy.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nPoetry, in particular, was a staple of court life. Nobles and ladies-in-waiting were expected to be well versed in the art of writing poetry as a mark of their status. Every occasion could call for the writing of a verse, from the birth of a child to the coronation of an emperor, or even a pretty scene of nature. A well-written poem could easily make or break one's reputation, and often was a key part of social interaction.<ref>Morris 1964 pp. 180, 182.</ref> Almost as important was the choice of calligraphy, or handwriting, used. The Japanese of this period believed handwriting could reflect the condition of a person's soul: therefore, poor or hasty writing could be considered a sign of poor breeding. Whether the script was Chinese or Japanese, good writing and artistic skill were paramount to social reputation when it came to poetry. [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]] mentions in her ''[[Pillow Book]]'' that when a certain courtier tried to ask her advice about how to write a poem to the Empress Sadako, she had to politely rebuke him because his writing was so poor.<ref>Morris 1964 pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\nThe lyrics of the modern Japanese national anthem, ''[[Kimigayo]]'', were written in the Heian period, as was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]], one of the first [[novel]]s ever written. [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s contemporary and rival Sei Sh\u014dnagon's revealing observations and musings as an attendant in the Empress' court were recorded collectively as ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' in the 990s, which revealed the quotidian capital lifestyle.<ref>Morris 1964 p. xiv.</ref>  The Heian period produced a flowering of poetry including works of [[Ariwara no Narihira]], [[Ono no Komachi]], [[Izumi Shikibu]], [[Murasaki Shikibu]], [[Saigy\u014d]] and [[Fujiwara no Teika]].  The famous Japanese poem known as the [[Iroha]] (\u3044\u308d\u306f), of uncertain authorship, was also written during the Heian period.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Beauty===\nDuring the Heian period, beauty was widely considered an important part of what made one a \"good\" person. In cosmetic terms, aristocratic men and women powdered their faces and blackened their teeth, the latter termed ''[[ohaguro]]''. The male courtly ideal included a faint [[mustache]] and thin [[goatee]], while women's mouths were painted small and red, and their eyebrows were plucked or shaved and redrawn higher on the forehead (''[[hikimayu]]'').{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nWomen cultivated shiny, black flowing hair and a courtly woman's formal dress included a complex \"twelve-layered robe\" called ''[[j\u016bnihitoe]]'', though the actual number of layers varied. Costumes were determined by office and season, with a woman's robes, in particular, following a system of color combinations representing flowers, plants, and animals specific to a season or month, (see the Japanese Wikipedia entries [[:ja:\u8272\u76ee|''irome'']] and [[:ja:\u8972\u306e\u8272\u76ee|''kasane-no-irome'']]).<ref>Toby 2009 p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Economics==\nWhile on one hand, the Heian period was an unusually long period of peace, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and was a fundamental base for their power.<ref name=\"Morris 1964 p.73\">Morris 1964 p. 73.</ref> The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the ''[[Japanese castes under the ritsury\u014d|Ry\u014dmin]]'' (\u826f\u6c11 \"Good People\") numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the [[samurai]] were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realized system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange.<ref name=\"Morris 1964 p.73\"/> The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time. For instance, messengers were rewarded with useful objects, e.g., an old silk [[kimono]], rather than paid a fee.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers. This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters. The [[sh\u014den]] system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the \"pursuit of arts\".<ref>Morris 1964 p. 79.</ref> The major Buddhist temples in [[Heian-ky\u014d]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] also made use of the [[sh\u014den]].<ref name=\"Collins 1997 p.851\">Collins 1997 p. 851.</ref> The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater \"organizational dynamism\".<ref name=\" Collins 1997 p.851\"/>\n\n==Events==\n* 784: [[Emperor Kanmu]] moves the capital to [[Nagaoka-ky\u014d]] (Ky\u014dto)\n* 794: Emperor Kanmu moves the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (Ky\u014dto)\n* 804: The Buddhist monk [[Saich\u014d]] (Dengyo Daishi) introduces the Tendai school\n* 806: The monk [[K\u016bkai]] (K\u014db\u014d-Daishi) introduces the [[Shingon]] (Tantric) school\n* 819: [[K\u016bkai]] founds the monastery of [[Mount K\u014dya]], in the northeast portion of modern-day [[Wakayama Prefecture]]\n* 858: [[Emperor Seiwa]] begins the rule of the [[Fujiwara clan]]<ref>Ponsonby-Fane 1962 pp. 203\u2013204; also known as ''Fujiwara jidai''.</ref>\n* 895: [[Sugawara no Michizane]] halted the [[imperial embassies to China]]\n* 990: [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]] writes the ''[[Pillow Book]]'' essays\n* 1000\u20131008: [[Murasaki Shikibu]] writes [[The Tale of Genji]] novel\n* 1050: Rise of the military class (samurai){{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* 1052: The [[By\u014dd\u014d-in|By\u014dd\u014d-in temple]] (near Ky\u014dto) is built by [[Fujiwara no Yorimichi]]<ref>''Britannica Kokusai Dai-Hyakkajiten''.</ref>\n* 1068: [[Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d]] overthrows the [[Fujiwara clan]]\n* 1087: [[Emperor Shirakawa]] abdicates and becomes a Buddhist monk, the first of the \"cloistered emperors\" (insei)\n* 1156: [[Taira no Kiyomori]] defeats the [[Minamoto clan]] and seizes power, thereby ending the \"insei\" era<ref>Ponsonby-Fane 1962 p. 204.</ref>\n* 1180 (June): The capital is moved to [[Fukuhara-ky\u014d]] ([[Kobe]])\n* 1180 (November): The capital is moved back to Heian-ky\u014d (Ky\u014dto)\n* 1185: Taira is defeated ([[Genpei War]]) and [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] with the support (backing) of the H\u014dj\u014d clan seizes power, becoming the first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of Japan, while the emperor (or \"mikado\") becomes a figurehead\n\n==Modern depictions==\nThe iconography of the Heian period is widely known in Japan, and depicted in various media, from traditional festivals to [[anime]].

Traditional horseback archery ([[yabusame]]) festivals, which date from the beginning of the Kamakura period (immediately following the Heian period) feature similar dress.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe two-volume historical novel saga ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress'' (2009),<ref>Fallingstar 2009.</ref> and ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Storm God'' (2011)<ref>Fallingstar 2011.</ref> depict in detail the pivotal years 1160\u20131185 in Japan, as seen through the eyes of protagonist Seiko Fujiwara.

It is the period in Japanese history when [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and other [[Chinese influence on Japanese culture|Chinese influences]] were at their height. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese [[Emperors of Japan|imperial court]] and noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], especially [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]]. Although the [[Imperial House of Japan]] had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the [[Fujiwara clan]], a powerful [[Kuge|aristocratic family]] who had intermarried with the [[Emperor of Japan|imperial family]]. Many emperors actually had mothers from the Fujiwara family.<ref name=Seal>Seal.</ref> {{nihongo|''Heian''|\u5e73\u5b89}} means \"peace\" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].\n\n==History==\nThe Heian period was preceded by the [[Nara period]] and began in 794 CE after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian-ky\u014d (present-day Ky\u014dto), by the 50th emperor, Emperor Kanmu <ref>Shively and McCullough 1999.</ref> Kanmu first tried to move the capital to [[Nagaoka-ky\u014d]], but a series of disasters befell the city, prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time, to Heian. A rebellion occurred in China in the last years of the 9th century, making the political situation unstable. The [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] were suspended and the influx of Chinese exports halted, a fact which facilitated the independent growth of Japanese culture called {{illm|Kokufu bunka|ja|\u56fd\u98a8\u6587\u5316|lt=''kokufu bunka''}}. Therefore, the Heian Period is considered a high point in Japanese culture that later generations have always admired. The period is also noted for the rise of the [[samurai]] class, which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of Japan.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNominally, sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact, power was wielded by the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] nobility. However, to protect their interests in the provinces, the Fujiwara, and other noble families required guards, police and soldiers. The warrior class made steady political gains throughout the Heian period.<ref name=Seal/> As early as 939 CE, [[Taira no Masakado]] threatened the authority of the central government, leading an uprising in the eastern province of [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]], and almost simultaneously, [[Fujiwara no Sumitomo]] rebelled in the west. Still, a true military takeover of the Japanese government was centuries away, when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe entry of the warrior class into court influence was a result of the [[H\u014dgen Rebellion]]. At this time [[Taira no Kiyomori]] revived the Fujiwara practices by placing his grandson on the throne to rule Japan by regency. Their clan, the [[Taira clan|Taira]], would not be overthrown until after the [[Genpei War]], which marked the start of the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. The [[Kamakura period]] began in 1185 when [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in Kamakura.<ref>''Ancient Japan''.</ref>\n\n===Fujiwara regency===\n[[File:Byodo-in Uji02pbs3400.jpg|thumb|[[By\u014dd\u014d-in]] Phoenix Hall, built in the 11th century during the Heian period of Japan]]\nWhen Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Heian-ky\u014d ([[Kyoto|Ky\u014dto]]), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years, he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically. Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of [[D\u014dky\u014d]] and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there.<ref>Hurst 2007 p. 32</ref> Ky\u014dto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces. The early Heian period (784\u2013967) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the [[China|Chinese]] [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] capital at [[Chang'an]],<ref>Takei and Keane 2001 p. 10.</ref> as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara.  Kanmu endeavored to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use.<ref>Hurst 2007 p. 34.</ref> Known as the [[ritsury\u014d]], this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan, despite the \"tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries\".<ref>Hurst 2007 p. 35.</ref> Despite the decline of the [[Taika Reform|Taika]]\u2013[[Taih\u014d Code|Taih\u014d]] reforms, imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Kanmu's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan's most forceful emperors.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAlthough Kanmu had abandoned universal conscription in 792, he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the [[Emishi]], possible descendants of the displaced [[J\u014dmon]], living in northern and eastern Japan. After making temporary gains in 794, in 797, Kanmu appointed a new commander, [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]], under the title ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun'' (\"Barbarian-subduing generalissimo\"). By 801, the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' had defeated the Emishi and had extended the imperial domains to the eastern end of [[Honsh\u016b]]. Imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best, however. In the ninth and tenth centuries, much authority was lost to the great families, who disregarded the Chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in Kyoto. Stability came to Japan, but, even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity, power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family, the Fujiwara which also helped Japan develop more.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[File:Genji emaki TAKEKAWA.jpg|thumb|A handscroll painting dated circa 1130, illustrating a scene from the \"Bamboo River\" chapter of the ''[[Tale of Genji]]'']]\nFollowing Kanmu's death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons, two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the [[Taika Reform|Taika]]\u2013[[Taih\u014d Code|Taih\u014d]] administrative structure. Through the new Emperor's Private Office, the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before. The new Metropolitan Police Board replaced the largely ceremonial imperial guard units. While these two offices strengthened the emperor's position temporarily, soon they and other Chinese-style structures were bypassed in the developing state. In 838 the end of the imperial-sanctioned missions to [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, which had begun in 630, marked the effective end of Chinese influence.<ref>Meyer p. 44.</ref> Tang China was in a state of decline, and Chinese Buddhists were severely persecuted, undermining Japanese respect for Chinese institutions. Japan began to turn inward.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAs the [[Soga clan]] had taken control of the throne in the sixth century, the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the [[Imperial Household of Japan|imperial family]], and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor's Private Office. Another Fujiwara became regent, [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|Sessh\u014d]] for his grandson, then a minor emperor and yet another was appointed [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|Kampaku]]. Toward the end of the 9th century, several emperors tried but failed, to check the Fujiwara. For a time, however, during the reign of [[Emperor Daigo]] (897\u2013930), the Fujiwara regency was suspended as he ruled directly.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNevertheless, the Fujiwara were not demoted by Daigo but actually became stronger during his reign. Central control of Japan had continued to decline, and the Fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger ''[[sh\u014den]]'' and greater wealth during the early tenth century. By the early Heian period, the ''sh\u014den'' had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the ''sh\u014den'' they held. Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to ''sh\u014den'' holders in return for a share of the harvest. People and lands were increasingly beyond central control and taxation, a ''de facto'' return to conditions before the [[Taika Reform]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[File: Fujiwara Michinaga.jpg|thumb|Drawing of [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], by [[Kikuchi Y\u014dsai]]]]\n[[File:HEIKE Lotus Sutra Prologue.JPG|thumb|HEIKE Lotus Sutra Prologue]]\nWithin decades of Daigo's death, the Fujiwara had absolute control over the court. By the year 1000, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will. Little authority was left for traditional institutions, and government affairs were handled through the Fujiwara clan's private administration. The Fujiwara had become what historian George B. Sansom has called \"hereditary dictators\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nDespite their usurpation of imperial authority, the Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and [[vernacular literature]]. Two types of phonetic Japanese script: [[katakana]], a simplified script that was developed by using parts of Chinese characters, was abbreviated to [[hiragana]], a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese. Hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan's famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late-tenth-century and early-11th-century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in ''[[Kager\u014d Nikki]]'' by \"the mother of [[Michitsuna no Haha|Fujiwara Michitsuna]]\", ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' by [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]] and ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored [[yamato-e]], Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid-to-late Heian period, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAs culture flourished, so did decentralization. Whereas the first phase of ''sh\u014den'' development in the early Heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions, the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial \"house governments\", as in the old clan system. In fact, the form of the old clan system had remained largely intact within the great old centralized government. New institutions were now needed in the face of social, economic, and political changes. The [[Taih\u014d Code]] lapsed, its institutions relegated to ceremonial functions. Family administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family. Land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy, not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of Japan as a single nation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Rise of the military class===\nUnder the early courts, when military [[conscription]] had been centrally controlled, military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy. But as the system broke down after 792, local power holders again became the primary source of military strength. The re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error. At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi, which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi, which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks. This gave rise to the Japanese military class. Nonetheless, final authority rested with the imperial court.<ref>Friday 1988 pp. 155\u2013170.</ref>\n\n''Sh\u014den'' holders had access to manpower and, as they obtained improved military technology (such as new training methods, more powerful bows, armor, horses, and superior swords) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century, military service became part of ''sh\u014den'' life. Not only the ''sh\u014den'' but also civil and religious institutions formed private guard units to protect themselves. Gradually, the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite of [[samurai]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBushi interests were diverse, cutting across old power structures to form new associations in the tenth century. Mutual interests, family connections, and kinship were consolidated in military groups that became part of family administration. In time, large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures. These military families gained prestige from connections to the imperial court and court-granted military titles and access to manpower. The Fujiwara family, Taira clan, and Minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nA decline in food production, the growth of the population, and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of Fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries. Members of the Fujiwara, Taira, and [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] families\u2014all of whom had descended from the imperial family\u2014attacked one another, claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land, set up rival regimes, and generally upset the peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d]] (1068\u20131073), the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century. Go-Sanjo, determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule, implemented reforms to curb Fujiwara influence. He also established an office to compile and validate [[Estate (house)|estate]] records with the aim of reasserting central control. Many ''sh\u014den'' were not properly certified, and large landholders, like the Fujiwara, felt threatened with the loss of their lands. Go-Sanjo also established the {{illm|In-no-ch\u014d|ja|\u9662\u5e81|lt=''In-no-ch\u014d''}} ({{lang|ja|\u9662\u5e81}} \"Office of the Cloistered Emperor\"), which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind-the-scenes governance, or ''[[Cloistered rule|insei]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe ''In-no-ch\u014d'' filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising [[Minamoto clan]]. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the ''insei'' system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne. The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the ''In-no-ch\u014d'' and of the rise of the military class throughout the country. Military might rather than civil authority dominated the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[File:DanNoUra.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] on 25 April 1185, [[Genpei War]]]]\n[[File:Map-of-Japan-1183-Heian-Genpei-War.png|thumb|Map of Japan in 1183 during the [[Genpei War]]]]\nA struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power. [[Fujiwara no Yorinaga]] sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1156 against the heir apparent, who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto ([[H\u014dgen Rebellion]]). In the end, the Fujiwara were destroyed, the old system of government supplanted, and the ''insei'' system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs, marking a turning point in Japanese history. In 1159, the Taira and Minamoto clashed ([[Heiji Rebellion]]), and a twenty-year period of Taira ascendancy began.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[Taira no Kiyomori]] emerged as the real power in Japan following the Fujiwara's destruction, and he would remain in command for the next 20 years. He gave his daughter [[Taira no Tokuko|Tokuko]] in marriage to the young [[emperor Takakura]], who died at only 19, leaving their infant son [[Antoku]] to succeed to the throne. Kiyomori filled no less than 50 government posts with his relatives, rebuilt the Inland Sea, and encouraged trade with Song China. He also took aggressive actions to safeguard his power when necessary, including the removal and exile of 45 court officials and the razing of two troublesome temples, Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe Taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}, where the Minamoto clan were rebuilding their strength. In 1183, two years after Kiyomori's death, Yoritomo Minamoto dispatched his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to attack Kyoto. The Taira were routed and forced to flee, and the Empress Dowager tried to drown herself and the 7-year old Emperor (he perished, but his mother survived). Takakura's other son succeeded as Emperor [[Go-Toba]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nWith Yoritomo firmly established, the ''bakufu'' system that governed Japan for the next seven centuries was in place. He appointed military governors, or ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', to rule over the provinces, and stewards, or ''jito'' to supervise public and private estates. Yoritomo then turned his attention to the elimination of the powerful Fujiwara family, which sheltered his rebellious brother Yoshitsune. Three years later, he was appointed ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in Kyoto. One year before his death in 1199, Yoritomo expelled the teenaged emperor Go-Toba from the throne. Two of Go-Toba's sons succeeded him, but they would also be removed by Yoritomo's successors to the shogunate.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Heian culture==\n\n===Developments in Buddhism===\n[[File:Danjogaran Koyasan12n3200.jpg|thumb|Danjogaran of [[Mount K\u014dya]]. The place is a center of the sacred ground of Shingon.]]\n[[File:Fugen enmei painting.jpg|thumb|''[[Samantabhadra|Bodhisattva Fugen Enmei]]'', 12th-century painting on silk, late Heian period]]\n[[File:Standing Komoku Ten (Virupakusa) Heian Period, 12th century.tiff|thumb|''Standing Komoku Ten'' (Virupakusa)]]\n[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saich\u014d]] was key to its transmission to Japan. Shingon is the Japanese transmission of the Chinese Chen Yen school.  Shingon, brought to Japan by the monk [[K\u016bkai]], emphasizes [[Vajrayana]].  Both K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy,<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 59.</ref> leading to the notion of \"aristocratic Buddhism\".<ref>Weinstein 1999.</ref>  An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to \"every creature\".<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 60.</ref> Saich\u014d also sought independent ordination for Tendai monks.<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 61.</ref>  A close relationship developed between the Tendai monastery complex on [[Mount Hiei]] and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain. As a result, Tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation. Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. K\u016bkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded Kanmu, and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture.  Shingon, through its use of \"rich symbols, rituals and [[mandala]]s\"<ref>Kitagawa 1966 p. 65.</ref> held a wide-ranging appeal.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Literature===\nAlthough written [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Kanbun]]) remained the official language of the Heian period imperial court, the introduction and widespread use of [[kana]] saw a boom in [[Japanese literature]]. Despite the establishment of several new literary genres such as the [[novel]] and narrative ''[[monogatari]]'' (\u7269\u8a9e) and essays, [[literacy]] was only common among the court and [[Buddhist]] clergy.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nPoetry, in particular, was a staple of court life. Nobles and ladies-in-waiting were expected to be well versed in the art of writing poetry as a mark of their status. Every occasion could call for the writing of a verse, from the birth of a child to the coronation of an emperor, or even a pretty scene of nature. A well-written poem could easily make or break one's reputation, and often was a key part of social interaction.<ref>Morris 1964 pp. 180, 182.</ref> Almost as important was the choice of calligraphy, or handwriting, used. The Japanese of this period believed handwriting could reflect the condition of a person's soul: therefore, poor or hasty writing could be considered a sign of poor breeding. Whether the script was Chinese or Japanese, good writing and artistic skill were paramount to social reputation when it came to poetry. [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]] mentions in her ''[[Pillow Book]]'' that when a certain courtier tried to ask her advice about how to write a poem to the Empress Sadako, she had to politely rebuke him because his writing was so poor.<ref>Morris 1964 pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\nThe lyrics of the modern Japanese national anthem, ''[[Kimigayo]]'', were written in the Heian period, as was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]], one of the first [[novel]]s ever written. [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s contemporary and rival Sei Sh\u014dnagon's revealing observations and musings as an attendant in the Empress' court were recorded collectively as ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' in the 990s, which revealed the quotidian capital lifestyle.<ref>Morris 1964 p. xiv.</ref>  The Heian period produced a flowering of poetry including works of [[Ariwara no Narihira]], [[Ono no Komachi]], [[Izumi Shikibu]], [[Murasaki Shikibu]], [[Saigy\u014d]] and [[Fujiwara no Teika]].  The famous Japanese poem known as the [[Iroha]] (\u3044\u308d\u306f), of uncertain authorship, was also written during the Heian period.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Beauty===\nDuring the Heian period, beauty was widely considered an important part of what made one a \"good\" person. In cosmetic terms, aristocratic men and women powdered their faces and blackened their teeth, the latter termed ''[[ohaguro]]''. The male courtly ideal included a faint [[mustache]] and thin [[goatee]], while women's mouths were painted small and red, and their eyebrows were plucked or shaved and redrawn higher on the forehead (''[[hikimayu]]'').{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nWomen cultivated shiny, black flowing hair and a courtly woman's formal dress included a complex \"twelve-layered robe\" called ''[[j\u016bnihitoe]]'', though the actual number of layers varied. Costumes were determined by office and season, with a woman's robes, in particular, following a system of color combinations representing flowers, plants, and animals specific to a season or month, (see the Japanese Wikipedia entries [[:ja:\u8272\u76ee|''irome'']] and [[:ja:\u8972\u306e\u8272\u76ee|''kasane-no-irome'']]).<ref>Toby 2009 p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Economics==\nWhile on one hand, the Heian period was an unusually long period of peace, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and was a fundamental base for their power.<ref name=\"Morris 1964 p.73\">Morris 1964 p. 73.</ref> The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the ''[[Japanese castes under the ritsury\u014d|Ry\u014dmin]]'' (\u826f\u6c11 \"Good People\") numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the [[samurai]] were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realized system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange.<ref name=\"Morris 1964 p.73\"/> The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time. For instance, messengers were rewarded with useful objects, e.g., an old silk [[kimono]], rather than paid a fee.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers. This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters. The [[sh\u014den]] system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the \"pursuit of arts\".<ref>Morris 1964 p. 79.</ref> The major Buddhist temples in [[Heian-ky\u014d]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] also made use of the [[sh\u014den]].<ref name=\"Collins 1997 p.851\">Collins 1997 p. 851.</ref> The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater \"organizational dynamism\".<ref name=\" Collins 1997 p.851\"/>\n\n==Events==\n* 784: [[Emperor Kanmu]] moves the capital to [[Nagaoka-ky\u014d]] (Ky\u014dto)\n* 794: Emperor Kanmu moves the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (Ky\u014dto)\n* 804: The Buddhist monk [[Saich\u014d]] (Dengyo Daishi) introduces the Tendai school\n* 806: The monk [[K\u016bkai]] (K\u014db\u014d-Daishi) introduces the [[Shingon]] (Tantric) school\n* 819: [[K\u016bkai]] founds the monastery of [[Mount K\u014dya]], in the northeast portion of modern-day [[Wakayama Prefecture]]\n* 858: [[Emperor Seiwa]] begins the rule of the [[Fujiwara clan]]<ref>Ponsonby-Fane 1962 pp. 203\u2013204; also known as ''Fujiwara jidai''.</ref>\n* 895: [[Sugawara no Michizane]] halted the [[imperial embassies to China]]\n* 990: [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]] writes the ''[[Pillow Book]]'' essays\n* 1000\u20131008: [[Murasaki Shikibu]] writes [[The Tale of Genji]] novel\n* 1050: Rise of the military class (samurai){{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* 1052: The [[By\u014dd\u014d-in|By\u014dd\u014d-in temple]] (near Ky\u014dto) is built by [[Fujiwara no Yorimichi]]<ref>''Britannica Kokusai Dai-Hyakkajiten''.</ref>\n* 1068: [[Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d]] overthrows the [[Fujiwara clan]]\n* 1087: [[Emperor Shirakawa]] abdicates and becomes a Buddhist monk, the first of the \"cloistered emperors\" (insei)\n* 1156: [[Taira no Kiyomori]] defeats the [[Minamoto clan]] and seizes power, thereby ending the \"insei\" era<ref>Ponsonby-Fane 1962 p. 204.</ref>\n* 1180 (June): The capital is moved to [[Fukuhara-ky\u014d]] ([[Kobe]])\n* 1180 (November): The capital is moved back to Heian-ky\u014d (Ky\u014dto)\n* 1185: Taira is defeated ([[Genpei War]]) and [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] with the support (backing) of the H\u014dj\u014d clan seizes power, becoming the first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of Japan, while the emperor (or \"mikado\") becomes a figurehead\n\n==Modern depictions==\nThe iconography of the Heian period is widely known in Japan, and depicted in various media, from traditional festivals to [[anime]]. In the [[manga]] and TV series [[Hikaru no Go]], the protagonist [[Hikaru Shindo]] is visited by a ghost of a [[go (game)|go]] genius from the Heian period and its leading clan, [[Fujiwara no Sai]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nVarious festivals feature Heian dress \u2013 most notably [[Hinamatsuri]] (doll festival), where the dolls wear Heian dress, but also numerous other festivals, such as [[Aoi Matsuri]] in [[Kyoto]] (May) and [[Sai\u014d Matsuri]] in [[Meiwa, Mie]] (June), both of which feature the [[j\u016bnihitoe]] 12-layer dress. Traditional horseback archery ([[yabusame]]) festivals, which date from the beginning of the Kamakura period (immediately following the Heian period) feature similar dress.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe two-volume historical novel saga ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress'' (2009),<ref>Fallingstar 2009.</ref> and ''White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Storm God'' (2011)<ref>Fallingstar 2011.</ref> depict in detail the pivotal years 1160\u20131185 in Japan, as seen through the eyes of protagonist Seiko Fujiwara. Both books were written by [[Cerridwen Fallingstar]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Games===\nThe game ''[[Total War: Shogun 2]]'' has the ''Rise of the Samurai'' expansion pack as a downloadable campaign. It allows the player to make their own version of the [[Genpei War]] which happened during the Heian period. The player is able to choose one of the most powerful families of Japan at the time, the Taira, Minamoto or Fujiwara; each family fielding two branches for a total of six playable clans. The expansion pack features a different set of land units, ships, and buildings and is also playable in the multiplayer modes.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n''[[Cosmology of Kyoto]]'' is a Japanese video game set in 10th \u2013 11th-century Japan. It is a point-and-click adventure game depicting [[Heian-ky\u014d]], including the religious beliefs, folklore, and ghost tales of the time.

Interactive kiosks are typically placed in high foot [[traffic]] settings such as shops, hotel lobbies or [[airport]]s.\n\nIntegration of technology allows kiosks to perform a wide range of functions, evolving into self-service kiosks. For example, kiosks may enable users to order from a shop's catalogue when items are not in stock, check out a library book, look up information about products, issue a hotel key card, enter a [[public utility]] bill account number in order to perform an online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise. Customised components such as coin hoppers, [[bill acceptor]]s, card readers and [[thermal printer]]s enable kiosks to meet the owner's specialised needs.\n\n==History==\nThe first self-service, interactive kiosk was developed in 1977 at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] by a pre-med student, Murray Lappe. The content was created on the PLATO computer system and accessible by plasma touch screen interface. The [[plasma display panel]] was invented at the University of Illinois by Donald L. Bitzer. Lappe's kiosk, called The Plato Hotline allowed students and visitors to find movies, maps, directories, bus schedules, extracurricular activities and courses. When it debuted in the U of Illinois Student Union in April 1977, more than 30,000 students, teachers and visitors stood in line during its first 6 weeks, to try their hand at a \"personal computer\" for the first time.\n\nThe first successful network of interactive kiosks used for commercial purposes was a project developed by the shoe retailer Florsheim Shoe Co., led by their executive VP, Harry Bock, installed circa 1985. The interactive kiosk was created, manufactured and customized by ByVideo Inc. of Sunnyvale, CA. The network of over 600 kiosks provided images and video promotion for customers who wished to purchase shoes that were not available in the retail location. Style, size and color could be selected, and the product paid for on the kiosk itself. The transaction was sent to the Florsheim mainframe in St, Louis, MO, via dialup lines, for next-day home or store delivery via Federal Express. The hardware (including microcomputer, display system, touchscreen) were designed and built by ByVideo, while other components (like the CRT, floppy disk, printer, keyboard and physical housing) were sourced from other vendors.

These can include [[email]], [[fax]], [[short message service|SMS]], as well as standard [[telephone]] service. The Telekiosk is rarely seen anymore.\n\nTelekiosks gradually appeared around the [[United Kingdom]] in the first years of the 21st century. Some are situated in shopping centres and transport terminals, with the intention of providing detailed local information. Others are in public places, including [[motorway service area]]s and airports.\n\nThe [[International Telecommunications Union]] is promoting the use of the telekiosk in Africa and parts of Asia where local people do not have access to [[communications technology]]. In part this work addresses the \"[[digital divide]]\" between rich and poor nations. There are, however, great practical benefits. The scheme in [[Bhutan]] aims to provide an [[E-Post]] system, whereby messages are relayed by telephone, then delivered by hand to rural areas, easing the problems of transporting letters across the countryside. Health, agricultural and educational information is also available.\n\n===Financial services kiosk===\nThe financial services kiosk can provide the ability for customers to perform transactions that may normally require a [[bank teller]] and may be more complex and longer to perform than desired at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. These are sometimes to referred to as \"bank-in-a-box\" and the first prime example would be the Vcom units deployed in 7-11 in U.S.\n\nThese units are generally referred to 'multi-function financial service kiosks' and the first iteration was back in late 1990s with the VCOM product deployed in Southland (7-Eleven) convenience stores. Check-cashing, bill-payment and even dispensing cashcards. New multi-function machines have been deployed in \"c-store\" markets supported by Speedway and others.\n\nBy 2010, the largest bill pay kiosk network is AT&T for the phone customers which allows customers to pay their phone bill. Verizon and Sprint have similar units for their customers.\n[[File:Kiosk self service payment.jpg|thumb|Payment kiosk]]\n\n===Photo kiosk===\nAn interactive kiosk which allows users to print pictures from their digital images. The marquee example began with Kodak who had at one point had over 100,000 units up and running in the U.S. Many of these units were customized PC's with an LCD which would then print to central printer in Customer service. Two major classes of photo kiosks exist:\n\n'''Digital Order Stations''' -- This type of photo kiosk exists within retail locations and allows users to place orders for prints and photographic products. Products typically get produced in-store by a digital minilab, or at another location to be shipped directly to the consumer, or back to the store to be picked up at a later time. Digital Order Stations may or may not support instant printing, and typically do not handle payments.\n\n'''Instant Print Stations''' - This type of photo kiosk uses internal printers to instantly create photographic prints for a self serve paying customer. Often located in public locations (hotels, schools, airports), Instant Print Stations handle payments. Often such systems will only print 4x6 inch prints, although popular dye sublimation photo printers as of 2008 allow for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8x12. It's more a matter of resupply labor economics and chassis size.\n\n===Internet kiosk===\nAn '''Internet kiosk''' is a terminal that provides public [[Internet]] access. Internet kiosks sometimes resemble telephone booths, and are typically placed in settings such as hotel lobbies, long-term care facilities, medical waiting rooms, apartment complex offices, or airports for fast access to [[e-mail]] or [[web pages]]. Internet kiosks sometimes have a bill acceptor or a [[credit card]] swipe, and nearly always have a computer keyboard, a mouse (or a fixed [[trackball]] which is more robust), and a monitor.\n\nSome Internet kiosks are based on a payment model similar to [[vending machine]]s or [[Internet cafe|Internet caf\u00e9]], while others are free. A common arrangement with pay-for-use kiosks has the owner of the Internet kiosk enter into a partnership with the owner of its location, paying either a flat rate for rental of the floor space or a percentage of the monthly revenue generated by the machine.\n\nOne of the first companies in North America to develop and deploy internet kiosks with touch screens via user login and password was [http://www.streetspace.com Streetspace] Inc. based out of San Francisco, California. Starting in 1999 they deployed internet kiosks across locations inside cafes, restaurants and record shops in Berkeley, California. Streetspace was also one of the first companies to roll-out targeted advertising and services to these internet kiosks based on the location of the kiosk and the profile of the user when they logged into the terminal.\n\nInternet kiosks have been the subject of hacker activity. Hackers will download spyware and catch user activity via [[keystroke logging]]. Other hackers have installed hardware keystroke logging devices that capture user activity.\n\nBusinesses that provide Internet kiosks are encouraged to use special Internet kiosk software and management procedures to reduce exposure to liability.\n\n===Ticketing kiosk===\n{{See also|Ticket machine}}\nMany amusement parks such as Disney have unattended outdoor ticketing kiosks.  Amtrak has automated self-service ticketing kiosks. Busch Gardens uses kiosks for amusement parks. Lisbon Oceanarium has self-servive ticketing kiosks by Partteam & Oemkiosks. Cruise ships use ticketing kiosks for passengers. Check-in Kiosks for auto rental companies such as Alamo and National have had national deployments.\nThe [[ticket hall]]s of [[train station]]s and [[metro station]]s have ticketing kiosks that sell [[transit pass]]es, [[train ticket]]s, [[Fare|transit tickets]], and [[train pass]]es.\n\n===Movie ticket kiosk===\nMany [[movie theater]] [[Chain store|chains]] have specialized [[ticket machine]]s that allow their customers to purchase tickets and/or pick up tickets that were purchased online. Radiant and Fujitsu have been involved in this segment.\n\n===Restaurant kiosk===\nA new way to order in-cafe from tablet kiosks. Kiosks are available in addition to cashier stations so that wait time is reduced for all guests. The kiosk is highly visual and includes a product builder to assist with order accuracy and customization.\n\n===DVD vending kiosk===\nAn example of a vending kiosk is that of the DVD rental kiosks manufactured by several manufacturers, where a user can rent a DVD, secured by credit card for $1 per day.\n\nOne of the larger DVD Vending Kiosks companies is [[Outerwall]], Inc who owns and operates the Redbox kiosks throughout North America. They also operate Coinstar kiosks as well.\n\n===Visitor management and security kiosk===\nA visitor management and security kiosk can facilitate the visitor check in process at businesses, schools, and other controlled access environments.  These systems can check against blacklists, run criminal background checks, and print access badges for visitors.  School security concerns in the United States have led to an increase in these types of kiosks to screen and track visitors.\n\n===Building directory and wayfinding kiosk===\nMany [[shopping mall]]s, hospitals,<ref>Raven, A., Laberge, J., Ganton, J. & Johnson, M., [http://uxpamagazine.org/wayfinding-in-a-hospital/ Wayfinding in a Hospital: Electronic Kiosks Point the Way], [http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/14-3/ UX Magazine 14.3], September 2014.</ref> airports and other large public buildings use interactive kiosks to allow visitors to navigate in buildings. [[Harris County Hospital District]], [[Baptist Hospital of Miami]], the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] and the [[Cayuga Medical Center]] are but a few medical centers utilizing interactive touch screen kiosks with a building directory and wayfinding solution.\n\n===Hospital and medical clinic registration and check-in kiosks===\nHospitals and medical clinics are looking to kiosks to allow patients to perform routine activities. Kiosks that allow patients to check in for their scheduled appointments and update their personal demographics reduce the need to line up and interact with a registration clerk. In areas where patients must make a co-pay, kiosks will also collect payment. As the requirements for documentation, waivers and consent increase, kiosks with integrated signature capture devices are able to present the documentation to the patient and collect their signature. A business case for registration and check-in kiosks is built around:\n# workload reduction,\n# data quality improvements,\n# consistency of registration process, and\n# patient experience improvement.\nA large community hospital has been able to reduce their registration staff by 30%, improve data quality, and shorten lineups.\n\nKiosks can display information customised to the user such as personalised messages helping them to manage their health.<ref>{{cite news |title=How self-service kiosks can transform the healthcare sector |url=https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.com/news/article_page/How_self-service_kiosks_can_transform_the_healthcare_sector/161298/cn164706 |accessdate=6 March 2020 |publisher=Building Better Healthcare |date=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Information kiosk===\nMuseums, historical sites, national parks and other tourist/visitor attractions often engage kiosks as a method for conveying information about a particular exhibit or site. Kiosks allow guests to read about - or view video of - particular artifacts or areas at their own pace and in an interactive manner, learning more about those areas that interest them most. The [[Rockwell Museum]] in [[New York City]] uses [[touchscreen]] tablets to  provide visitors with accessible and relevant labels for a particular exhibit. The [[Penn State]] All sports museum employs interactive kiosks to display up to date information about past and current Penn State athletes and sports teams. The [http://libertyellisfoundation.org/ Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration] now boasts a citizen test available for visitors to take online via an informational kiosk.  Additional kiosk displays include a \"Threads of Migration\" interactive exhibition featuring three touch-screen kiosks as part of \"The Journey: New Eras of Immigration\" section, which covers immigration since 1954.\n\n=== Video kiosk ===\nVideo kiosk integrates [[Videotelephony|video conferencing]] and [[Collaborative software|collaboration]] capabilities to help users run video calls or conferences with available operators, view content or exchange messages. Video kiosks are often used in banking<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://trueconf.com/blog/press-release/employee-free-bank-branch-powered-trueconf-video-conferencing.html|title=Employee-Free Bank Branch Powered by TrueConf - Video Conferencing Blog|date=2017-12-18|work=Video Conferencing Blog|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref> or telemedicine<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telacare.com/blog/telemedicine-kiosks-bring-doctors-and-patients-together-for-healthy-outcomes|title=Telemedicine Kiosks Bring Doctors And Patients Together For Healthy Outcomes|last=LLC|first=TelaCare Health Solutions|website=www.telacare.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> for improved customer service. \n\n==Kiosk reliability==\nReliability is an important consideration, and as a result many specialised [[kiosk software]] applications have been developed for the industry. These applications interface with the bill acceptor and credit card swipe, meter time, prevent users from changing the configuration of software or downloading [[computer virus]]es and allow the kiosk owner to see revenue. Threats to reliability come from vulnerabilities to hacking, allowing access to the OS, and the need for a session or hardware restart.\n\n==Kiosk industry segments==\nThe kiosk industry is divided into three segments: kiosk hardware, kiosk software, and kiosk application. Kiosk software locks down your operating system (be it [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Windows]], Android, or [[Linux]] or [[ChromeOS]]) to restrict access and/or functionality of a kiosk hardware device.  This allows for users to interact with an application that serves a self-service purpose such as those mentioned above.  \n \n===Kiosk manufacturing industry===\nHistorically electronic kiosks though are standalone enclosures which accept user input, integrate many devices, include a software GUI application and remote monitoring and are deployed widely across all industry verticals. This is considered \"Kiosk Hardware\" within the kiosk industry.\n\nPOS-related \"kiosks\" are \"lane busting\" check-outs such as seen at large retailers like Home Depot and Kroger.\n\nSimple touchscreen terminals or panel-pcs are another segment and enjoy most of their footprint in POS retail applications and typically facing the employee. Terminals include NCR Advantage (740x terminal) and the IBM Anyplace computer terminal. These units are considered \"kiosks\" only in functionality delivered and typically only incorporate touchscreen, bar code scanner and/or magnetic stripe reader.\n\nMarket segments for kiosk and self-service terminal manufacturers include photo kiosks, government, airlines, internet, music, retail loyalty, HR and financial services, just to name some.\n\n===Customer flow, queue and check-in===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}\nThis segment includes healthcare patient check-in and \"take a number\" type custom flow. Devices range from simple ticket dispense to biometrics (fingerprint readers) for patient check-in.\n\nThe basic application of kiosks in the hotel industry is to reduce waiting time for guests at check-in/checkout and relieve the reception desk. Usually, hotel kiosks are located in the lobby and are integrated or interface with the hotel's [[property management system]]. The machines allow guests to fill in and sign a registration card, select a room, issue hotel key cards, check for extra offers or upgrades and book and pay for them. \nIn retail, clients can place online orders in store for home delivery, avoid queuing in fast food restaurants and issue library books. Generally, kiosks are seen as an enhancement to a retail or hospitality offer rather than a replacing staff members.\n\n===See also===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Automated teller machine]]\n* [[Internet cafe]]\n* [[Kiosk]]\n* [[Kiosk software]]\n* [[Self service]]\n* [[Vending machine]]\n* [[Self-checkout]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n# \n# https://www.oemkiosks.com/blog/relation-millenials-self-service-kiosks/#.W92Lv1NUk0M\n# \n# https://www.oemkiosks.com/blog/touchscreen-technology-offers-interactivity-users/#.W-APtmj7SUk\n\n# \n{{Commons category|Interactive kiosk}}\n\n* {{FOLDOC}}\n\n[[Category:Advertising techniques]]\n[[Category:Advertising tools]]\n[[Category:Kiosks]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers|Kiosk]]\n[[Category:Commercial machines]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1977]]\n[[Category:Marketing techniques]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Sauerlandstammtisch-Infoterminal1-Asio.JPG|thumb|250px|An Internet kiosk in [[Hemer]], [[Germany]]]]\nAn '''interactive kiosk''' is a [[computer terminal]] featuring specialized hardware and software that provides access to information and applications for communication, commerce, entertainment, or education.\n\nEarly interactive kiosks sometimes resembled [[telephone booth]]s, but have been embraced by retail, food service and hospitality to improve customer service.  Interactive kiosks are typically placed in high foot [[traffic]] settings such as shops, hotel lobbies or [[airport]]s.\n\nIntegration of technology allows kiosks to perform a wide range of functions, evolving into self-service kiosks. For example, kiosks may enable users to order from a shop's catalogue when items are not in stock, check out a library book, look up information about products, issue a hotel key card, enter a [[public utility]] bill account number in order to perform an online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise. Customised components such as coin hoppers, [[bill acceptor]]s, card readers and [[thermal printer]]s enable kiosks to meet the owner's specialised needs.\n\n==History==\nThe first self-service, interactive kiosk was developed in 1977 at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] by a pre-med student, Murray Lappe. The content was created on the PLATO computer system and accessible by plasma touch screen interface. The [[plasma display panel]] was invented at the University of Illinois by Donald L. Bitzer. Lappe's kiosk, called The Plato Hotline allowed students and visitors to find movies, maps, directories, bus schedules, extracurricular activities and courses. When it debuted in the U of Illinois Student Union in April 1977, more than 30,000 students, teachers and visitors stood in line during its first 6 weeks, to try their hand at a \"personal computer\" for the first time.\n\nThe first successful network of interactive kiosks used for commercial purposes was a project developed by the shoe retailer Florsheim Shoe Co., led by their executive VP, Harry Bock, installed circa 1985. The interactive kiosk was created, manufactured and customized by ByVideo Inc. of Sunnyvale, CA. The network of over 600 kiosks provided images and video promotion for customers who wished to purchase shoes that were not available in the retail location. Style, size and color could be selected, and the product paid for on the kiosk itself. The transaction was sent to the Florsheim mainframe in St, Louis, MO, via dialup lines, for next-day home or store delivery via Federal Express. The hardware (including microcomputer, display system, touchscreen) were designed and built by ByVideo, while other components (like the CRT, floppy disk, printer, keyboard and physical housing) were sourced from other vendors. The videodisc material was created quarterly by ByVideo at Florsheim's direction, in ByVideo's state-of-the-art video production facility in CA. This kiosk network operated for over 6 years in Florsheim retail locations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn 1991, the first commercial kiosk with internet connection was displayed at Comdex.

Verizon and Sprint have similar units for their customers.\n[[File:Kiosk self service payment.jpg|thumb|Payment kiosk]]\n\n===Photo kiosk===\nAn interactive kiosk which allows users to print pictures from their digital images. The marquee example began with Kodak who had at one point had over 100,000 units up and running in the U.S. Many of these units were customized PC's with an LCD which would then print to central printer in Customer service. Two major classes of photo kiosks exist:\n\n'''Digital Order Stations''' -- This type of photo kiosk exists within retail locations and allows users to place orders for prints and photographic products. Products typically get produced in-store by a digital minilab, or at another location to be shipped directly to the consumer, or back to the store to be picked up at a later time. Digital Order Stations may or may not support instant printing, and typically do not handle payments.\n\n'''Instant Print Stations''' - This type of photo kiosk uses internal printers to instantly create photographic prints for a self serve paying customer. Often located in public locations (hotels, schools, airports), Instant Print Stations handle payments. Often such systems will only print 4x6 inch prints, although popular dye sublimation photo printers as of 2008 allow for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8x12. It's more a matter of resupply labor economics and chassis size.\n\n===Internet kiosk===\nAn '''Internet kiosk''' is a terminal that provides public [[Internet]] access. Internet kiosks sometimes resemble telephone booths, and are typically placed in settings such as hotel lobbies, long-term care facilities, medical waiting rooms, apartment complex offices, or airports for fast access to [[e-mail]] or [[web pages]]. Internet kiosks sometimes have a bill acceptor or a [[credit card]] swipe, and nearly always have a computer keyboard, a mouse (or a fixed [[trackball]] which is more robust), and a monitor.\n\nSome Internet kiosks are based on a payment model similar to [[vending machine]]s or [[Internet cafe|Internet caf\u00e9]], while others are free. A common arrangement with pay-for-use kiosks has the owner of the Internet kiosk enter into a partnership with the owner of its location, paying either a flat rate for rental of the floor space or a percentage of the monthly revenue generated by the machine.\n\nOne of the first companies in North America to develop and deploy internet kiosks with touch screens via user login and password was [http://www.streetspace.com Streetspace] Inc. based out of San Francisco, California. Starting in 1999 they deployed internet kiosks across locations inside cafes, restaurants and record shops in Berkeley, California. Streetspace was also one of the first companies to roll-out targeted advertising and services to these internet kiosks based on the location of the kiosk and the profile of the user when they logged into the terminal.\n\nInternet kiosks have been the subject of hacker activity. Hackers will download spyware and catch user activity via [[keystroke logging]]. Other hackers have installed hardware keystroke logging devices that capture user activity.\n\nBusinesses that provide Internet kiosks are encouraged to use special Internet kiosk software and management procedures to reduce exposure to liability.\n\n===Ticketing kiosk===\n{{See also|Ticket machine}}\nMany amusement parks such as Disney have unattended outdoor ticketing kiosks.  Amtrak has automated self-service ticketing kiosks. Busch Gardens uses kiosks for amusement parks. Lisbon Oceanarium has self-servive ticketing kiosks by Partteam & Oemkiosks. Cruise ships use ticketing kiosks for passengers. Check-in Kiosks for auto rental companies such as Alamo and National have had national deployments.\nThe [[ticket hall]]s of [[train station]]s and [[metro station]]s have ticketing kiosks that sell [[transit pass]]es, [[train ticket]]s, [[Fare|transit tickets]], and [[train pass]]es.\n\n===Movie ticket kiosk===\nMany [[movie theater]] [[Chain store|chains]] have specialized [[ticket machine]]s that allow their customers to purchase tickets and/or pick up tickets that were purchased online. Radiant and Fujitsu have been involved in this segment.\n\n===Restaurant kiosk===\nA new way to order in-cafe from tablet kiosks. Kiosks are available in addition to cashier stations so that wait time is reduced for all guests. The kiosk is highly visual and includes a product builder to assist with order accuracy and customization.\n\n===DVD vending kiosk===\nAn example of a vending kiosk is that of the DVD rental kiosks manufactured by several manufacturers, where a user can rent a DVD, secured by credit card for $1 per day.\n\nOne of the larger DVD Vending Kiosks companies is [[Outerwall]], Inc who owns and operates the Redbox kiosks throughout North America. They also operate Coinstar kiosks as well.\n\n===Visitor management and security kiosk===\nA visitor management and security kiosk can facilitate the visitor check in process at businesses, schools, and other controlled access environments.  These systems can check against blacklists, run criminal background checks, and print access badges for visitors.  School security concerns in the United States have led to an increase in these types of kiosks to screen and track visitors.\n\n===Building directory and wayfinding kiosk===\nMany [[shopping mall]]s, hospitals,<ref>Raven, A., Laberge, J., Ganton, J. & Johnson, M., [http://uxpamagazine.org/wayfinding-in-a-hospital/ Wayfinding in a Hospital: Electronic Kiosks Point the Way], [http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/14-3/ UX Magazine 14.3], September 2014.</ref> airports and other large public buildings use interactive kiosks to allow visitors to navigate in buildings. [[Harris County Hospital District]], [[Baptist Hospital of Miami]], the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] and the [[Cayuga Medical Center]] are but a few medical centers utilizing interactive touch screen kiosks with a building directory and wayfinding solution.\n\n===Hospital and medical clinic registration and check-in kiosks===\nHospitals and medical clinics are looking to kiosks to allow patients to perform routine activities. Kiosks that allow patients to check in for their scheduled appointments and update their personal demographics reduce the need to line up and interact with a registration clerk. In areas where patients must make a co-pay, kiosks will also collect payment. As the requirements for documentation, waivers and consent increase, kiosks with integrated signature capture devices are able to present the documentation to the patient and collect their signature. A business case for registration and check-in kiosks is built around:\n# workload reduction,\n# data quality improvements,\n# consistency of registration process, and\n# patient experience improvement.\nA large community hospital has been able to reduce their registration staff by 30%, improve data quality, and shorten lineups.\n\nKiosks can display information customised to the user such as personalised messages helping them to manage their health.<ref>{{cite news |title=How self-service kiosks can transform the healthcare sector |url=https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.com/news/article_page/How_self-service_kiosks_can_transform_the_healthcare_sector/161298/cn164706 |accessdate=6 March 2020 |publisher=Building Better Healthcare |date=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Information kiosk===\nMuseums, historical sites, national parks and other tourist/visitor attractions often engage kiosks as a method for conveying information about a particular exhibit or site. Kiosks allow guests to read about - or view video of - particular artifacts or areas at their own pace and in an interactive manner, learning more about those areas that interest them most. The [[Rockwell Museum]] in [[New York City]] uses [[touchscreen]] tablets to  provide visitors with accessible and relevant labels for a particular exhibit. The [[Penn State]] All sports museum employs interactive kiosks to display up to date information about past and current Penn State athletes and sports teams. The [http://libertyellisfoundation.org/ Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration] now boasts a citizen test available for visitors to take online via an informational kiosk.  Additional kiosk displays include a \"Threads of Migration\" interactive exhibition featuring three touch-screen kiosks as part of \"The Journey: New Eras of Immigration\" section, which covers immigration since 1954.\n\n=== Video kiosk ===\nVideo kiosk integrates [[Videotelephony|video conferencing]] and [[Collaborative software|collaboration]] capabilities to help users run video calls or conferences with available operators, view content or exchange messages. Video kiosks are often used in banking<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://trueconf.com/blog/press-release/employee-free-bank-branch-powered-trueconf-video-conferencing.html|title=Employee-Free Bank Branch Powered by TrueConf - Video Conferencing Blog|date=2017-12-18|work=Video Conferencing Blog|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}</ref> or telemedicine<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telacare.com/blog/telemedicine-kiosks-bring-doctors-and-patients-together-for-healthy-outcomes|title=Telemedicine Kiosks Bring Doctors And Patients Together For Healthy Outcomes|last=LLC|first=TelaCare Health Solutions|website=www.telacare.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> for improved customer service. \n\n==Kiosk reliability==\nReliability is an important consideration, and as a result many specialised [[kiosk software]] applications have been developed for the industry. These applications interface with the bill acceptor and credit card swipe, meter time, prevent users from changing the configuration of software or downloading [[computer virus]]es and allow the kiosk owner to see revenue. Threats to reliability come from vulnerabilities to hacking, allowing access to the OS, and the need for a session or hardware restart.\n\n==Kiosk industry segments==\nThe kiosk industry is divided into three segments: kiosk hardware, kiosk software, and kiosk application. Kiosk software locks down your operating system (be it [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Windows]], Android, or [[Linux]] or [[ChromeOS]]) to restrict access and/or functionality of a kiosk hardware device.  This allows for users to interact with an application that serves a self-service purpose such as those mentioned above.  \n \n===Kiosk manufacturing industry===\nHistorically electronic kiosks though are standalone enclosures which accept user input, integrate many devices, include a software GUI application and remote monitoring and are deployed widely across all industry verticals. This is considered \"Kiosk Hardware\" within the kiosk industry.\n\nPOS-related \"kiosks\" are \"lane busting\" check-outs such as seen at large retailers like Home Depot and Kroger.\n\nSimple touchscreen terminals or panel-pcs are another segment and enjoy most of their footprint in POS retail applications and typically facing the employee. Terminals include NCR Advantage (740x terminal) and the IBM Anyplace computer terminal. These units are considered \"kiosks\" only in functionality delivered and typically only incorporate touchscreen, bar code scanner and/or magnetic stripe reader.\n\nMarket segments for kiosk and self-service terminal manufacturers include photo kiosks, government, airlines, internet, music, retail loyalty, HR and financial services, just to name some.\n\n===Customer flow, queue and check-in===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}\nThis segment includes healthcare patient check-in and \"take a number\" type custom flow. Devices range from simple ticket dispense to biometrics (fingerprint readers) for patient check-in.\n\nThe basic application of kiosks in the hotel industry is to reduce waiting time for guests at check-in/checkout and relieve the reception desk. Usually, hotel kiosks are located in the lobby and are integrated or interface with the hotel's [[property management system]]. The machines allow guests to fill in and sign a registration card, select a room, issue hotel key cards, check for extra offers or upgrades and book and pay for them. \nIn retail, clients can place online orders in store for home delivery, avoid queuing in fast food restaurants and issue library books. Generally, kiosks are seen as an enhancement to a retail or hospitality offer rather than a replacing staff members.\n\n===See also===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Automated teller machine]]\n* [[Internet cafe]]\n* [[Kiosk]]\n* [[Kiosk software]]\n* [[Self service]]\n* [[Vending machine]]\n* [[Self-checkout]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n# \n# https://www.oemkiosks.com/blog/relation-millenials-self-service-kiosks/#.W92Lv1NUk0M\n# \n# https://www.oemkiosks.com/blog/touchscreen-technology-offers-interactivity-users/#.W-APtmj7SUk\n\n# \n{{Commons category|Interactive kiosk}}\n\n* {{FOLDOC}}\n\n[[Category:Advertising techniques]]\n[[Category:Advertising tools]]\n[[Category:Kiosks]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers|Kiosk]]\n[[Category:Commercial machines]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1977]]\n[[Category:Marketing techniques]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "name_user": "Therealnewbook", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_kiosk"}

Women's Championship''' until 2015) is an international [[Women's association football|women's football]] competition held every two years and sanctioned by the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF). It was first contested in [[1991 African Women's Championship|1991]], but was not held biennially until [[1998 African Women's Championship|1998]]. [[Nigeria women's national football team|Nigeria]] is the most successful nation in the tournament's history, having won a record 10 titles, meaning they have won all but two of the previous tournaments. The two tournaments ''not'' won by Nigeria were both won by [[Equatorial Guinea women's national football team|Equatorial Guinea]].  For both those times, Equatorial Guinea hosted the competition. Ghana hosted the tournament in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cameroon-info.net/stories/0,52219,@,football-le-cameroun-va-abriter-la-can-feminine-2016.html |title=Football: Le Cameroun va abriter la CAN f\u00e9minine 2016 |work=cameroon-info.net |publisher=Christian Tchapmi |date=September 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018191022/http://www.cameroon-info.net/stories/0%2C52219%2C%40%2Cfootball-le-cameroun-va-abriter-la-can-feminine-2016.html |archive-date=2014-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe competition has served as a qualifying tournament for the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] every other tournament since its inception in 1991.\n\n==History==\nIn 2000, hosts [[South Africa women's national football team|South Africa]] met three-time champions [[Nigeria women's national football team|Nigeria]] in the final game of the tournament. After Nigeria finished the first half ahead 1\u20130, Nigeria's [[Stella Mbachu]] scored a second goal in the 72nd minute and the home crowd realized there was no coming back. Supporters began hurling bottles and other debris at officials and Nigerian players. The match was abandoned after three attempts at restarts were all interrupted by further disturbances. Riot police began fighting battles with bottle-throwing supporters about 40 minutes after the goal had been allowed, throwing tear gas into the crowd to break up the disturbance. The game and the tournament were awarded to Nigeria. In 2020, the 2021 qualifiers , which were slated from 8<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> of March 2020 were postponed. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/sports/sports-news/caf-postpones-2021-afcon-qualifiers.html|title=CAF postpones 2021 AFCON

Often described as \"the Olympics of the [[art world]]\", participation in the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\nOutside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\n== Giardini national pavilions ==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Nation\n!

Some countries own pavilion buildings in the [[Giardini della Biennale]] while others rent buildings throughout the city, but each country controls its own selection process and production costs.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe Venice Biennale is an international [[art biennial]] exhibition held in [[Venice, Italy]]. Often described as \"the Olympics of the [[art world]]\", participation in the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\nOutside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\n== Giardini national pavilions ==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Nation\n!

DeHaan, Giamatti, Jones, and Cooper were cast between December 2012 and February 2013. Filming took place in [[New York City]] from February to June 2013. The film was released in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] on May 2, 2014, in the United States with two international premieres being held between March 31 and April 10 of that year. It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed $709 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2014]], but the second-lowest-grossing Spider-Man film to date.\n\n''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' was originally envisioned as the beginning of a shared fictional universe, which would have continued with two sequels and several spin-offs, most notably films centered on [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the [[Sinister Six]]. Due to performing below expectations, all subsequent installments were cancelled and a [[Reboot (fiction)|new iteration]] of the character, portrayed by [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), began with the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. The planned spin-offs were re-purposed for a [[Sony's Marvel Universe|timeline separate from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' continuity and the MCU]], beginning with 2018's [[Venom (2018 film)|''Venom'']], the upcoming 2020's ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' & ''[[Venom 2]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Oscorp]] scientist Richard Parker records a video message to explain his disappearance. Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by an assassin sent to kill Richard and his wife. Richard and Mary fight off the man, but the ensuing struggle causes the plane to crash, killing both Richard and Mary, after he uploads the video.\n\nIn the present time, Richard's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as [[Spider-Man]]. He pursues and apprehends [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Later, Peter meets with his girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]] at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her late father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, [[Harry Osborn]], returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]], CEO of Oscorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new Oscorp CEO.\n\nWhile working in an Oscorp laboratory, electrical engineer [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon]] shocks himself by accident and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered [[electric eel]]s. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England if she earns a scholarship to [[Oxford University]]. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into [[Times Square]], accidentally causing a blackout, and is stopped by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to the Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist [[Dr. Kafka]]. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry becomes resentful towards Spider-Man. Oscorp vice-president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, removes him as CEO and takes control of Oscorp. Harry's assistant, [[Felicia Hardy]], informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself \"Electro,\" to get him back inside the Oscorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harry's illness, and transforms him into a [[Green Goblin|goblin-like creature]], but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health and cures his disease.\n\nPeter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the Oxford scholarship, and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He catches her and professes his love for her, and they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to battle him as Spider-Man. Gwen follows, and together, they restore power, and [[overcurrent|overload]] Electro's body, killing him.\n\nThe transformed Harry, who now calls himself \"Green Goblin\", arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry. Upon seeing Gwen, he deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her and takes her to the top of a clock tower. Spider-Man defeats Harry, but his webbing breaks during the battle, and Gwen falls. Peter tries but is unable to save her. Mourning her death,  the depressed Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.\n\nFive months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, [[The Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers]], visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own [[Sinister Six|team]]. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him.\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ABOUT THE X-MEN MID CREDIT SCENE.

DeHaan, Giamatti, Jones, and Cooper were cast between December 2012 and February 2013. Filming took place in [[New York City]] from February to June 2013. The film was released in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] on May 2, 2014, in the United States with two international premieres being held between March 31 and April 10 of that year. It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed $709 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2014]], but the second-lowest-grossing Spider-Man film to date.\n\n''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' was originally envisioned as the beginning of a shared fictional universe, which would have continued with two sequels and several spin-offs, most notably films centered on [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the [[Sinister Six]]. Due to performing below expectations, all subsequent installments were cancelled and a [[Reboot (fiction)|new iteration]] of the character, portrayed by [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), began with the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. The planned spin-offs were re-purposed for a [[Sony's Marvel Universe|timeline separate from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' continuity and the MCU]], beginning with 2018's [[Venom (2018 film)|''Venom'']], the upcoming 2020's ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' & ''[[Venom 2]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Oscorp]] scientist Richard Parker records a video message to explain his disappearance. Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by an assassin sent to kill Richard and his wife. Richard and Mary fight off the man, but the ensuing struggle causes the plane to crash, killing both Richard and Mary, after he uploads the video.\n\nIn the present time, Richard's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as [[Spider-Man]]. He pursues and apprehends [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Later, Peter meets with his girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]] at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her late father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, [[Harry Osborn]], returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]], CEO of Oscorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new Oscorp CEO.\n\nWhile working in an Oscorp laboratory, electrical engineer [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon]] shocks himself by accident and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered [[electric eel]]s. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England if she earns a scholarship to [[Oxford University]]. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into [[Times Square]], accidentally causing a blackout, and is stopped by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to the Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist [[Dr. Kafka]]. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry becomes resentful towards Spider-Man. Oscorp vice-president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, removes him as CEO and takes control of Oscorp. Harry's assistant, [[Felicia Hardy]], informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself \"Electro,\" to get him back inside the Oscorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harry's illness, and transforms him into a [[Green Goblin|goblin-like creature]], but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health and cures his disease.\n\nPeter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the Oxford scholarship, and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He catches her and professes his love for her, and they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to battle him as Spider-Man. Gwen follows, and together, they restore power, and [[overcurrent|overload]] Electro's body, killing him.\n\nThe transformed Harry, who now calls himself \"Green Goblin\", arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry. Upon seeing Gwen, he deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her and takes her to the top of a clock tower. Spider-Man defeats Harry, but his webbing breaks during the battle, and Gwen falls. Peter tries but is unable to save her. Mourning her death,  the depressed Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.\n\nFive months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, [[The Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers]], visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own [[Sinister Six|team]]. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him.\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ABOUT THE X-MEN MID CREDIT SCENE.
