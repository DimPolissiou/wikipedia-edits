Originally [[subcompact car|subcompact]] in classification, for [[model year]] 2000 it was reclassified as a [[compact car]]. Until 2006, Sentra was a rebadged export version of the Japanese [[Nissan Sunny]], but since the 2013 model year, Sentra is a rebadged export version of the [[Nissan Sylphy#B17|Nissan Sylphy B17]]. The Sentra nameplate is not used in Japan. Many other countries in South America sell their versions of the Sunny as the Sentra. In Mexico, the first three generations of the Sentra were known as the '''Nissan Tsuru''' (Japanese for [[red-crowned crane|crane]]), and the B13 model was sold under that name until 2017, alongside the updated models badged as Sentra.\n\nIn North America, the Sentra currently serves as Nissan's compact car, despite being rated as a [[mid-size car]] by the [[EPA]] due to its interior volume since the 2007 model year. While previous Sentras were subcompacts, the Sentra has grown over the years, with the [[Nissan Versa]] having replaced the Sentra in the entry-level area.\n\nThe Sentra name was created for Nissan by Ira Bachrach of Namelab, and Bachrach describes the origin as \"Nissan wanted consumers to understand that it was quite safe even though it was small. The word Sentra sounds like central as well as sentry, which evokes images of safety.\"<ref name = CSMonitor>{{cite web |last=Holmstrom |first=David |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0917/dname.html |title=Coining words for new products is name of Ira Bachrach's game |accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|B11}} B11 (1982) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (B11)\n| image = 1st-Nissan-Sentra-sedan.jpg\n| aka = \n| production = 1982\u20131986\n| assembly = Japan: [[Zama, Kanagawa]]<ref name = \"smyr\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SD0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5403,7068460 \"Nissan building popular Sentras in Smyrna, Tenn.\"], ''Reading Eagle'', p.55, May 29, 1985.

The B12 chassis was first produced and marketed in 1985 in most parts of the world; however, it was not offered to the United States until 1986. For the 1987 model, all Sentras came standard with the [[Nissan E engine|E16]] engine with {{convert|69|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (excepting the Sport Coup\u00e9 and four-wheel-drive wagon, which came with throttle-body-injected E16i engines) and a five-speed [[manual transmission]]. In 1988, all Sentras had the {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} E16i, which was offered for this year with throttle body injection (TBI). In many parts of the world the E-series soldiered on in the B12 chassis with some getting the multi-point [[fuel injection]] E16E engine. Diesel engines were also offered in some models, but were rare and only available in North American 1987 models and in certain other parts of the world. From 1989 to 1990, the only engine choice was the {{convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Nissan GA engine|GA16i]], a 12-valve SOHC predecessor of the [[GA16DE]]. Transaxles offered were the 4- and 5-speed manuals (RN4F31A and RS5F31A, respectively) and a 3-speed automatic with torque converter lockup (RL3F01A).\n\nThe B12 carried over a radically modified 4-wheel independent suspension from the B11, with 4-wheel disc brakes an option in some parts of the world. This was the start of the model classes which were standard through the 2003 model year (not all classes were available every year) having the '''E''' as the base-level economy car, the '''XE''' as the next-up model, the '''GXE''' as the top level for the 4-door sedan, the sporty '''SE''' coupe, and the '''SE-R''' (Not available in the US market) as the top of the line performance model. The GXE (available from 1987 to 2003) had a body colored bumper, aero side mirrors with manual remote control, tachometer as well as standard 13\" 175/70R13 alloy wheels along with air-conditioning, variable intermittent wipers, but no standard cassette deck nor any power windows/locks/mirrors. The SE also had dual [[mirror]]s, air conditioning, tachometer, and power door locks and [[window]]s in some markets and possibly electronic fuel injection.\n\nThe B12 chassis would be the last chassis to offer a station wagon model, which was marketed as the \"California\" in some Asian markets. Even more rare are the [[four-wheel drive]] versions of the station wagon, offered as an option in 1987, 1988 and 1989 model years. These models featured an electrically activated single-range transfer case to drive the independently suspended rear wheels, making the car a selectable four-wheel-drive (not all-wheel-drive) vehicle.\n\n1989 saw a subtle change in the body style of the Sentra sedan, as new larger, more rounded front corner lights were introduced to the front fenders and redesigned taillights were added to the rear fascia (station wagon retained same rear lights). The Nissan logo on the front grille was relocated from the right hand side to the center. In 1990, electrically retracted front shoulder belts were added, as well as 3-point harnesses for the rear passengers, excluding the center rear passenger.\n\nThe Sport Coupe was a sportier style of the Sentra. It shared none of the body components with the standard model. It was only available with the E16i or GA16i. All Sport Coupes had dual sway bars, dual remote-adjust mirrors, and a tachometer instrument cluster. The SE model added features like air conditioning and rear speakers. All B12 Sentras used the same wiring harness, regardless of options installed on any particular vehicle.\n\nB12s are known for reliability and excellent fuel economy, and are considered by enthusiasts to be good low budget project cars due to interchangeability of parts between generations and with other Nissan models.\n\nIn Canada, the B12 four-door sedan remained available through the 1993 model year. Essentially a rebadged Nissan Tsuru II built in Mexico, it was called ''Sentra Classic'' to distinguish it from the B13 model released for 1991. It replaced the [[Nissan Micra]] 3/5-door [[hatchback]]s which were discontinued that time as a price-leader model. All 1991\u201393 \"Classic\" models came with the {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} E16i and the choice of two transmissions, a 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]].\n\n===Latin America===\nIn Mexico, it was named the Nissan Tsuru II, available in 2, 4 door sedans and wagon, while the Coup\u00e9 was named the Nissan Hikari. They were produced and marketed locally between 1988 and 1991. For 1988 for the 4 door Tsuru II and the Hikari had available the Turbo EGI (fuel injected) 1.6 L engine in a very rare, sporty version. It was one of the most reliable cars in its time in Mexico, being a great sales success. This generation was also exported to some Central and South American markets such as Peru, Chile and Bolivia. In Chile the Mexican-made car received \"Sentra\" badging and was available from October 1987 until 1993.<ref name=VeoB12>{{cite web | url = http://www.veoautos.cl/nissan-sentra-nacido-como-sunny-b12-ingreso-a-chile-el-ano-1987/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190804210558/http://www.veoautos.cl/nissan-sentra-nacido-como-sunny-b12-ingreso-a-chile-el-ano-1987/ | archivedate = 2019-08-04 | title = Nissan Sentra: Nacido como Sunny B12 ingres\u00f3 a Chile el a\u00f1o 1987 | trans-title = Nissan Sentra: Born as the Sunny B12 it entered Chile in 1987 | work = VeoAutos.cl | language = es | date = 2018-11-21 }}</ref> The Sentra was the most sold car in the country in 1991 and 1992.<ref name=VeoB12/>\n\nIn the Philippines, it was initially offered in three trims namely the 1.7 DX (diesel), 1.3 SLX and the 1.5 SGX, the wagon version was also available in the 1.5 SGX trim and was called the Nissan California.

The 1.6 SGX gained power steering, windows, door locks and side mirrors, a first in its class. The second-generation B12 also had a diesel variant which had the 1.7 CD17 engine.

The Super Saloon had all power features. The SE-Saloon came as a Limited edition equipped with four-wheel disc brakes and ABS. Both SE and Super Saloon come standard with the GA16DE.\n\nThe B13 SuperSaloon and SE Saloon came with the GA16DE fuel-injected engine (top of the line engine for the Philippine market) which is comparable to the U.S Spec B13 SE Limited with loaded options. These models are not equipped with emissions equipment \u2013 catalytic converters and sensors as well as EGR. B13's where sold new from 1990 to 1999. The LEC version comes with the standard GA13 carburated engine as well as the LEC Ps (Power Steering model). The JX comes with the GA14 carburated engine.\n\n===Nissan Tsuru/V16/Sentra (1992\u20132017) {{anchor|tsuru}}===\nThe Mexican-built Sentra B13 was sold in Mexico for 25 years as well as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Central America and South America. It is known as the '''Nissan Tsuru''' in Mexico, '''Nissan V16''' in Chile, '''Sentra B13''' in Central and South America countries. and '''Sentra Cl\u00e1sico''' in Peru and the Dominican Republic. Tsuru vehicles destined for the Mexican market were modified by Nissan Mexicana specifically for the Mexican market and for the most part are identical to the 1991 model except for a new Renault clutch/transmission, updated Mexican made electronic systems and minor cosmetic and ergonomic upgrades.\n\nThe Tsuru was the most popular car in Mexico from 1997 until 2011 when it was surpassed by the Mexican made Volkswagen Jetta. The Middle East/African export market version is the same basic car only with minor cosmetic changes and mechanical downgrades to make it cheaper, such as non-power steering, downgraded interior trim, a downgraded braking system, and a mechanical clutch instead of a hydraulic one.\n\nVehicles sold in the Middle East region are not equipped with [[catalytic converter]]s to make the car cheaper to build.<ref>http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2013/2/19/Cars-That-Won-t-Die-Nissan-Tsuru-7713035/</ref> Because of the lack of the catalytic converter the vehicles are illegal in Mexico and South America. More recent models have received a [[Renault]]-built hydraulic clutch and an optional catalytic converter. Its affordable price, relatively good fuel economy, easy to fix and find spare parts make it popular among local taxi drivers and low income families in Mexico, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Tsuru is commonly used for the [[taxicab livery]] in Mexico as a replacement for the VW Beetle \u2013 much like its predecessor, Tsurus have been sighted in the Southwest United States since Mexican nationals can operate them in the USA as long as it has the valid registration documents (they are illegal for sale and/or export into the USA since it does not meet the DOT's safety requirements e.g. airbags and electronic stability control and are [[Grey import vehicle#United States|less than 25 years old]]). Due to the passing of stricter automobile safety regulations in Mexico, production of the Tsuru was discontinued in May 2017, as the Tsuru lacked both anti-lock brakes and airbags.<ref name=\"Woodard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/news/a30437/nissan-b13-sentra-cancelled/|title=The 1991 Nissan Sentra Is Finally Going Out of Production|last=Woodard|first=Collin|date=August 17, 2016|work=[[Road & Track]]|publisher=[[Hearst (media)|Hearst Digital Media]]|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> A special commemorative edition limited to 1000 cars went on sale in March 2017.<ref name=\"tsuru2017\" />\n\n{{gallery | width = 185 | height = 118\n|File:Nissan Tsuru B13.jpg|Pre-facelift B13 Nissan Tsuru\n|File:'03-'04 Nissan Tsuru.jpg|2002\u20132004 Nissan Tsuru\n|File:Nissan Tsuru B-13.jpg|2005\u20132017 Nissan Tsuru\n|File:Nissan_Tsuru_Taxi.jpg|Nissan Tsuru taxi in [[Cancun]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|B14}}B14 (1995)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|platform=[[Nissan B platform]]\n|name=Fourth generation\n|image=1995-1997 Nissan Sentra -- 03-21-2012.JPG\n|production={{ubl\n  | November 1994 \u2013 December 1999\n  | 1995 - 2002 (Philippines)\n  }}\n|engine=1.6 L ''[[Nissan GA engine#GA16DE|GA16DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE|SR20DE]]'' I4\n|wheelbase= {{convert|99.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=1995\u201396: {{convert|170.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1997\u201399: {{convert|171.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|aka=[[Nissan Sunny#B14|Nissan Sunny (B14)]]<br />[[Nissan Lucino]]/200SX<br />[[Nissan Presea]]\n|layout=[[FF layout]]\n|width= {{convert|66.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|assembly=[[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]], [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]], Japan<br>[[Smyrna, Tennessee]]<br />[[Aguascalientes]], Mexico<br />[[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]<br />[[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://car-cat.com/firm-797.html |title=Nissan.

Some variants were not equipped with a rear swaybar or rear disc brakes. Many of these vehicles equipped with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine that had Nissan's Variable Intake Valve Timing Control System (NVTCS) and standard 5-speed manual transmission can achieve upwards of 30\u201340 MPG depending on conditions. This generation is also the first generation in Mexico wearing the '''Sentra''' name. It is also the first Sentra generation exclusively sold in sedan form, as the coupe was dropped in favour of the [[Nissan 200SX]] reintroduction. The revived 200SX also replaced the related [[Nissan NX]].\n\nAll engines in the B14 line up came with timing chains, designed to last the vehicle's lifetime.\n\nThe B14 sentra platform was offered several trims, Base, XE, GXE, GLE, SE and SE Limited. Base and XE come with 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, GXE prior to 1998 also included 13-inch wheels. The only difference between trims is the GXE and up come with rear seat trunk access, rear headrests, a grip-assist handle on the passenger side, additional fabric on doors and seats as opposed to vinyl, power windows, locks, mirrors, etc. The GLE, SE, and Special Edition include in some instances leather, rear spoiler and moonroof, and keyless entry packages. All trims except the SE and SE-R have the [[GA16DE]] 1.6&nbsp;L engine producing {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|108|lbft|Nm|0}}. The SE and SE-R received the SR20DE 2.0L engine with {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The 200SX SE-R came with leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob and even Limited-Slip-Differential until 1997.\n\n===SE===\nThe sedan got all the performance parts (minus the limited-slip differential) in 1998 with the Sentra SE. The SE sedan came with the same 2.0-liter SR20DE engine as the SE-R. This generation saw the end of assembly in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]].\n\n===Engines===\n* GA16DE: 1.6 (1,597&nbsp;cc) DOHC with a 6,900&nbsp;rpm redline and {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm, 110&nbsp;lb.ft at 4,000&nbsp;rpm, available in 5-speed manual/4-speed automatic; 30/40mpg 5sp. man., 28/37 4sp. auto.

When new, this redesign was considered a substantial upgrade, compared to the \"cheap\" economy car it replaced. Previously, the compact class had been occupied by the [[Nissan Altima|Altima]], which moved to the [[mid-size]] class in 2001, and its wheelbase remained unchanged from the previous generation. While earlier Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series [[Nissan Sunny]] twins, the B15 Sentra diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny (Nissan Super Sunny). Production shifted from [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] to [[Aguascalientes]], Mexico, and the Smyrna production line was retooled to build the [[Nissan Xterra]]. The 2000\u20132001 Sentra SE with the SR20DE [[Roller rocker]] motor, which has {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|136|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, occupied the top of the line Sentra until the SE-R returned for model year 2002.

With the introduction of the B15 in year 2000, Nissan also introduced a CA 'Clean Air' trim only available in California. The CA trim boasts a double walled exhaust, 3 catalytic converters, quick catalyst warm up, and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone (smog) into oxygen. The Sentra CA model is the only gasoline-fueled vehicle in the world to receive California Air Resources Board (CARB) super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) certification and obtain zero-emission credits.<ref>[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/20000111/press005749.html \"2000 Nissan Sentra CA Claims Title As the Cleanest Gasoline-Fueled Car\"], ''The Auto Channel'', January 2000. Retrieved May 27, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn markets where the B15 Sentra or Sunny was not sold, Nissan usually sold a similar car called the [[Nissan Sylphy#G10|Nissan Bluebird Sylphy (G10/N16)]] in Japan but under other names elsewhere. In Europe, the Bluebird Sylphy was known as the [[Nissan Almera#N16|Nissan Almera (N16)]] and Australia and New Zealand as the [[Nissan Pulsar#N16|Nissan Pulsar (N16)]]. The G10/N16 is constructed on the same platform as the B15 and features the same interior and engines.\n\n===Sentra SE-R===\n[[File:2002-2003 Nissan Sentra SE-R.jpg|thumb|left|2002\u20132003 Nissan Sentra SE-R]]\n\nIn 2001 for the 2002 model year, a new SE-R was introduced powered by the 2.5-liter ''[[Nissan QR engine|QR25DE]]'' {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|lbft|Nm|0}} [[4-cylinder]]. The SE-R came with a 5-speed RS5F51A manual transmission or optional 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. The 5-speed manual was dropped in 2003 models, which consequently made the only available transmission a 4-speed automatic.\n\nA more aggressive front fascia was added thanks to a Nissan Skyline inspired front bumper for 2002 models. Black housing headlights, fog-lights, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a dual-tip muffler, and 16\" aluminum-alloy wheels were also standard. This trim also featured a sport-tuned suspension, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and beige sport seat cloth.\n\n===Sentra SE-R Spec V===\nThe Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V was the more performance oriented [[sport compact]] version of the Nissan Sentra. Its engine (also shared with the SE-R) was the same 2.5-liter [[Nissan QR engine|QR25DE]] unit originally created for the Nissan Altima and Frontier pickups. This engine produced {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000&nbsp;rpm. It was mated to a six-speed RS6F51H manual transmission and a helical [[limited slip differential]]; which served as the only transmission of choice for the Spec V.\n\nThe car's handling was aided with more aggressive tuning of the car's suspension (in comparison to lower trim models) and the addition of low-profile 17-inch wheels. A front [[strut bar|strut tower brace]], firmer springs, revised shock damping, firmer front polyurethane bushings, dual-tip muffler, and front stabilizer bars were all standard. A four-wheel anti-lock braking system (which was packaged with front-seat side-impact air bags) was also optional equipment on all 2002-2006 models. Specific to the 2004-2006 model years; potential buyers could also purchase a 4 piston Brembo brake caliper upgrade.\n\nThis model also came with a standard race-inspired sporty interior, such as Nissan Skyline inspired seats and a thick leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other optional features at the time included a [[Rockford Fosgate]] 300-watt nine-speaker audio system (with an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} subwoofer in the trunk), six-disc autochanger, and a power sunroof. Other equipment include sportier-looking headlights with black surrounding the silver reflectors, standard fog-lights, lower-body sill extensions and a rear spoiler.\n\nInitially, for 2002 and 2003, the SE-R Spec V (along with the SE-R) was given an aggressive front fascia (styled after the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R]]) with side still extensions and rear trunk-mounted spoiler. Originally, speculation arose surrounding the Spec V designation being a play on the GT-R V-Spec Skyline name. This speculation has been proven to be true with the introduction of the R35 GT-R Spec V in North America. The Spec V designation is due to the fact that for some unknown legal reason Nissan cannot use the V-Spec title in the US market.\n\n===Sentra 2.5 LE and 2.5S===\nThe QR25DE was not only sported in the SE-R and SE-R Spec V trims of the B15 Sentra, but also came in the 2003 Sentra 2.5LE and 2004 Sentra 2.5S. These versions did not sport any exterior resemblance to the SE-R trims; they clone the exterior and interior of the lower trims (GXE, 1.8S), to include clear [[head lamp]]s, beige-colored interior cloth, and softer suspension than the SE-R's. The only available transmission was a 4-speed automatic. These trims offered the appearance of a standard Sentra coupled with the power of an SE-R.\n\n===2004 model year update===\n[[File:Nissan Sentra -- 09-08-2009.jpg|thumb|left|2004\u20132006 Nissan Sentra]]\n[[File:2005 Nissan Sentra 1.8L Special Edition, rear 4.16.18.jpg|thumb|right|2005-2006 Special Edition (rear)]]\n\nIn 2003, the 2004 model year saw a minor facelift for all Sentras. Gearing was changed in 2003\u20132006 SE-R Spec V for quicker quarter-mile times of 15.2. SE-R's came only in automatic transmission from 2003 to 2006 and are capable of a quarter-mile time of 16.0. The SE-R (Spec-V included) retained the different headlights and gained \"smoked-out\" tail lights.\n\n====Special Edition====\nThe Special Edition of the Sentra 1.8L was produced for model years 2005 and 2006. Exterior features included a rear spoiler, fog lights, SE-R-style front grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels borrowed from the SE-R model. Interior features included 320-watt six-disc [[Rockford Fosgate]] nine-speaker sound system, and a charcoal cloth interior and leather-wrapped wheel borrowed from the SE-R model. The only available engine was the ''QG18DE'' paired with either a four-speed automatic or very limited five-speed manuals.\n\n====SE-R/SE-R Spec V====\n[[File:04-06 Nissan Sentra SE-R.jpg|thumb|left|2004\u20132006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V]]\n\nFor the 2004\u20132006 model years, no significant cosmetic changes were added to differentiate the SE-R model, although it still retained its side-skirt extensions, rear spoiler, black housing headlights and newly designed wheels. The 2004 model year also featured a new style of tail-light which is reminiscent of the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R's]] quadruple taillights. Volcanic Orange, an exclusive color for the SE-R and Spec V trim was available for 2004\u20132006 models.\n\nThe interior was also redesigned accordingly. Starting in 2005, the \"SE-R\" badged \"goose-neck\" shifter handle from the previous models was replaced by an all black, leather stitched ball-top shifter. The original two-tone interior cloth found in Spec V models, which was originally red and black for 2002, later changed to gray and black for 2003\u20132004, was changed to all-black mesh for the final two years of production.\n\nA brake package featuring Brembo four-piston calipers up front, 12\" vented front discs and 10.9\" rear discs was available for 2004\u20132006 Spec V models. ABS was unavailable with this package.\n\nNismo offered a S-Tune and R-Tune upgrade starting in 2004, which could be dealer installed or modified by the owner. The S-Tune package came with a Nismo stainless cat-back exhaust, Nismo springs and shocks, Nismo brake pads, Nismo 23mm front anti-roll bar, and lighter Nismo 17\" wheels. The R-Tune package included all of the former, along with a Nismo header, Nismo cold-air intake, rear Nismo 25mm anti-roll bar, Nismo cams, Nismo [[lower tie bar]], and a Nismo hard bushing kit.

The B17 Sentra was finally updated with the V motion front fascia in November 2017 for the 2018 model year, but the facelift was a version exclusive to the Taiwanese market conducted by [[Yulon Motors]], the manufacturer of Nissan products in Taiwan. The facelift preserves the pre-facelift front fenders and hood with only the headlights and front bumper redesigned to save cost.

The Sentra name continued to be used in New Zealand for the Pulsar until 1998, just as [[Nissan Almera|Almera]] was used in Europe. After 2002, the Pulsar name was adopted.\n\nUnlike the North American version, a hatchback was offered; engines offered were 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 2.0 L petrol engines; a diesel was available in Europe.

The [[Taiwan]]ese-market Sentra reflects the styling of the Japanese-market Bluebird Sylphy (also as the Almera/Pulsar sedan but with a luxury emphasis). This N16 model is called Sentra M1. The Nissan Sentra nameplate returned in October 2013 as B17, marketed as Nissan Super Sentra.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the first and second generations Sentra were the Sunny-based B12 and B13 models respectively. The 1988\u20131990 B12 was offered as SGX Sedan and SR Coupe. The B13 was nicknamed '''Sentra Genesis''', only sold as sedan from 1991 to 1996. After skipping six years, Nissan re-introduced the Sentra in Indonesia in 2002. The Sentra was now based on the N16 Pulsar or [[Nissan Bluebird Sylphy]]. It is powered by a 1.8-liter QG18 engine matched to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sentra was only offered in luxury ''Super Saloon'' trim level, loaded with standard ABS and leather interior. However, it was sold only in small numbers until 2004.\n\nThe [[Philippines]] also used the Sentra name for its version of the Pulsar. The N16 model was known as the '''Nissan Sentra Exalta''' (available from 2001 to 2003). The early model is similar to the JDM Bluebird Sylphy. Nissan Philippines introduced a model with new headlights and tail lights, that was later renamed back to Sentra. This model was known as the '''Sunny Neo''' in Thailand. These N16 Sentras have QG series powerplants and are sold in three variants namely the 1.3L GX (QG13DE), GSX (QG16DE) and the top of the line GS (QG16DE). Starting the third quarter of 2010, the Nissan Sentra B16 became available in the Philippines included in the new line-up of automobiles from Nissan Motor Philippines (NMPI). It is called the new Nissan Sentra 200 with an MR20 engine available in two variants: 6-speed manual and Xtronic CVT transmission.\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/cars/sentra.html Official site]\n\n{{nissan}}\n{{Modern North American Nissan vehicles}}\n{{Modern European Nissan vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Nissan vehicles|Sentra]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]<!-- [[Category:1980s cars]] is not needed because already included in [[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]].

Originally [[subcompact car|subcompact]] in classification, for [[model year]] 2000 it was reclassified as a [[compact car]]. Until 2006, Sentra was a rebadged export version of the Japanese [[Nissan Sunny]], but since the 2013 model year, Sentra is a rebadged export version of the [[Nissan Sylphy#B17|Nissan Sylphy B17]]. The Sentra nameplate is not used in Japan. Many other countries in South America sell their versions of the Sunny as the Sentra. In Mexico, the first three generations of the Sentra were known as the '''Nissan Tsuru''' (Japanese for [[red-crowned crane|crane]]), and the B13 model was sold under that name until 2017, alongside the updated models badged as Sentra.\n\nIn North America, the Sentra currently serves as Nissan's compact car, despite being rated as a [[mid-size car]] by the [[EPA]] due to its interior volume since the 2007 model year. While previous Sentras were subcompacts, the Sentra has grown over the years, with the [[Nissan Versa]] having replaced the Sentra in the entry-level area.\n\nThe Sentra name was created for Nissan by Ira Bachrach of Namelab, and Bachrach describes the origin as \"Nissan wanted consumers to understand that it was quite safe even though it was small.

The B12 chassis was first produced and marketed in 1985 in most parts of the world; however, it was not offered to the United States until 1986. For the 1987 model, all Sentras came standard with the [[Nissan E engine|E16]] engine with {{convert|69|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (excepting the Sport Coup\u00e9 and four-wheel-drive wagon, which came with throttle-body-injected E16i engines) and a five-speed [[manual transmission]]. In 1988, all Sentras had the {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} E16i, which was offered for this year with throttle body injection (TBI). In many parts of the world the E-series soldiered on in the B12 chassis with some getting the multi-point [[fuel injection]] E16E engine. Diesel engines were also offered in some models, but were rare and only available in North American 1987 models and in certain other parts of the world. From 1989 to 1990, the only engine choice was the {{convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Nissan GA engine|GA16i]], a 12-valve SOHC predecessor of the [[GA16DE]]. Transaxles offered were the 4- and 5-speed manuals (RN4F31A and RS5F31A, respectively) and a 3-speed automatic with torque converter lockup (RL3F01A).\n\nThe B12 carried over a radically modified 4-wheel independent suspension from the B11, with 4-wheel disc brakes an option in some parts of the world. This was the start of the model classes which were standard through the 2003 model year (not all classes were available every year) having the '''E''' as the base-level economy car, the '''XE''' as the next-up model, the '''GXE''' as the top level for the 4-door sedan, the sporty '''SE''' coupe, and the '''SE-R''' (Not available in the US market) as the top of the line performance model. The GXE (available from 1987 to 2003) had a body colored bumper, aero side mirrors with manual remote control, tachometer as well as standard 13\" 175/70R13 alloy wheels along with air-conditioning, variable intermittent wipers, but no standard cassette deck nor any power windows/locks/mirrors. The SE also had dual [[mirror]]s, air conditioning, tachometer, and power door locks and [[window]]s in some markets and possibly electronic fuel injection.\n\nThe B12 chassis would be the last chassis to offer a station wagon model, which was marketed as the \"California\" in some Asian markets. Even more rare are the [[four-wheel drive]] versions of the station wagon, offered as an option in 1987, 1988 and 1989 model years. These models featured an electrically activated single-range transfer case to drive the independently suspended rear wheels, making the car a selectable four-wheel-drive (not all-wheel-drive) vehicle.\n\n1989 saw a subtle change in the body style of the Sentra sedan, as new larger, more rounded front corner lights were introduced to the front fenders and redesigned taillights were added to the rear fascia (station wagon retained same rear lights). The Nissan logo on the front grille was relocated from the right hand side to the center. In 1990, electrically retracted front shoulder belts were added, as well as 3-point harnesses for the rear passengers, excluding the center rear passenger.\n\nThe Sport Coupe was a sportier style of the Sentra. It shared none of the body components with the standard model. It was only available with the E16i or GA16i. All Sport Coupes had dual sway bars, dual remote-adjust mirrors, and a tachometer instrument cluster. The SE model added features like air conditioning and rear speakers. All B12 Sentras used the same wiring harness, regardless of options installed on any particular vehicle.\n\nB12s are known for reliability and excellent fuel economy, and are considered by enthusiasts to be good low budget project cars due to interchangeability of parts between generations and with other Nissan models.\n\nIn Canada, the B12 four-door sedan remained available through the 1993 model year. Essentially a rebadged Nissan Tsuru II built in Mexico, it was called ''Sentra Classic'' to distinguish it from the B13 model released for 1991. It replaced the [[Nissan Micra]] 3/5-door [[hatchback]]s which were discontinued that time as a price-leader model. All 1991\u201393 \"Classic\" models came with the {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} E16i and the choice of two transmissions, a 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]].\n\n===Latin America===\nIn Mexico, it was named the Nissan Tsuru II, available in 2, 4 door sedans and wagon, while the Coup\u00e9 was named the Nissan Hikari. They were produced and marketed locally between 1988 and 1991. For 1988 for the 4 door Tsuru II and the Hikari had available the Turbo EGI (fuel injected) 1.6 L engine in a very rare, sporty version. It was one of the most reliable cars in its time in Mexico, being a great sales success. This generation was also exported to some Central and South American markets such as Peru, Chile and Bolivia. In Chile the Mexican-made car received \"Sentra\" badging and was available from October 1987 until 1993.<ref name=VeoB12>{{cite web | url = http://www.veoautos.cl/nissan-sentra-nacido-como-sunny-b12-ingreso-a-chile-el-ano-1987/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190804210558/http://www.veoautos.cl/nissan-sentra-nacido-como-sunny-b12-ingreso-a-chile-el-ano-1987/ | archivedate = 2019-08-04 | title = Nissan Sentra: Nacido como Sunny B12 ingres\u00f3 a Chile el a\u00f1o 1987 | trans-title = Nissan Sentra: Born as the Sunny B12 it entered Chile in 1987 | work = VeoAutos.cl | language = es | date = 2018-11-21 }}</ref> The Sentra was the most sold car in the country in 1991 and 1992.<ref name=VeoB12/>\n\nIn the Philippines, it was initially offered in three trims namely the 1.7 DX (diesel), 1.3 SLX and the 1.5 SGX, the wagon version was also available in the 1.5 SGX trim and was called the Nissan California. In mid 1989, the Sentra model line was freshened up and the engines were upgraded to 1.4- (LX) and 1.6-liter. The 1.6 SGX gained power steering, windows, door locks and side mirrors, a first in its class. The second-generation B12 also had a diesel variant which had the 1.7 CD17 engine. The second wagon version (known as Nissan California 1.6 SGX) also had all power features.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:86-88 Nissan Sentra coupe.jpg|1987\u20131988 Nissan Sentra 2-door (US)\nFile:1988 Nissan Sentra Coupe front 3.2.18.jpg|1987\u20131988 Nissan Sentra Sport Coup\u00e9 (US)\nFile:Nissan_Sentra_XE_3-door.jpg|Nissan Sentra XE 3-door (US)\nFile:Nissan Sentra wagon rear.jpg|1989\u20131990 Nissan Sentra wagon (US)\nFile:'89-'90 Nissan Sentra Hatchback.jpg|1989\u20131990 Nissan Sentra Sport Coup\u00e9 (North America)\nFile:Nissan Sentra B12 Sedan.jpg|1989\u20131990 Nissan Sentra sedan (North America)\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|B13}}B13 (1990)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|platform=[[Nissan B platform]]\n|name=Third generation\n|image=Nissan Sentra E sedan.jpg\n|production=August 1990 \u2013 October 1994<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-11-19/business/9004050776_1_sentra-se-r-cavalier-vl-31-liter-v-6 |title=Stylish Nissan Sentra Sings The Lead in High-mileage Subcompact |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><br />1992\u2014May 2017 (Mexico)<ref name=\"tsuru2017\">http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-announces-end-of-production-date-for-the-tsuru-in-mexico</ref>\n|aka=Nissan Sunny (B13)<br />Nissan Tsuru (Mexico)<br />Nissan V16 (Chile)<br />Nissan Sentra (B13) (South America) <br />Nissan Genesis (Indonesia)<ref name=im91>{{cite magazine | magazine = Intan Motor | title = Harga mobil baru | trans-title = New car prices | date = October 2, 1991 | issn = 0215-7713 | number = 91 | publisher = Yayasan Beraya Press | location = Jakarta | language = id | editor-last = Mustmar | editor-first = Andi | page = 49 }}</ref>\n|related = [[Nissan Sunny]]<br />[[Nissan Presea]]<br />[[Nissan NX]]\n|engine={{ubl | 1295&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan GA engine#GA13|GA13DS]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (Philippines) | 1392&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan GA engine#GA14|GA14DS/DE]]'' I4 | 1597&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan E engine#E16|E16]]'' I4 | 1597&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan GA engine#GA16DE|GA16DE]]'' I4 | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE|SR20DE]]'' I4 }}\n|layout=[[FF layout]]\n|transmission={{ubl |4/5-speed manual|3-speed RL3F01A automatic (1.6L)|4-speed RL4F03A automatic (1.4L, 1.6L<ref name=\"1994fsm\">{{cite magazine|title=Nissan Sentra B13 1994 FSM}}</ref>)|4-speed RL4F03V automatic (2.0L)(1991-1993<ref name=\"1993fsm\">{{cite magazine|title=Nissan Sentra B13 1993 FSM}}</ref>)|4-speed RE4F03V automatic (2.0L)(1994<ref name=\"1994fsm\"></ref>)}}\n|wheelbase= {{convert|95.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Tsuru: {{convert|2430|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|assembly=[[Smyrna, Tennessee]]<br>[[Cuernavaca]], [[Morelos]], [[M\u00e9xico]]<br> [[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]], [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]], Japan <br>[[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]<br>[[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]\n|length= {{convert|170.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Tsuru: {{convert|4325|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|width= {{convert|65.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1993\u201394)<br />{{convert|65.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1991\u201392)<br />{{convert|53.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe & 1991\u201392 sedan)<br />{{convert|54.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1993\u201394 sedan)<br />Tsuru: {{convert|1650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n|height= {{convert|53.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Tsuru: {{convert|1381|mm|in||abbr=on}}\n|weight=2 door: {{convert|2266|lb|abbr=on}}<br />4 door: {{convert|2288|lb|abbr=on}}\n|body_style=2/4-door sedan\n}}\n\nThe sedan came standard with the fuel-injected 110-{{convert|126|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|108|lbft|Nm|0}} 1.6-liter 16-valve [[4-cylinder]] [[Nissan GA engine#GA16DE|GA16DE]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]].

Four-door models came with front motorized shoulder seatbelts. The short-lived three-door [[hatchback]] of the B12 Sentra was not replaced in this generation, and the sporting coup\u00e9 version was replaced by the ovoid [[Nissan NX]].\n\nFor the 1992 model year (August 1991 \u2013 July 1992 production), a passenger's side vanity mirror and black body-side moldings became standard on the Sentra 2-door. The Value Option Package (air conditioning, cruise control, and a stereo system) was extended to SE models. The optional three-speed automatic in the E coupe was dropped and gained an optional 4-speed automatic, shared with other models.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/nissan/sentra/1992/ |title=1992 Nissan Sentra |work=Edmunds}}</ref>\n\n===Facelift===\nFrom August 1992 production, the B13 received a facelift for the 1993 model year. All Sentras received interior updates, new front and rear fascias. A driver's airbag was also made standard on the GXE and optional on the rest of the range for 1993. An XE Limited model was added for both the coupe and sedan.\n\nFor 1994 models (August 1993 production), a CFC-free refrigerant became standard on models equipped with air conditioning. XE models got more standard equipment that included air conditioning, cruise control and a stereo cassette player. The XE Limited was dropped for 1994. In May 1994, a 1994.5 \"Limited\" model was released as a placeholder for a delayed replacement, due in early 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/nissan/sentra/1993/ |title=1993 Nissan Sentra |work=Edmunds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/nissan/sentra/1994/ |title=1994 Nissan Sentra |work=Edmunds}}</ref>\n\n===Sentra SE-R===\n[[File:Nissan Sentra SE-R coupe.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Sentra SE-R]]\n\nThe B13 was the first to offer Nissan's famous and then-new ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE|SR20DE]]'' engine in the sporty two-door SE-R model. Setting [[subcompact]] speed records of the time, the Sentra SE-R came with {{convert|140|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 6400&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|132|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4800&nbsp;rpm. It could accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} in 7.6 seconds and the quarter-mile in 15.8 seconds. It came with 4-wheel [[disc brake]]s and had a [[MacPherson strut]] [[independent suspension]]. Further improving the handling was a viscous limited-slip differential, which was standard equipment on the SE-R.

The Super Saloon had all power features. The SE-Saloon came as a Limited edition equipped with four-wheel disc brakes and ABS. Both SE and Super Saloon come standard with the GA16DE.\n\nThe B13 SuperSaloon and SE Saloon came with the GA16DE fuel-injected engine (top of the line engine for the Philippine market) which is comparable to the U.S Spec B13 SE Limited with loaded options. These models are not equipped with emissions equipment \u2013 catalytic converters and sensors as well as EGR. B13's where sold new from 1990 to 1999. The LEC version comes with the standard GA13 carburated engine as well as the LEC Ps (Power Steering model). The JX comes with the GA14 carburated engine.\n\n===Nissan Tsuru/V16/Sentra (1992\u20132017) {{anchor|tsuru}}===\nThe Mexican-built Sentra B13 was sold in Mexico for 25 years as well as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Central America and South America. It is known as the '''Nissan Tsuru''' in Mexico, '''Nissan V16''' in Chile, '''Sentra B13''' in Central and South America countries. and '''Sentra Cl\u00e1sico''' in Peru and the Dominican Republic. Tsuru vehicles destined for the Mexican market were modified by Nissan Mexicana specifically for the Mexican market and for the most part are identical to the 1991 model except for a new Renault clutch/transmission, updated Mexican made electronic systems and minor cosmetic and ergonomic upgrades.\n\nThe Tsuru was the most popular car in Mexico from 1997 until 2011 when it was surpassed by the Mexican made Volkswagen Jetta. The Middle East/African export market version is the same basic car only with minor cosmetic changes and mechanical downgrades to make it cheaper, such as non-power steering, downgraded interior trim, a downgraded braking system, and a mechanical clutch instead of a hydraulic one.\n\nVehicles sold in the Middle East region are not equipped with [[catalytic converter]]s to make the car cheaper to build.<ref>http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2013/2/19/Cars-That-Won-t-Die-Nissan-Tsuru-7713035/</ref> Because of the lack of the catalytic converter the vehicles are illegal in Mexico and South America. More recent models have received a [[Renault]]-built hydraulic clutch and an optional catalytic converter. Its affordable price, relatively good fuel economy, easy to fix and find spare parts make it popular among local taxi drivers and low income families in Mexico, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Tsuru is commonly used for the [[taxicab livery]] in Mexico as a replacement for the VW Beetle \u2013 much like its predecessor, Tsurus have been sighted in the Southwest United States since Mexican nationals can operate them in the USA as long as it has the valid registration documents (they are illegal for sale and/or export into the USA since it does not meet the DOT's safety requirements e.g. airbags and electronic stability control and are [[Grey import vehicle#United States|less than 25 years old]]). Due to the passing of stricter automobile safety regulations in Mexico, production of the Tsuru was discontinued in May 2017, as the Tsuru lacked both anti-lock brakes and airbags.<ref name=\"Woodard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/news/a30437/nissan-b13-sentra-cancelled/|title=The 1991 Nissan Sentra Is Finally Going Out of Production|last=Woodard|first=Collin|date=August 17, 2016|work=[[Road & Track]]|publisher=[[Hearst (media)|Hearst Digital Media]]|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> A special commemorative edition limited to 1000 cars went on sale in March 2017.<ref name=\"tsuru2017\" />\n\n{{gallery | width = 185 | height = 118\n|File:Nissan Tsuru B13.jpg|Pre-facelift B13 Nissan Tsuru\n|File:'03-'04 Nissan Tsuru.jpg|2002\u20132004 Nissan Tsuru\n|File:Nissan Tsuru B-13.jpg|2005\u20132017 Nissan Tsuru\n|File:Nissan_Tsuru_Taxi.jpg|Nissan Tsuru taxi in [[Cancun]]\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|B14}}B14 (1995)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|platform=[[Nissan B platform]]\n|name=Fourth generation\n|image=1995-1997 Nissan Sentra -- 03-21-2012.JPG\n|production={{ubl\n  | November 1994 \u2013 December 1999\n  | 1995 - 2002 (Philippines)\n  }}\n|engine=1.6 L ''[[Nissan GA engine#GA16DE|GA16DE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE|SR20DE]]'' I4\n|wheelbase= {{convert|99.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=1995\u201396: {{convert|170.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1997\u201399: {{convert|171.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|aka=[[Nissan Sunny#B14|Nissan Sunny (B14)]]<br />[[Nissan Lucino]]/200SX<br />[[Nissan Presea]]\n|layout=[[FF layout]]\n|width= {{convert|66.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|assembly=[[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]], [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]], Japan<br>[[Smyrna, Tennessee]]<br />[[Aguascalientes]], Mexico<br />[[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]<br />[[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://car-cat.com/firm-797.html |title=Nissan.

This generation is also the first generation in Mexico wearing the '''Sentra''' name. It is also the first Sentra generation exclusively sold in sedan form, as the coupe was dropped in favour of the [[Nissan 200SX]] reintroduction. The revived 200SX also replaced the related [[Nissan NX]].\n\nAll engines in the B14 line up came with timing chains, designed to last the vehicle's lifetime.\n\nThe B14 sentra platform was offered several trims, Base, XE, GXE, GLE, SE and SE Limited. Base and XE come with 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, GXE prior to 1998 also included 13-inch wheels. The only difference between trims is the GXE and up come with rear seat trunk access, rear headrests, a grip-assist handle on the passenger side, additional fabric on doors and seats as opposed to vinyl, power windows, locks, mirrors, etc. The GLE, SE, and Special Edition include in some instances leather, rear spoiler and moonroof, and keyless entry packages. All trims except the SE and SE-R have the [[GA16DE]] 1.6&nbsp;L engine producing {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|108|lbft|Nm|0}}.

When new, this redesign was considered a substantial upgrade, compared to the \"cheap\" economy car it replaced. Previously, the compact class had been occupied by the [[Nissan Altima|Altima]], which moved to the [[mid-size]] class in 2001, and its wheelbase remained unchanged from the previous generation. While earlier Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series [[Nissan Sunny]] twins, the B15 Sentra diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny (Nissan Super Sunny). Production shifted from [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] to [[Aguascalientes]], Mexico, and the Smyrna production line was retooled to build the [[Nissan Xterra]]. The 2000\u20132001 Sentra SE with the SR20DE [[Roller rocker]] motor, which has {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|136|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, occupied the top of the line Sentra until the SE-R returned for model year 2002.

In Brazil, this engine generated {{convert|113|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|114|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm.<ref>[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/testes/conteudo_143179.shtml \"Testes: Nissan Sentra GXE\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821070357/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/testes/conteudo_143179.shtml |date=August 21, 2011 }}, ''Quatro Rodas'', October 2004.

The exterior was also substantially updated and now featured [[body-side molding]]s and clear [[headlight]]s. The curb weight on the QG18DE-engined Sentra is {{convert|2513|lb|abbr=on}}. With the introduction of the B15 in year 2000, Nissan also introduced a CA 'Clean Air' trim only available in California. The CA trim boasts a double walled exhaust, 3 catalytic converters, quick catalyst warm up, and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone (smog) into oxygen. The Sentra CA model is the only gasoline-fueled vehicle in the world to receive California Air Resources Board (CARB) super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) certification and obtain zero-emission credits.<ref>[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/20000111/press005749.html \"2000 Nissan Sentra CA Claims Title As the Cleanest Gasoline-Fueled Car\"], ''The Auto Channel'', January 2000. Retrieved May 27, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn markets where the B15 Sentra or Sunny was not sold, Nissan usually sold a similar car called the [[Nissan Sylphy#G10|Nissan Bluebird Sylphy (G10/N16)]] in Japan but under other names elsewhere. In Europe, the Bluebird Sylphy was known as the [[Nissan Almera#N16|Nissan Almera (N16)]] and Australia and New Zealand as the [[Nissan Pulsar#N16|Nissan Pulsar (N16)]]. The G10/N16 is constructed on the same platform as the B15 and features the same interior and engines.\n\n===Sentra SE-R===\n[[File:2002-2003 Nissan Sentra SE-R.jpg|thumb|left|2002\u20132003 Nissan Sentra SE-R]]\n\nIn 2001 for the 2002 model year, a new SE-R was introduced powered by the 2.5-liter ''[[Nissan QR engine|QR25DE]]'' {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|lbft|Nm|0}} [[4-cylinder]]. The SE-R came with a 5-speed RS5F51A manual transmission or optional 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. The 5-speed manual was dropped in 2003 models, which consequently made the only available transmission a 4-speed automatic.\n\nA more aggressive front fascia was added thanks to a Nissan Skyline inspired front bumper for 2002 models. Black housing headlights, fog-lights, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a dual-tip muffler, and 16\" aluminum-alloy wheels were also standard. This trim also featured a sport-tuned suspension, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and beige sport seat cloth.\n\n===Sentra SE-R Spec V===\nThe Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V was the more performance oriented [[sport compact]] version of the Nissan Sentra. Its engine (also shared with the SE-R) was the same 2.5-liter [[Nissan QR engine|QR25DE]] unit originally created for the Nissan Altima and Frontier pickups. This engine produced {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000&nbsp;rpm. It was mated to a six-speed RS6F51H manual transmission and a helical [[limited slip differential]]; which served as the only transmission of choice for the Spec V.\n\nThe car's handling was aided with more aggressive tuning of the car's suspension (in comparison to lower trim models) and the addition of low-profile 17-inch wheels. A front [[strut bar|strut tower brace]], firmer springs, revised shock damping, firmer front polyurethane bushings, dual-tip muffler, and front stabilizer bars were all standard. A four-wheel anti-lock braking system (which was packaged with front-seat side-impact air bags) was also optional equipment on all 2002-2006 models. Specific to the 2004-2006 model years; potential buyers could also purchase a 4 piston Brembo brake caliper upgrade.\n\nThis model also came with a standard race-inspired sporty interior, such as Nissan Skyline inspired seats and a thick leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other optional features at the time included a [[Rockford Fosgate]] 300-watt nine-speaker audio system (with an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} subwoofer in the trunk), six-disc autochanger, and a power sunroof. Other equipment include sportier-looking headlights with black surrounding the silver reflectors, standard fog-lights, lower-body sill extensions and a rear spoiler.\n\nInitially, for 2002 and 2003, the SE-R Spec V (along with the SE-R) was given an aggressive front fascia (styled after the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R]]) with side still extensions and rear trunk-mounted spoiler. Originally, speculation arose surrounding the Spec V designation being a play on the GT-R V-Spec Skyline name. This speculation has been proven to be true with the introduction of the R35 GT-R Spec V in North America. The Spec V designation is due to the fact that for some unknown legal reason Nissan cannot use the V-Spec title in the US market.\n\n===Sentra 2.5 LE and 2.5S===\nThe QR25DE was not only sported in the SE-R and SE-R Spec V trims of the B15 Sentra, but also came in the 2003 Sentra 2.5LE and 2004 Sentra 2.5S. These versions did not sport any exterior resemblance to the SE-R trims; they clone the exterior and interior of the lower trims (GXE, 1.8S), to include clear [[head lamp]]s, beige-colored interior cloth, and softer suspension than the SE-R's. The only available transmission was a 4-speed automatic. These trims offered the appearance of a standard Sentra coupled with the power of an SE-R.\n\n===2004 model year update===\n[[File:Nissan Sentra -- 09-08-2009.jpg|thumb|left|2004\u20132006 Nissan Sentra]]\n[[File:2005 Nissan Sentra 1.8L Special Edition, rear 4.16.18.jpg|thumb|right|2005-2006 Special Edition (rear)]]\n\nIn 2003, the 2004 model year saw a minor facelift for all Sentras. Gearing was changed in 2003\u20132006 SE-R Spec V for quicker quarter-mile times of 15.2. SE-R's came only in automatic transmission from 2003 to 2006 and are capable of a quarter-mile time of 16.0. The SE-R (Spec-V included) retained the different headlights and gained \"smoked-out\" tail lights.\n\n====Special Edition====\nThe Special Edition of the Sentra 1.8L was produced for model years 2005 and 2006. Exterior features included a rear spoiler, fog lights, SE-R-style front grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels borrowed from the SE-R model. Interior features included 320-watt six-disc [[Rockford Fosgate]] nine-speaker sound system, and a charcoal cloth interior and leather-wrapped wheel borrowed from the SE-R model. The only available engine was the ''QG18DE'' paired with either a four-speed automatic or very limited five-speed manuals.\n\n====SE-R/SE-R Spec V====\n[[File:04-06 Nissan Sentra SE-R.jpg|thumb|left|2004\u20132006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V]]\n\nFor the 2004\u20132006 model years, no significant cosmetic changes were added to differentiate the SE-R model, although it still retained its side-skirt extensions, rear spoiler, black housing headlights and newly designed wheels. The 2004 model year also featured a new style of tail-light which is reminiscent of the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R's]] quadruple taillights. Volcanic Orange, an exclusive color for the SE-R and Spec V trim was available for 2004\u20132006 models.\n\nThe interior was also redesigned accordingly. Starting in 2005, the \"SE-R\" badged \"goose-neck\" shifter handle from the previous models was replaced by an all black, leather stitched ball-top shifter. The original two-tone interior cloth found in Spec V models, which was originally red and black for 2002, later changed to gray and black for 2003\u20132004, was changed to all-black mesh for the final two years of production.\n\nA brake package featuring Brembo four-piston calipers up front, 12\" vented front discs and 10.9\" rear discs was available for 2004\u20132006 Spec V models. ABS was unavailable with this package.\n\nNismo offered a S-Tune and R-Tune upgrade starting in 2004, which could be dealer installed or modified by the owner. The S-Tune package came with a Nismo stainless cat-back exhaust, Nismo springs and shocks, Nismo brake pads, Nismo 23mm front anti-roll bar, and lighter Nismo 17\" wheels. The R-Tune package included all of the former, along with a Nismo header, Nismo cold-air intake, rear Nismo 25mm anti-roll bar, Nismo cams, Nismo [[lower tie bar]], and a Nismo hard bushing kit. Nismo cosmetic upgrades were also available, which included a Nismo rear spoiler, and a front and rear Nismo under spoiler/lip.\n\n===Transmissions===\nThe 2000\u20132006 2.0&nbsp;L (SR20DE) and 1.8L (QG18DE) automatics use the 4 speed RE4F03B transmission. The 2.5-litre (QR25DE)  2.5S and SE-R automatics use the 4 speed RE4F04B transmission. The 2002\u20132006 SE-R Spec Vs used the 6 speed P12 RS6H51 6 speed tranmssion with limited slip.\n\nThe SE-R Spec V QR25's horsepower were rated at {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.nissannews.com/assets/specs/2004_sentra_specs.pdf \"2004 Sentra Receives Facelift and Interior Enhancements, Maintains Popularity in the Small Car Segment\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809065821/http://www.nissannews.com/assets/specs/2004_sentra_specs.pdf |date=August 9, 2011 }}, 2004.

Among these new parts are the intake and exhaust valves and seals made with new materials, the first [[piston]] ring made with [[Anodizing|anodized]] steel, more resistant [[connecting rods]], [[Fuel injection|fuel injectors]] suitable for use in ethanol and double-layer [[Oxygen sensor|exhaust gas oxygen]] to increase the moisture resistance of the fuel. The power rose to 141&nbsp;hp (143 cv) both in gasoline and ethanol. Compression ratio of 9.7:1 was kept unchanged.<ref name=\"mecon\" />\n\nAt the time it was launched, there was some controversy regarding the possibility of vehicles equipped with CVT transmission be converted to flex fuel, since this was the statement that was made by [[Honda|Honda Motor of Brazil]] in the launch of the second generation [[Honda Fit]] in Brazil. During the 2008 upgrade of the Honda Fit, the CVT system was replaced by a conventional automatic transmission and according to the manufacturer it was not possible to attach the CVT transmission infinite relations to a flex fuel engine. Honda's decision to change the type of transmission reduced manufacturing costs and Brazilian auto press inquired the truth of that statement following the release of the CVT-equipped Sentra FFV.<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Carros/0,,MUL1255633-9658,00-SENTRA+COM+MOTOR+FLEX+CHEGA+AS+LOJAS.html \"Sentra com motor flex chega \u00e0s lojas\"], ''G1'', August 5, 2009.

The Sentra name continued to be used in New Zealand for the Pulsar until 1998, just as [[Nissan Almera|Almera]] was used in Europe. After 2002, the Pulsar name was adopted.\n\nUnlike the North American version, a hatchback was offered; engines offered were 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 2.0 L petrol engines; a diesel was available in Europe.

The [[Taiwan]]ese-market Sentra reflects the styling of the Japanese-market Bluebird Sylphy (also as the Almera/Pulsar sedan but with a luxury emphasis). This N16 model is called Sentra M1. The Nissan Sentra nameplate returned in October 2013 as B17, marketed as Nissan Super Sentra.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the first and second generations Sentra were the Sunny-based B12 and B13 models respectively. The 1988\u20131990 B12 was offered as SGX Sedan and SR Coupe. The B13 was nicknamed '''Sentra Genesis''', only sold as sedan from 1991 to 1996. After skipping six years, Nissan re-introduced the Sentra in Indonesia in 2002. The Sentra was now based on the N16 Pulsar or [[Nissan Bluebird Sylphy]]. It is powered by a 1.8-liter QG18 engine matched to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sentra was only offered in luxury ''Super Saloon'' trim level, loaded with standard ABS and leather interior. However, it was sold only in small numbers until 2004.\n\nThe [[Philippines]] also used the Sentra name for its version of the Pulsar. The N16 model was known as the '''Nissan Sentra Exalta''' (available from 2001 to 2003). The early model is similar to the JDM Bluebird Sylphy. Nissan Philippines introduced a model with new headlights and tail lights, that was later renamed back to Sentra. This model was known as the '''Sunny Neo''' in Thailand. These N16 Sentras have QG series powerplants and are sold in three variants namely the 1.3L GX (QG13DE), GSX (QG16DE) and the top of the line GS (QG16DE). Starting the third quarter of 2010, the Nissan Sentra B16 became available in the Philippines included in the new line-up of automobiles from Nissan Motor Philippines (NMPI). It is called the new Nissan Sentra 200 with an MR20 engine available in two variants: 6-speed manual and Xtronic CVT transmission.\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/cars/sentra.html Official site]\n\n{{nissan}}\n{{Modern North American Nissan vehicles}}\n{{Modern European Nissan vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Nissan vehicles|Sentra]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]<!-- [[Category:1980s cars]] is not needed because already included in [[Category:Cars introduced in 1982]].

He was a politician in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colonial Massachusetts]], a leader of the movement that became the [[American Revolution]], and one of the architects of the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]] that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President [[John Adams]].\n\nAdams was born in [[Boston]], brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of [[Harvard College]], he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and the [[Boston Town Meeting]] in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s efforts to tax the [[British America]]n colonies without their consent. His 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]] calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a [[committee of correspondence]] system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the [[British Constitution]] at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]] and the coming of the American Revolution.\n\nParliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] in 1774, at which time Adams attended the [[Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the [[Continental Association]] in 1774 and the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, and he helped draft the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[Massachusetts Constitution]]. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]] and was eventually elected governor.\n\nSamuel Adams later became a controversial figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams in the first half of the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of [[propaganda]] who provoked [[mob violence]] to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.\n\n==Early life==\nSamuel Adams was born in [[Boston]] in the British colony of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] on September 16, 1722, an [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] that is sometimes converted to the New Style date of September 27.{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=14}} Adams was one of twelve children born to [[Samuel Adams, Sr.]], and Mary (Fifield) Adams in an age of high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=4}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=22}} Adams's parents were devout [[Puritan]]s and members of the [[Old South Meeting House|Old South Congregational Church]]. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=21}} Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially [[virtue]].{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=41}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=42}}\n\nSamuel Adams, Sr. (1689\u20131748) was a prosperous merchant and church [[deacon]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=3}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}} Deacon Adams became a leading figure in Boston politics through an organization that became known as the [[Boston Caucus]], which promoted candidates who supported popular causes.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=19}} The Boston Caucus helped shape the agenda of the [[Boston Town Meeting]]. A New England [[town meeting]] is a form of [[local government]] with elected officials, and not just a gathering of citizens; according to historian [[William M. Fowler, Jr.|William Fowler]], it was \"the most democratic institution in the British empire\".{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}} Deacon Adams rose through the political ranks, becoming a justice of the peace, a [[Boston Board of Selectmen|selectman]], and a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=8}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}} He worked closely with [[Elisha Cooke, Jr.]] (1678\u20131737), the leader of the \"popular party\", a faction that resisted any encroachment by royal officials on the colonial rights embodied in the [[Massachusetts Charter]] of 1691.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}} In the coming years, members of the \"popular party\" became known as Whigs or [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A four-story brick building with many windows.|While at Harvard, Adams boarded at [[Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University|Massachusetts Hall]].{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=16}}]]\n\nThe younger Samuel Adams attended [[Boston Latin School]] and then entered [[Harvard College]] in 1736. His parents hoped that his schooling would prepare him for the ministry, but Adams gradually shifted his interest to politics.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=25}} After graduating in 1740, Adams continued his studies, earning a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] in 1743. In his thesis, he argued that it was \"lawful to resist the Supreme Magistrate, if the Commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved\", which indicated that his political views, like his father's, were oriented towards colonial rights.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=15}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=16}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=25}}\n\nAdams's life was greatly affected by his father's involvement in a banking controversy. In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a \"land bank\" which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=21}} The land bank was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]]. Opposition to the land bank came from the more aristocratic \"court party\", who were supporters of the [[list of colonial governors of Massachusetts|royal governor]] and controlled the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Governor's Council]], the upper chamber of the General Court.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=5}} The court party used its influence to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] dissolve the land bank in 1741.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=23}} Directors of the land bank, including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams's death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=10}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=12}} For Adams, these lawsuits \"served as a constant personal reminder that Britain's power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=12}}\n\n==Early career==\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1743, Adams was unsure about his future. He considered becoming a lawyer, but instead decided to go into business. He worked at Thomas Cushing's [[counting house]], but the job only lasted a few months because Cushing felt that Adams was too preoccupied with politics to become a good merchant.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=3}} Adams's father then lent him [[Massachusetts pound|\u00a3]]1,000 to go into business for himself, a substantial amount for that time.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=3}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=4}} Adams's lack of business instincts were confirmed; he lent half of this money to a friend who never repaid, and frittered away the other half. Adams always remained, in the words of historian [[Pauline Maier]], \"a man utterly uninterested in either making or possessing money\".<ref name=\"ANB\">Maier, ''American National Biography''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Old South Meetinghouse BW.jpg|thumb|175px|alt=On a city street, an old brick church with a tall steeple is surrounded by modern buildings.|The [[Old South Meeting House]] (''1968 photo shown'') was Adams's church. During the crisis with Great Britain, mass meetings were held here that were too large for [[Faneuil Hall]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=58}}]]\n\nAfter Adams had lost his money, his father made him a partner in the family's [[malthouse]], which was next to the family home on Purchase Street. Several generations of Adamses were maltsters, who produced the [[malt]] necessary for [[brewing]] beer.{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=74}} Years later, a poet poked fun at Adams by calling him \"Sam the maltster\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=24}} Adams has often been described as a brewer, but the extant evidence suggests that he worked as a maltster and not a brewer.{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=74}}{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=75}}<ref>Stoll  (''Samuel Adams'', 275n16) notes that [[James Koch]], founder of the [[Boston Beer Company]], reports having been offered for purchase a receipt for [[hops]] signed by Adams, which indicates that Adams may have done some brewing.</ref>\n\nIn January 1748, Adams and some friends were inflamed by British [[impressment]] and launched ''[[The Independent Advertiser]]'', a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=17}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=18}} His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]'', and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=21}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}} He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}} He cited the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] as an example of what could happen to [[New England]] if it were to abandon its Puritan values.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=19}}\n\nWhen Deacon Adams died in 1748, Adams was given the responsibility of managing the family's affairs.{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=30}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=31}} In October 1749, he married Elizabeth Checkley, his pastor's daughter.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=34}} Elizabeth gave birth to six children over the next seven years, but only two lived to adulthood: Samuel (born 1751) and Hannah (born 1756).{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}} In July 1757, Elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=31}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=32}} Adams remarried in 1764 to Elizabeth Wells,{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=55}} but had no other children.<ref name=\"ANB\" />\n\nLike his father, Adams embarked on a political career with the support of the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=14}} He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=14|loc=\"The failure to collect all taxes was a Boston tradition\"}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=19}} By 1765, his account was more than \u00a38,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=27}} In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of \u00a31,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=54}}\n\n==Struggle with Great Britain==\nSamuel Adams emerged as an important public figure in Boston soon after the [[British Empire]]'s victory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of [[British America]] for the first time.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=50}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}} This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.</ref>\n\n===Sugar Act===\nThe first step in the new program was the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, which Adams saw as an infringement of longstanding colonial rights. Colonists were not represented in Parliament, he argued, and therefore they could not be taxed by that body; the colonists were represented by the colonial assemblies, and only they could levy taxes upon them.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}} Adams expressed these views in May 1764, when the Boston Town Meeting elected its representatives to the Massachusetts House. As was customary, the town meeting provided the representatives with a set of written instructions, which Adams was selected to write. Adams highlighted what he perceived to be the dangers of [[taxation without representation]]:\n\n<blockquote>For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & everything we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves?{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}<ref>The complete text is in Cushing, ''Writings'', 1:1\u20137.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"When the Boston Town Meeting approved the Adams instructions on May 24, 1764,\" writes historian John K. Alexander, \"it became the first political body in America to go on record stating Parliament could not constitutionally tax the colonists. The directives also contained the first official recommendation that the colonies present a unified defense of their rights.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Adams's instructions were published in newspapers and pamphlets, and he soon became closely associated with [[James Otis, Jr.]], a member of the Massachusetts House famous for his defense of colonial rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Otis boldly challenged the constitutionality of certain acts of Parliament, but he would not go as far as Adams, who was moving towards the conclusion that Parliament did not have sovereignty over the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=22}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=53}}\n\n===Stamp Act===\nIn 1765, Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] which required colonists to pay a new tax on most printed materials.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=18}} News of the passage of the Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=50}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=51}} The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a [[Stamp Act Congress]] to coordinate colonial resistance.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=61}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}} The Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] passed a widely reprinted [[Virginia Resolves|set of resolves]] against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}} Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn Boston, a group called the [[Loyal Nine]], a precursor to the [[Sons of Liberty]], organized protests of the Stamp Act. Adams was friendly with the Loyal Nine but was not a member.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=53}} On August 14, stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]] was hanged in effigy from Boston's [[Liberty Tree]]; that night, his home was ransacked and his office demolished. On August 26, lieutenant governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson's]] home was destroyed by an angry crowd.\n\n[[File:Safhall1 copy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A statue on a pedestal of a man standing with his arms crossed.

As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=30}} James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author of a series of House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances|those passed]] by the Stamp Act Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=32}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}} Adams was one of the first colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain [[natural rights]] that governments could not violate.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}}\n\nThe Stamp Act was scheduled to go into effect on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}} Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=62}} By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=112}}\n\nThe Massachusetts popular party gained ground in the May 1766 elections. Adams was re-elected to the House and selected as its clerk, in which position he was responsible for official House papers. In the coming years, Adams used his position as clerk to great effect in promoting his political message.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=40}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=41}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=44}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=45}} Joining Adams in the House was [[John Hancock]], a new representative from Boston. Hancock was a wealthy merchant\u2014perhaps the richest man in Massachusetts\u2014but a relative newcomer to politics. He was initially a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Adams, and he used his wealth to promote the Whig cause.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=73}}<ref>Nobles, \"Old Republicans\", 269.</ref>{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=39}}\n\n===Townshend Acts===\nAfter the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a different approach to raising revenue, passing the [[Townshend Acts]] in 1767 which established new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a [[customs]] agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=49}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}}\n\nResistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly.

Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges.

Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, and was also elected as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=116}} In June 1773, he introduced a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|set of private letters]] to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London that there should be \"an abridgement of what are called English liberties\" in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that this is what he meant, but his career was effectively over in Massachusetts, and the House sent a petition asking the king to recall him.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=119}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=121}}<ref>Hutchinson maintained that he was predicting a curtailment of liberty, rather than recommending it; for the modern scholarly analysis of the letters affair, see Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson'' (Cambridge, 1974).</ref>\n\n===Tea Party===\nAdams took a leading role in the events that led up to the famous [[Boston Tea Party]] of December 16, 1773, although the precise nature of his involvement has been disputed.\n\nIn May 1773, the British Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]], a tax law to help the struggling [[East India Company]], one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea that it could not sell.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 248\u201349</ref>{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=334}} The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies.

The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]] were selected to receive the company's tea for resale.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=75}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=76}} In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=79}}\n\nNews of the Tea Act set off a firestorm of protest in the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=122}} This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act. Protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues. The familiar \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 246.</ref> Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}} The \"power of the purse\" conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=106}} Colonial smugglers played a significant role in the protests, since the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, which threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=102}}<ref>See also John W.

The [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to Great Britain for trial.

After a delay to rally support, Congress approved the language of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, which Adams signed.\n\nAfter the Declaration of Independence, Congress continued to manage the war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the [[Board of War]] in 1777.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=157}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=468}} He advocated paying bonuses to [[Continental Army]] soldiers to encourage them to reenlist for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=158}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=159}} He called for harsh state legislation to punish [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]\u2014Americans who continued to support the British crown\u2014who Adams believed were as dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=162}} After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=194}}\n\nAdams was the Massachusetts delegate appointed to the committee to draft the [[Articles of Confederation]], the plan for the colonial confederation. With its emphasis on state sovereignty, the Articles reflected Congress's wariness of a strong central government, a concern shared by Adams. Like others at the time, Adams considered himself a citizen of the United States while continuing to refer to Massachusetts as his \"country\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=163}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=197}} After much debate, the Articles were sent to the states for ratification in November 1777. From Philadelphia, Adams urged Massachusetts to ratify, which it did. Adams signed the Articles of Confederation with the other Massachusetts delegates in 1778, but they were not ratified by all the states until 1781.\n\nAdams returned to Boston in 1779 to attend a state constitutional convention. The Massachusetts General Court had proposed a new constitution the previous year, but voters rejected it, and so a convention was held to try again. Adams was appointed to a three-man drafting committee with his cousin John Adams and [[James Bowdoin]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=181}} They drafted the [[Massachusetts Constitution]], which was amended by the convention and approved by voters in 1780. The new constitution established a republican form of government, with annual elections and a [[separation of powers]]. It reflected Adams's belief that \"a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever that he has not approved of, either directly, or through his representatives\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}} By modern standards, the new constitution was not \"[[democracy|democratic]]\"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=183}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=185}}\n\nIn 1781, Adams retired from the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was approaching his sixtieth birthday and suffered from [[essential tremor|tremors]] that made writing difficult.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=167}} But he also wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}} He returned to Boston in 1781, and never left Massachusetts again.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=170}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=171}}\n\n==Return to Massachusetts==\nAdams remained active in politics upon his return to Massachusetts. He frequently served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, and was elected to the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]], where he often served as that body's [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|president]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams focused his political agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential in a republican government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Hancock; the two men had a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} Adams favored [[James Bowdoin]] for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=186}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=187}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams's promotion of public virtue took several forms. He played a major role in getting Boston to provide a free public education for children, even for girls, which was controversial.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=192}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=194}} Adams was one of the charter members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Charter of Incorporation|url=http://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx#chartermbrs|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103142200/https://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx#chartermbrs#chartermbrs|archive-date=January 3, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the Revolutionary War, Adams joined others, including Thomas Jefferson, in denouncing the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], an organization of former army officers. Adams worried that the  Society was \"a stride towards an hereditary military nobility\", and thus a threat to republicanism.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=196}} Adams also believed that public theaters undermined civic virtue, and he joined an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep theaters banned in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=404}} Decades after Adams's death, orator [[Edward Everett]] called him \"the last of the Puritans\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=47|loc=quoting Everett's 1835 \"Battle of Lexington\" oration}}\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=''I firmly believe that the benevolent Creator designed the republican Form of Government for Man.''|source=Samuel Adams, April 14, 1785{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=44}}<ref>Cushing, ''Writings'', 4:314</ref>}}\n\nPostwar economic troubles in western Massachusetts led to an uprising known as [[Shays's Rebellion]], which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties. Governor James Bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen to put down the uprising, an action supported by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}} His old political ally [[James Warren (politician)|James Warren]] thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays's Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that \"the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=30}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=31}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}\n\nShays's Rebellion contributed to the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], instead of revising the Articles, created a new [[United States Constitution]] with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. \"I confess,\" he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, \"as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}} Adams was one of those derisively labeled [[Anti-Federalism|\"Anti-Federalists\"]] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves \"Federalists\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=204}} Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts ratifying convention]] which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=205}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=206}} Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=260}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=261}} Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=207}}\n\nWhile Adams was attending the ratifying convention, his only son Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=255}} The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=219}}\n\nAdams was concerned about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the December 1788 election, but lost to [[Fisher Ames]], apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=210}} Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=211}} Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=215}}\n\nIn 1789, Adams was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts#Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] and served in that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting governor. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, the first of four annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]], who were opposed to the [[Federalist Party]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=213}} Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}} Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=217}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=227}} In that year's [[1796 United States presidential election|U.

The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=219}}\n\nSamuel Adams took a cue from President Washington, who declined to run for reelection in 1796: he retired from politics at the end of his term as governor in 1797.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=218}} Adams suffered from what is now believed to have been [[essential tremor]], a movement disorder that rendered him unable to write in the final decade of his life.<ref>{{cite web| title = Samuel Adams' tremor | publisher = Neurology (2001) 56:1201\u201305 (online abstract) | author = Elan D.

Thomas Jefferson, for example, characterized Adams as \"truly the ''Man of the Revolution''.\"{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=5}} Leaders in other colonies were compared to him; [[Cornelius Harnett]] was called the \"Samuel Adams of North Carolina\", [[Charles Thomson]] the \"Samuel Adams of Philadelphia\",{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}} and [[Christopher Gadsden]] the \"Sam Adams of the South\".<ref>E. Stanly Godbold, \"Gadsden, Christopher\"; ''American National Biography Online'',  February 2000.</ref> When John Adams traveled to France during the Revolution, he had to explain that he was not Samuel, \"the famous Adams\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}}\n\nSupporters of the Revolution praised Adams, but Loyalists viewed him as a sinister figure. [[Peter Oliver (jurist)|Peter Oliver]], the exiled chief justice of Massachusetts, characterized him as a devious [[Machiavelli]]an with a \"cloven Foot\".{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=82}} Thomas Hutchinson, Adams's political foe, took his revenge in his ''History of Massachusetts Bay'', in which he denounced him as a dishonest character assassin, emphasizing his failures as a businessman and tax collector. This hostile \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams was revived in the 20th century by historian Clifford K. Shipton in the ''[[Harvard College#Sibley's Harvard Graduates|Sibley's Harvard Graduates]]'' reference series.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=83}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}} Shipton wrote positive portraits of Hutchinson and Oliver and scathing sketches of Adams and Hancock; his entry on Adams was characterized by historian [[Pauline Maier]] as \"forty-five pages of contempt\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}\n\nWhig historians challenged the \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams. William Gordon and [[Mercy Otis Warren]], two historians who knew Adams, wrote of him as a man selflessly dedicated to the American Revolution.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}} But in the early 19th century, Adams was often viewed as an old-fashioned Puritan, and was consequently neglected by historians.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}} Interest in Adams was revived in the mid-19th century. Historian [[George Bancroft]] portrayed him favorably in his monumental ''History of the United States from the Discovery of the American Continent'' (1852). The first full biography of Adams appeared in 1865, a three-volume work written by William Wells, his great-grandson.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} The Wells biography is still valuable for its wealth of information,<ref name=\"ANB\" /> although Whig portrayals of Adams were uncritically pro-American and had elements of [[hagiography]], a view that influenced some later biographies written for general audiences.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=92}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=229}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=230}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, many American historians were uncomfortable with contemporary revolutions and found it problematic to write approvingly about Adams. Relations had improved between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and Adams's role in dividing Americans from Britons was increasingly viewed with regret.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=14}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} In 1885, James Hosmer wrote a biography that praised Adams, but also found some of his actions troubling, such as the 1773 publication of Hutchinson's private letters.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=9}} Subsequent biographers became increasingly hostile towards Adams and the common people whom he represented. In 1923, Ralph V. Harlow used a \"[[Freudian]]\" approach to characterize Adams as a \"neurotic crank\" driven by an \"inferiority complex\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}}<ref>See Ralph V. Harlow, ''Samuel Adams, Promoter of the American Revolution: A Study in Psychology and Politics'' (Holt, 1923).</ref> Harlow argued that, because the masses were easily misled, Adams \"manufactured public opinion\" to produce the Revolution, a view that became the thesis of John C. Miller's 1936 biography ''Sam Adams: Pioneer in Propaganda''.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}} Miller portrayed Adams more as an incendiary revolutionary than an adroit political operative, attributing to this one man all the acts of Boston's \"body of the people\", and consistently calling his subject \"Sam\", despite the fact that Adams was almost always known as \"Samuel\" in his lifetime.<ref name=\"ANB\" />{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=58}}{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=59}}\n\nMiller's influential book became, in the words of historian Charles Akers, the \"scholarly enshrinement\" of \"the myth of Sam Adams as the Boston dictator who almost single-handedly led his colony into rebellion\".<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 120\u201321.</ref> According to Akers, Miller and other historians used \"Sam did it\" to explain crowd actions and other developments, without citing any evidence that Adams directed those events.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 121\u201322.</ref> In 1974, Akers called on historians to critically re-examine the sources rather than simply repeating the myth.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 130.</ref> By then, scholars were increasingly rejecting the notion that Adams and others used \"propaganda\" to incite \"ignorant mobs\", and were instead portraying a revolutionary Massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=93}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=94}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=95}} Historian [[Pauline Maier]] argued that Adams, far from being a radical mob leader, took a moderate position based on the English revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority. That belief justified force only against threats to the constitutional rights so grave that the \"body of the people\" recognized the danger, and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed. Within that revolutionary tradition, resistance was essentially conservative.

He was a politician in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colonial Massachusetts]], a leader of the movement that became the [[American Revolution]], and one of the architects of the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]] that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President [[John Adams]].\n\nAdams was born in [[Boston]], brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of [[Harvard College]], he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and the [[Boston Town Meeting]] in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s efforts to tax the [[British America]]n colonies without their consent. His 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]] calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a [[committee of correspondence]] system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the [[British Constitution]] at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]] and the coming of the American Revolution.\n\nParliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] in 1774, at which time Adams attended the [[Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the [[Continental Association]] in 1774 and the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, and he helped draft the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[Massachusetts Constitution]]. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]] and was eventually elected governor.\n\nSamuel Adams later became a controversial figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams in the first half of the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of [[propaganda]] who provoked [[mob violence]] to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.\n\n==Early life==\nSamuel Adams was born in [[Boston]] in the British colony of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] on September 16, 1722, an [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] that is sometimes converted to the New Style date of September 27.{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=14}} Adams was one of twelve children born to [[Samuel Adams, Sr.]], and Mary (Fifield) Adams in an age of high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=4}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=22}} Adams's parents were devout [[Puritan]]s and members of the [[Old South Meeting House|Old South Congregational Church]]. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=21}} Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially [[virtue]].{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=41}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=42}}\n\nSamuel Adams, Sr. (1689\u20131748) was a prosperous merchant and church [[deacon]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=3}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}} Deacon Adams became a leading figure in Boston politics through an organization that became known as the [[Boston Caucus]], which promoted candidates who supported popular causes.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=19}} The Boston Caucus helped shape the agenda of the [[Boston Town Meeting]]. A New England [[town meeting]] is a form of [[local government]] with elected officials, and not just a gathering of citizens; according to historian [[William M. Fowler, Jr.|William Fowler]], it was \"the most democratic institution in the British empire\".{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}} Deacon Adams rose through the political ranks, becoming a justice of the peace, a [[Boston Board of Selectmen|selectman]], and a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=8}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}} He worked closely with [[Elisha Cooke, Jr.]] (1678\u20131737), the leader of the \"popular party\", a faction that resisted any encroachment by royal officials on the colonial rights embodied in the [[Massachusetts Charter]] of 1691.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}} In the coming years, members of the \"popular party\" became known as Whigs or [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A four-story brick building with many windows.|While at Harvard, Adams boarded at [[Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University|Massachusetts Hall]].{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=16}}]]\n\nThe younger Samuel Adams attended [[Boston Latin School]] and then entered [[Harvard College]] in 1736. His parents hoped that his schooling would prepare him for the ministry, but Adams gradually shifted his interest to politics.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=25}} After graduating in 1740, Adams continued his studies, earning a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] in 1743. In his thesis, he argued that it was \"lawful to resist the Supreme Magistrate, if the Commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved\", which indicated that his political views, like his father's, were oriented towards colonial rights.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=15}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=16}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=25}}\n\nAdams's life was greatly affected by his father's involvement in a banking controversy. In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a \"land bank\" which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=21}} The land bank was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]]. Opposition to the land bank came from the more aristocratic \"court party\", who were supporters of the [[list of colonial governors of Massachusetts|royal governor]] and controlled the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Governor's Council]], the upper chamber of the General Court.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=5}} The court party used its influence to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] dissolve the land bank in 1741.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=23}} Directors of the land bank, including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams's death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=10}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=12}} For Adams, these lawsuits \"served as a constant personal reminder that Britain's power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=12}}\n\n==Early career==\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1743, Adams was unsure about his future. He considered becoming a lawyer, but instead decided to go into business. He worked at Thomas Cushing's [[counting house]], but the job only lasted a few months because Cushing felt that Adams was too preoccupied with politics to become a good merchant.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=3}} Adams's father then lent him [[Massachusetts pound|\u00a3]]1,000 to go into business for himself, a substantial amount for that time.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=3}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=4}} Adams's lack of business instincts were confirmed; he lent half of this money to a friend who never repaid, and frittered away the other half. Adams always remained, in the words of historian [[Pauline Maier]], \"a man utterly uninterested in either making or possessing money\".<ref name=\"ANB\">Maier, ''American National Biography''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Old South Meetinghouse BW.jpg|thumb|175px|alt=On a city street, an old brick church with a tall steeple is surrounded by modern buildings.|The [[Old South Meeting House]] (''1968 photo shown'') was Adams's church. During the crisis with Great Britain, mass meetings were held here that were too large for [[Faneuil Hall]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=58}}]]\n\nAfter Adams had lost his money, his father made him a partner in the family's [[malthouse]], which was next to the family home on Purchase Street. Several generations of Adamses were maltsters, who produced the [[malt]] necessary for [[brewing]] beer.{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=74}} Years later, a poet poked fun at Adams by calling him \"Sam the maltster\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=24}} Adams has often been described as a brewer, but the extant evidence suggests that he worked as a maltster and not a brewer.{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=74}}{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=75}}<ref>Stoll  (''Samuel Adams'', 275n16) notes that [[James Koch]], founder of the [[Boston Beer Company]], reports having been offered for purchase a receipt for [[hops]] signed by Adams, which indicates that Adams may have done some brewing.</ref>\n\nIn January 1748, Adams and some friends were inflamed by British [[impressment]] and launched ''[[The Independent Advertiser]]'', a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=17}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=18}} His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]'', and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=21}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}} He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}} He cited the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] as an example of what could happen to [[New England]] if it were to abandon its Puritan values.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=19}}\n\nWhen Deacon Adams died in 1748, Adams was given the responsibility of managing the family's affairs.{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=30}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=31}} In October 1749, he married Elizabeth Checkley, his pastor's daughter.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=34}} Elizabeth gave birth to six children over the next seven years, but only two lived to adulthood: Samuel (born 1751) and Hannah (born 1756).{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}} In July 1757, Elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=31}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=32}} Adams remarried in 1764 to Elizabeth Wells,{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=55}} but had no other children.<ref name=\"ANB\" />\n\nLike his father, Adams embarked on a political career with the support of the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market.

Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=54}}\n\n==Struggle with Great Britain==\nSamuel Adams emerged as an important public figure in Boston soon after the [[British Empire]]'s victory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of [[British America]] for the first time.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=50}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}} This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.</ref>\n\n===Sugar Act===\nThe first step in the new program was the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, which Adams saw as an infringement of longstanding colonial rights.

As was customary, the town meeting provided the representatives with a set of written instructions, which Adams was selected to write. Adams highlighted what he perceived to be the dangers of [[taxation without representation]]:\n\n<blockquote>For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & everything we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves?{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}<ref>The complete text is in Cushing, ''Writings'', 1:1\u20137.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"When the Boston Town Meeting approved the Adams instructions on May 24, 1764,\" writes historian John K.

The directives also contained the first official recommendation that the colonies present a unified defense of their rights.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Adams's instructions were published in newspapers and pamphlets, and he soon became closely associated with [[James Otis, Jr.]], a member of the Massachusetts House famous for his defense of colonial rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Otis boldly challenged the constitutionality of certain acts of Parliament, but he would not go as far as Adams, who was moving towards the conclusion that Parliament did not have sovereignty over the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=22}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=53}}\n\n===Stamp Act===\nIn 1765, Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] which required colonists to pay a new tax on most printed materials.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=18}} News of the passage of the Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=50}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=51}} The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions.

He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn Boston, a group called the [[Loyal Nine]], a precursor to the [[Sons of Liberty]], organized protests of the Stamp Act.

Adams was re-elected to the House and selected as its clerk, in which position he was responsible for official House papers.

These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a [[customs]] agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=49}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}}\n\nResistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not in session when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams therefore used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'', a series of popular essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}}\n\nIn January 1768, the Massachusetts House sent a petition to King George asking for his help.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}}<ref>In London, the petition to the king was published, along with other documents, by [[Thomas Hollis (1720\u20131774)|Thomas Hollis]] under the title \"The True Sentiments of America\"</ref>{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=109}} Adams and Otis requested that the House send the petition to the other colonies, along with what became known as the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], which became \"a significant milestone on the road to revolution\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}} The letter written by Adams called on the colonies to join with Massachusetts in resisting the Townshend Acts.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=78}} The House initially voted against sending the letter and petition to the other colonies but, after some politicking by Adams and Otis, it was approved on February 11.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=78}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=79}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=80}}\n\nBritish [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial secretary]] [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], hoping to prevent a repeat of the Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter.

The Tea Act permitted the East India Company to export tea directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=67}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=70}} This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the Tea Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]] were selected to receive the company's tea for resale.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=75}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=76}} In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=79}}\n\nNews of the Tea Act set off a firestorm of protest in the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=122}} This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act. Protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues. The familiar \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 246.</ref> Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}} The \"power of the purse\" conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=106}} Colonial smugglers played a significant role in the protests, since the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, which threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=102}}<ref>See also John W.

The first of these acts was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed Boston's commerce until the East India Company had been repaid for the destroyed tea. The [[Massachusetts Government Act]] rewrote the Massachusetts Charter, making many officials royally appointed rather than elected, and severely restricting the activities of town meetings. The [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to Great Britain for trial. A new royal governor was appointed to enforce the acts: General [[Thomas Gage]], who was also commander of British military forces in North America.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=130}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=131}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=132}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=133}}\n\nAdams worked to coordinate resistance to the Coercive Acts.

After a delay to rally support, Congress approved the language of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, which Adams signed.\n\nAfter the Declaration of Independence, Congress continued to manage the war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the [[Board of War]] in 1777.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=157}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=468}} He advocated paying bonuses to [[Continental Army]] soldiers to encourage them to reenlist for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=158}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=159}} He called for harsh state legislation to punish [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]\u2014Americans who continued to support the British crown\u2014who Adams believed were as dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=162}} After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=194}}\n\nAdams was the Massachusetts delegate appointed to the committee to draft the [[Articles of Confederation]], the plan for the colonial confederation. With its emphasis on state sovereignty, the Articles reflected Congress's wariness of a strong central government, a concern shared by Adams. Like others at the time, Adams considered himself a citizen of the United States while continuing to refer to Massachusetts as his \"country\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=163}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=197}} After much debate, the Articles were sent to the states for ratification in November 1777. From Philadelphia, Adams urged Massachusetts to ratify, which it did. Adams signed the Articles of Confederation with the other Massachusetts delegates in 1778, but they were not ratified by all the states until 1781.\n\nAdams returned to Boston in 1779 to attend a state constitutional convention. The Massachusetts General Court had proposed a new constitution the previous year, but voters rejected it, and so a convention was held to try again. Adams was appointed to a three-man drafting committee with his cousin John Adams and [[James Bowdoin]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=181}} They drafted the [[Massachusetts Constitution]], which was amended by the convention and approved by voters in 1780. The new constitution established a republican form of government, with annual elections and a [[separation of powers]]. It reflected Adams's belief that \"a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever that he has not approved of, either directly, or through his representatives\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}} By modern standards, the new constitution was not \"[[democracy|democratic]]\"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=183}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=185}}\n\nIn 1781, Adams retired from the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was approaching his sixtieth birthday and suffered from [[essential tremor|tremors]] that made writing difficult.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=167}} But he also wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}} He returned to Boston in 1781, and never left Massachusetts again.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=170}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=171}}\n\n==Return to Massachusetts==\nAdams remained active in politics upon his return to Massachusetts. He frequently served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, and was elected to the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]], where he often served as that body's [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|president]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams focused his political agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential in a republican government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Hancock; the two men had a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} Adams favored [[James Bowdoin]] for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=186}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=187}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams's promotion of public virtue took several forms.

Adams worried that the  Society was \"a stride towards an hereditary military nobility\", and thus a threat to republicanism.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=196}} Adams also believed that public theaters undermined civic virtue, and he joined an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep theaters banned in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=404}} Decades after Adams's death, orator [[Edward Everett]] called him \"the last of the Puritans\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=47|loc=quoting Everett's 1835 \"Battle of Lexington\" oration}}\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=''I firmly believe that the benevolent Creator designed the republican Form of Government for Man.''|source=Samuel Adams, April 14, 1785{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=44}}<ref>Cushing, ''Writings'', 4:314</ref>}}\n\nPostwar economic troubles in western Massachusetts led to an uprising known as [[Shays's Rebellion]], which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties. Governor James Bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen to put down the uprising, an action supported by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}} His old political ally [[James Warren (politician)|James Warren]] thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays's Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that \"the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=30}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=31}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}\n\nShays's Rebellion contributed to the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], instead of revising the Articles, created a new [[United States Constitution]] with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. \"I confess,\" he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, \"as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}} Adams was one of those derisively labeled [[Anti-Federalism|\"Anti-Federalists\"]] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves \"Federalists\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=204}} Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts ratifying convention]] which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=205}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=206}} Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=260}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=261}} Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=207}}\n\nWhile Adams was attending the ratifying convention, his only son Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=255}} The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years.

He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the December 1788 election, but lost to [[Fisher Ames]], apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=210}} Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=211}} Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=215}}\n\nIn 1789, Adams was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts#Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] and served in that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting governor. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, the first of four annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]], who were opposed to the [[Federalist Party]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=213}} Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}} Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=217}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=227}} In that year's [[1796 United States presidential election|U.

Disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to the present.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=8}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=82}}\n\nAdams' contemporaries, both friends and foes, regarded him as one of the foremost leaders of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson, for example, characterized Adams as \"truly the ''Man of the Revolution''.\"{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=5}} Leaders in other colonies were compared to him; [[Cornelius Harnett]] was called the \"Samuel Adams of North Carolina\", [[Charles Thomson]] the \"Samuel Adams of Philadelphia\",{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}} and [[Christopher Gadsden]] the \"Sam Adams of the South\".<ref>E. Stanly Godbold, \"Gadsden, Christopher\"; ''American National Biography Online'',  February 2000.</ref> When John Adams traveled to France during the Revolution, he had to explain that he was not Samuel, \"the famous Adams\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}}\n\nSupporters of the Revolution praised Adams, but Loyalists viewed him as a sinister figure. [[Peter Oliver (jurist)|Peter Oliver]], the exiled chief justice of Massachusetts, characterized him as a devious [[Machiavelli]]an with a \"cloven Foot\".{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=82}} Thomas Hutchinson, Adams' political foe, took his revenge in his ''History of Massachusetts Bay'', in which he denounced him as a dishonest character assassin, emphasizing his failures as a businessman and tax collector. This hostile \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams was revived in the 20th century by historian Clifford K. Shipton in the ''[[Harvard College#Sibley's Harvard Graduates|Sibley's Harvard Graduates]]'' reference series.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=83}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}} Shipton wrote positive portraits of Hutchinson and Oliver and scathing sketches of Adams and Hancock; his entry on Adams was characterized by historian [[Pauline Maier]] as \"forty-five pages of contempt\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}\n\nWhig historians challenged the \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams. William Gordon and [[Mercy Otis Warren]], two historians who knew Adams, wrote of him as a man selflessly dedicated to the American Revolution.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}} But in the early 19th century, Adams was often viewed as an old-fashioned Puritan, and was consequently neglected by historians.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}} Interest in Adams was revived in the mid-19th century. Historian [[George Bancroft]] portrayed him favorably in his monumental ''History of the United States from the Discovery of the American Continent'' (1852). The first full biography of Adams appeared in 1865, a three-volume work written by William Wells, his great-grandson.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} The Wells biography is still valuable for its wealth of information,<ref name=\"ANB\" /> although Whig portrayals of Adams were uncritically pro-American and had elements of [[hagiography]], a view that influenced some later biographies written for general audiences.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=92}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=229}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=230}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, many American historians were uncomfortable with contemporary revolutions and found it problematic to write approvingly about Adams. Relations had improved between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and Adams' role in dividing Americans from Britons was increasingly viewed with regret.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=14}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} In 1885, James Hosmer wrote a biography that praised Adams, but also found some of his actions troubling, such as the 1773 publication of Hutchinson's private letters.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=9}} Subsequent biographers became increasingly hostile towards Adams and the common people whom he represented. In 1923, Ralph V. Harlow used a \"[[Freudian]]\" approach to characterize Adams as a \"neurotic crank\" driven by an \"inferiority complex\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}}<ref>See Ralph V. Harlow, ''Samuel Adams, Promoter of the American Revolution: A Study in Psychology and Politics'' (Holt, 1923).</ref> Harlow argued that, because the masses were easily misled, Adams \"manufactured public opinion\" to produce the Revolution, a view that became the thesis of John C. Miller's 1936 biography ''Sam Adams: Pioneer in Propaganda''.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}} Miller portrayed Adams more as an incendiary revolutionary than an adroit political operative, attributing to this one man all the acts of Boston's \"body of the people\", and consistently calling his subject \"Sam\", despite the fact that Adams was almost always known as \"Samuel\" in his lifetime.<ref name=\"ANB\" />{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=58}}{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=59}}\n\nMiller's influential book became, in the words of historian Charles Akers, the \"scholarly enshrinement\" of \"the myth of Sam Adams as the Boston dictator who almost single-handedly led his colony into rebellion\".<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 120\u201321.</ref> According to Akers, Miller and other historians used \"Sam did it\" to explain crowd actions and other developments, without citing any evidence that Adams directed those events.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 121\u201322.</ref> In 1974, Akers called on historians to critically re-examine the sources rather than simply repeating the myth.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 130.</ref> By then, scholars were increasingly rejecting the notion that Adams and others used \"propaganda\" to incite \"ignorant mobs\", and were instead portraying a revolutionary Massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=93}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=94}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=95}} Historian [[Pauline Maier]] argued that Adams, far from being a radical mob leader, took a moderate position based on the English revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority. That belief justified force only against threats to the constitutional rights so grave that the \"body of the people\" recognized the danger, and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed. Within that revolutionary tradition, resistance was essentially conservative. In 2004, [[Ray Raphael]]'s ''Founding Myths'' continued Maier's line by deconstructing several of the \"Sam\" Adams myths that are still repeated in many textbooks and popular histories.{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=45-63}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 2008 miniseries [[John Adams (miniseries)|''John Adams'']], Samuel Adams was played by [[Danny Huston]].\n\nAdams is the main protagonist in the 2015 miniseries [[Sons of Liberty (miniseries)|''Sons of Liberty'']], portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]].\n\nSamuel Adams's name has been appropriated by commercial and non-profit ventures since his death.

Like the MiG-25, its flight surfaces are built primarily of nickel-steel alloy, enabling the aircraft to tolerate [[Aerodynamic heating|kinetic heating]] at airspeeds approaching Mach 3.

Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a [[centre stick]] and left hand [[throttle]]s. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports on the sides of the canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency.

Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a [[centre stick]] and left hand [[throttle]]s. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports on the sides of the canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency. Both cockpits are fitted with zero/zero [[ejection seat]]s which allow the crew to eject at any altitude and airspeed.<ref name=\"Dawes\" />\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:MiG-31 Foxhound aircraft armed with AA-9 missiles in flight.jpg|thumb|MiG-31 armed with [[R-33 (missile)|R-33]] missiles]]\n\nThe MiG-31's main armament is four [[Vympel R-33|R-33]] [[air-to-air missile]]s ([[NATO]] codename AA-9 'Amos') carried under the belly. \n*One [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23|GSh-6-23]] 23&nbsp;mm cannon with 260 rounds.\n*Fuselage recesses for four [[R-33 (missile)|R-33 (AA-9 'Amos')]] or six [[R-37 (missile)|R-37 (AA-13 'Arrow')]] (MiG-31M/BM only).\n*Four underwing pylons for a combination of (six places for charging<ref>{{cite web|url=http://samolet-mig-31.narod.ru|title=\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u041c\u0438\u0413-31|author=\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d|work=narod.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021075126/http://samolet-mig-31.narod.ru/|archive-date=21 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (two spaces to add removable fuel tanks<ref name=\"encyclopaedia-russia.ru\" />)):\n**Six [[R-37 (missile)]] long-range missiles {{convert|280|km|mi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/fighter/mig31bm.html|title=\u041c\u0438\u0413 \u041c\u0438\u0413-31\u0411\u041c|work=airwar.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709015818/http://www.airwar.ru/enc/fighter/mig31bm.html|archive-date=9 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n**Four<ref name=\"arms-expo.ru\" />) [[R-33 (missile)]] long-range missiles {{convert|300|km|mi}} 2012.<ref name=\"dokwar.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://dokwar.ru/publ/aviacija_i_flot/mig_31bm_poluchat_novuju_raketu/15-1-0-583|title=\u041c\u0438\u0413-31\u0411\u041c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0443|work=dokwar.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027091756/http://dokwar.ru/publ/aviacija_i_flot/mig_31bm_poluchat_novuju_raketu/15-1-0-583|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n** (?)\u00d7 Kh-31 long-range missiles (200&nbsp;km) for high-speed target (maneuvering with an overload of 8&nbsp;G).<ref name=\"dokwar.ru\" />\n** (?)\u00d7 R-33 AA-9 \"Amos\" (1981) {{convert|120|km|mi}}, R-33S (1999) {{convert|160|km|mi}}.<ref>http://\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438.\u0440\u0444/russia/vympel/r/33/r33_1.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027092514/http://xn--80akhcovnjb1g.xn--p1ai/russia/vympel/r/33/r33_1.htm |date=27 October 2014 }}</ref>\n**Two<ref name=\"arms-expo.ru\" /> or four (superior limit)<ref name=\"modernforces.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.modernforces.ru/mig-31b/|title=\u041c\u0438\u0413-31\u0411|work=modernforces.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104802/http://www.modernforces.ru/mig-31b/|archive-date=29 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\u00d7 [[R-40 (missile)|R-40TD1 (AA-6 'Acrid')]] medium-range missiles (R-40 ({{convert|50|km|mi}}, MiG-25P, 1970) {{convert|80|km|mi}}(PD)(user)), height of applications between {{convert|0.5|-|3|km|mi}} (maneuvering with overload four&nbsp;g).<ref>http://\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438.\u0440\u0444/russia/bisnovat/r/40/r40.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422073038/http://xn--80akhcovnjb1g.xn--p1ai/russia/bisnovat/r/40/r40.htm |date=22 April 2016 }}</ref>\n**Four [[R-60 (missile)|R-60 (AA-8 'Aphid')]]\n***Four [[R-73 (missile)|R-73 (AA-11 'Archer')]] short-range IR missiles,\n***Four [[R-77]] (AA-12 'Adder') medium-range missiles (100 km) for high-speed target (maneuvering with overload of 12 G).<ref>http://\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438.\u0440\u0444/russia/vympel/r/77/r77.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510150627/http://xn--80akhcovnjb1g.xn--p1ai/russia/vympel/r/77/r77.htm |date=10 May 2017 }}</ref>\n*Some aircraft are equipped to launch the [[AS-17 Krypton|Kh-31P (AS-17 'Krypton')]] and [[AS-11 Kilter|Kh-58 (AS-11 'Kilter')]] [[anti-radiation missile]]s in the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] (SEAD) role.
