(2012). [http://uxpamagazine.org/dear-diary-using-diaries-to-study-user-experience/ Dear Diary: Using Diaries to Study User Experience][http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/11-3/ UX Magazine 11.3, August 2012.]</ref>\nThey allow:\n\n* collecting longitudinal and temporal information;\n* reporting events and experiences in context and in-the-moment;\n* participants to diary their behaviours, thoughts and feelings in-the-moment thereby minimising the potential for post rationalisation;\n* determining the antecedents, correlations, and consequences of daily experiences and behaviors.\n\n==Limitations==\nThere are some limitations of diary studies, mainly due to their characteristics of reliance on [[memory]] and [[Self-report study|self-report]] measures.\n\nThere is low control, low participation and there is a risk of disturbing the action. \nIn feedback studies, it can be troubling and disturbing to write everything down.<ref>Kuniavsky, Observing the User Experience, A Practitioner's Guide to User Research September 21, 2012, {{ISBN|0123848695}}.</ref>\n\n=== Inaccurate recall ===\nThe [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of diary studies rests on the assumption that participants will accurately recall and record their experiences. This is somewhat more easily enabled by the fact that diaries are completed & media is captured in a natural environment and closer, in real-time, to any occurrences of the phenomenon of interest. However, there are multiple barriers to obtaining accurate data, such as:\n\n* [[Social desirability bias]] - where participants may answer in a way that makes them appear more socially desirable.\u00a0 This may be more prominent in longitudinal studies where participants frequently communicate with researchers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Legg|first=C.|last2=Puri|first2=A.|last3=Thomas|first3=N.|date=2000|title=Dietary restraint and self-reported meal sizes: diary studies with differentially informed consent|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195666300903143|journal=Appetite|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=235\u2013243|doi=10.1006/appe.2000.0314|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Recall bias]] - where participants recall events or feelings inaccurately due to systematic errors. Human memory is unreliable, as it is an [[Reconstructive memory|active reconstruction]] which is susceptible to errors and biases.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Arthur A|last2=Shiffman|first2=Saul|last3=Schwartz|first3=Joseph E|last4=Broderick|first4=Joan E|last5=Hufford|first5=Michael R|date=2003|title=Patient compliance with paper and electronic diaries|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0197245602003203|journal=Controlled Clinical Trials|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=182\u2013199|doi=10.1016/S0197-2456(02)00320-3|via=}}</ref> For example, after recording their [[Emotion|emotions]] in daily diaries, older adults tended to recall more positive emotions than younger adults, while younger adults tended to recall more negative emotions than older adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ready|first=Rebecca E.|last2=Weinberger|first2=Mark I.|last3=Jones|first3=Kelly M.|date=2007|title=How happy have you felt lately?

For example, a diary study assessing the drinking urges of recently treated alcoholics found that, if/when participants began to drink alcohol, they tended to stop recording in their diary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Litt|first=Mark D.|last2=Cooney|first2=Ned L.|last3=Morse|first3=Priscilla|date=1998|title=Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with treated alcoholics: Methodological problems and potential solutions.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.1.48|journal=Health Psychology|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.1.48|issn=1930-7810|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-compliance and retrospective entries ===\nDiary studies tend to dictate specific times or a frequency at which the participant should complete their diary entries or capture media. This is usually a time that is close to the event or phenomenon of interest to the researcher, and it is assumed that participants will comply with these instructions. However, researchers often find it difficult to verify the extent to which this assumption is met, and have observed various forms of non-compliance. One example of this is hoarding, where previously-missed entries are 'backfilled' or completed all at once, therefore being completed retrospectively rather than at the assigned time. A further example of this is where entries are 'forward-filled', i.e. recorded for a future date.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nResearchers have found significant rates of non-compliance and entries written [[Retrospective|retrospectively]] in feedback studies. A study by Hyland and colleagues (1993) estimated that that the percentage of errors in paper and pencil diaries could be anywhere from 2-24%,<ref name=\":1\" /> due to diaries written retrospectively and/or due to inaccuracies in recording. Another study by Stone and colleagues (2003) compared paper diaries versus compliance-enhancing electronic diaries. The paper diaries contained a hidden instrument which detected when the diary was opened - from this, actual compliance rate was found to be only 11%, while 79% of entries were faked, i.e. not written within 30 minutes of the assigned time. In contrast, the electronic diaries created timestamps for each entry, which prevented the possibility of fake timestamped entries, and therefore yielded a compliance rate of 94%.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Notable diary studies ==\nIn 2015, a diary study was conducted at a Dutch University of Applied Sciences to evaluate how learning spaces affect students' learning activities. 52 business management students kept records of the learning activities that they worked on, where they worked on them, and why they worked there for a week. Through evaluating the diary entries of this study, researchers found a significant correlation between the spaces in which students chose to work and their learning activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beckers|first=Ronald|last2=Voordt|first2=Theo van der|last3=Dewulf|first3=Geert|date=2016-01-02|title=Why do they study there?

They can be beneficial when one is looking to find new qualitative and quantitative data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/diary-studies|title=How to Do Diary Studies, a Great Alternative to Field Studies|website=www.userinterviews.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nAdvantages of diary studies are numerous.<ref>Lallemand, C. (2012). [http://uxpamagazine.org/dear-diary-using-diaries-to-study-user-experience/ Dear Diary: Using Diaries to Study User Experience][http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/11-3/ UX Magazine 11.3, August 2012.]</ref>\nThey allow:\n\n* collecting longitudinal and temporal information;\n* reporting events and experiences in context and in-the-moment;\n* participants to diary their behaviours, thoughts and feelings in-the-moment thereby minimising the potential for post rationalisation;\n* determining the antecedents, correlations, and consequences of daily experiences and behaviors.\n\n==Limitations==\nThere are some limitations of diary studies, mainly due to their characteristics of reliance on [[memory]] and [[Self-report study|self-report]] measures.\n\nDiary studies might generate inaccurate [[recall (memory)|recall]], especially if using the elicitation type of diary studies, because of the use of memory triggers (e.g. taking a photo and writing about it later). There is low control, low participation and there is a risk of disturbing the action. \nIn feedback studies, there is also low control, and it can be troubling and disturbing to write everything down.<ref>Kuniavsky, Observing the User Experience, A Practitioner's Guide to User Research September 21, 2012, {{ISBN|0123848695}}.</ref>\n\n=== Inaccurate recall ===\nThe [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of diary studies rests on the assumption that participants will accurately recall and record their experiences. This is somewhat more easily enabled by the fact that diaries are completed & media is captured in a natural environment and closer, in real-time, to any occurrences of the phenomenon of interest. However, there are multiple barriers to obtaining accurate data, such as:\n\n* [[Social desirability bias]] - where participants may answer in a way that makes them appear more socially desirable.\u00a0 This may be more prominent in longitudinal studies where participants frequently communicate with researchers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Legg|first=C.|last2=Puri|first2=A.|last3=Thomas|first3=N.|date=2000|title=Dietary restraint and self-reported meal sizes: diary studies with differentially informed consent|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195666300903143|journal=Appetite|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=235\u2013243|doi=10.1006/appe.2000.0314|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Recall bias]] - where participants recall events or feelings inaccurately due to systematic errors. Human memory is unreliable, as it is an [[Reconstructive memory|active reconstruction]] which is susceptible to errors and biases.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Arthur A|last2=Shiffman|first2=Saul|last3=Schwartz|first3=Joseph E|last4=Broderick|first4=Joan E|last5=Hufford|first5=Michael R|date=2003|title=Patient compliance with paper and electronic diaries|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0197245602003203|journal=Controlled Clinical Trials|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=182\u2013199|doi=10.1016/S0197-2456(02)00320-3|via=}}</ref> For example, after recording their [[Emotion|emotions]] in daily diaries, older adults tended to recall more positive emotions than younger adults, while younger adults tended to recall more negative emotions than older adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ready|first=Rebecca E.|last2=Weinberger|first2=Mark I.|last3=Jones|first3=Kelly M.|date=2007|title=How happy have you felt lately?

For example, a diary study assessing the drinking urges of recently treated alcoholics found that, if/when participants began to drink alcohol, they tended to stop recording in their diary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Litt|first=Mark D.|last2=Cooney|first2=Ned L.|last3=Morse|first3=Priscilla|date=1998|title=Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with treated alcoholics: Methodological problems and potential solutions.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.1.48|journal=Health Psychology|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.1.48|issn=1930-7810|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-compliance and retrospective entries ===\nDiary studies tend to dictate specific times or a frequency at which the participant should complete their diary entries or capture media. This is usually a time that is close to the event or phenomenon of interest to the researcher, and it is assumed that participants will comply with these instructions. However, researchers often find it difficult to verify the extent to which this assumption is met, and have observed various forms of non-compliance. One example of this is hoarding, where previously-missed entries are 'backfilled' or completed all at once, therefore being completed retrospectively rather than at the assigned time. A further example of this is where entries are 'forward-filled', i.e. recorded for a future date.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nResearchers have found concerning rates of non-compliance and entries written [[Retrospective|retrospectively]] in feedback studies. A study by Hyland and colleagues (1993) estimated that that the percentage of errors in paper and pencil diaries could be anywhere from 2-24%,<ref name=\":1\" /> due to diaries written retrospectively and/or due to inaccuracies in recording. Another study by Stone and colleagues (2003) compared paper diaries versus compliance-enhancing electronic diaries. The paper diaries contained a hidden instrument which detected when the diary was opened - from this, actual compliance rate was found to be only 11%, while 79% of entries were faked, i.e. not written within 30 minutes of the assigned time. In contrast, the electronic diaries created timestamps for each entry, which prevented the possibility of fake timestamped entries, and therefore yielded a compliance rate of 94%.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Notable Diary Studies ==\nIn 2015, a diary study was conducted at a Dutch University of Applied Sciences to evaluate how learning spaces affect students' learning activities. 52 business management students kept records of the learning activities that they worked on, where they worked on them, and why they worked there for a week. Through evaluating the diary entries of this study, researchers found a significant correlation between the spaces in which students chose to work and their learning activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beckers|first=Ronald|last2=Voordt|first2=Theo van der|last3=Dewulf|first3=Geert|date=2016-01-02|title=Why do they study there?

Below this was a chamber sealed by tons of loose stone fill.<ref name=\"urlNG-Royal Tomb in Peru\"/>\n\nThe burial chamber of the royal tomb was discovered in early 2013 by a Peruvian-Polish research team, which was led by [[Milosz Giersz]] of Poland's [[University of Warsaw]] and co-director [[Roberto Pimentel Nita]] and funded by the [[National Geographic Society]].<ref name=\"Vergano\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2013/06/27/wari-tomb-queens-peru/2464645/|title='Temple of the dead' discovered in Peru|work=[[USA Today]]|first=Dan|last=Vergano|accessdate=June 28, 2013|date=June 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe tomb contained 1,200 artifacts, including gold earrings, bronze axes, jewelry made of copper and silver, and silver bowls.<ref name=\"Vergano\" /> The tomb contained 60 human bodies buried in rows in a seated position and clothed in deteroriating textiles. Three side chambers contained three bodies of royal Wari women whose bodies were accompanied by prized possessions, including gold weaving tools. Giersz said  \"We are talking about the first unearthed royal imperial tomb of the Wari.\"  The richness of this mausoleum is a strong indication of the extent to which the Wari controlled this part of northern Peru. Giersz found evidence that the royal bodies had been repeatedly removed from the burial chambers, presumably for royal displays during the Wari era, an indication of royal ancestor worship.<ref name=\"urlNG-Royal Tomb in Peru\">{{cite web\n|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130627-peru-archaeology-wari-south-america-human-sacrifice-royal-ancient-world\n|title=First Unlooted Royal Tomb of Its Kind Unearthed in Peru\n|accessdate=2013-06-30\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History|Peru}}\n* [[2013 in archaeology]]\n* [[Huarmey]]\n* [[Wari culture]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord|10.0500|S|78.1333|W|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:2013 archaeological discoveries]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Ancash Region]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Peru]]\n[[Category:Tombs in Peru]]\n[[Category:Wari culture]]\n", "name_user": "CamWass", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Castillo_de_Huarmey"}

Three subtypes of PPARs are known: [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|PPAR-alpha]], [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta|PPAR-delta]], and PPAR-gamma. The protein encoded by this gene is PPAR-gamma and is a regulator of [[adipocyte]] differentiation.

This modification decreases transcriptional activity of PPARG and leads to diabetic gene modifications, and results in insulin insensitivity. For example, the phosphorylation of serine 112 will inhibit PPARG function, and enhance adipogenic potential of fibroblasts.\n\n== Function ==\nPPARG regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism.
