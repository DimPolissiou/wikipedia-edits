Coupled chromatography - [[Mass spectrometry|MS]] systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of each technique are enhanced synergistically. While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass spectrometry provides structural identity of the individual components with high molecular specificity and detection sensitivity. This tandem technique can be used to analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, LC-MS may be applied in a wide range of sectors including [[biotechnology]], environment monitoring, [[food processing]], and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[agrochemical]], and [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] industries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Recent Advances in Redox Active Plant and Microbial Products|last=Chaimbault|first=Patrick|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401789523|editor-last=Jacob|editor-first=Claus|pages=31\u201394|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-8953-0_3|editor-last2=Kirsch|editor-first2=Gilbert|editor-last3=Slusarenko|editor-first3=Alan|editor-last4=Winyard|editor-first4=Paul G.|editor-last5=Burkholz|editor-first5=Torsten|chapter = The Modern Art of Identification of Natural Substances in Whole Plants}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Contemporary Mass Spectrometry|last=Dass|first=Chhabil|date=2007-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470118498|pages=151\u2013194|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470118498.ch5|chapter = Hyphenated Separation Techniques}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers the separated components from the LC column into the MS ion source.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pitt|first=James J|date=2017-03-12|title=Principles and Applications of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry in Clinical Biochemistry|journal=The Clinical Biochemist Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=19\u201334|issn=0159-8090|pmc=2643089|pmid=19224008}}</ref> The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under high vacuum (around 10<sup>\u22126</sup> torr / 10<sup>\u22127</sup> \"Hg). Thus, it is not possible to directly pump the [[Elution|eluate]] from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the chemical identity of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), [[Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization|atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI), and [[Photoionization|atmospheric pressure photo-ionization]] (APPI).These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History of LC-MS ==\nThe coupling of chromatography with MS is a well developed chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. [[Gas chromatography]] (GC)'''\u2013'''MS was originally introduced in 1952, when A.T. James and A.J.P. Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=A. T.|last2=Martin|first2=A. J.

Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than LC-MS and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s.<ref name=\":1\" /> The development of LC-MS systems took longer than GC-MS and was directly related to the development of proper interfaces. V.L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of LC-MS in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tal'roze|first=V.L.|last2=Gorodetskii|first2=I.G.|last3=Zolotoy|first3=N.B|last4=Karpov|first4=G.V.|last5=Skurat|first5=V.E.|last6=Maslennikova|first6=V.Ya.|year=1978|title=Capillary system for continuous introducing of volatile liquids into analytical MS and its application|url=|journal=Adv. Mass Spectrom|volume=7|pages=858|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" /> A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for LC-MS had the same analysis capabilities of [[Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary was one of the main issues. Within the first years of development of LC-MS, on-line and off-line alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes. Off-line analyte treatment process was time consuming and there was an inherent risk of sample contamination. Rapidly, it was realized that the analysis of complex mixtures would require the development of a fully automated on-line coupling solution in LC-MS.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Third Edition|last=Niessen|first=Wilfried M.

This interface consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and [[Fast atom bombardment|fast-atom bombardment]] (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were [[Sector mass spectrometer|magnetic sector]] and [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadropole]] instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied in the analysis of drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Liquid Chromatography \u2013 Mass Spectrometry: An Introduction|last=Ardrey|first=Robert E.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470867297|pages=1\u20135|language=en|doi=10.1002/0470867299.ch1|chapter = Introduction|series = Analytical Techniques in the Sciences (AnTS)}}</ref>\n\n=== Direct liquid introduction interface ===\nThe direct liquid introduction (DLI) interface was developed in 1980. This interface was thought as a solution to the evaporation of liquid inside the capillary inlet interface. In DLI, a nebulizer was used to disintegrate part of the effluent coming from the column. A small diaphragm was used to form a liquid jet composed of small droplets that were subsequently dried in a desolvation chamber. A microbore capillary column was used to transfer the nebulized liquid product to the MS ion source. The analytes were ionized using a solvent assisted chemical ionization source, where the LC solvents acted as reagent gases. To use this interface, it was necessary to split the flow coming out of the LC column because only a small portion of the effluent (10 to 50 \u03bcl/min out of 1 ml/min) could be analyzed on-line without breaking the MS vacuum. One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in equine urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Thermospray interface ===\nThe thermospray (TSP) interface was developed in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces. The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion-molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of eluate from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS vacuum system. TSP was also more suitable for LC-MS applications involving [[High-performance liquid chromatography|reversed phase liquid chromatography]] (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the mechanical complexity of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal LC-MS interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the analysis of [[drug]]s, metabolites, conjugates, [[nucleoside]]s, [[peptide]]s, [[natural product]]s, and [[pesticide]]s. The introduction of TSP marked a significant improvement for LC-MS systems and was the most widely applied interface until the beginning of the 1990s, when it began to be replaced by interfaces involving atmospheric pressure ionization (API).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== FAB Based Interfaces ===\nThe frit [[Fast atom bombardment|FAB]] and continuous flow-FAB (CF-FAB) interfaces were developed in 1985 and 1986 respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Both interfaces were similar, but they differed in that the first used a porous frit probe as connecting channel, while CF-FAB used a probe tip. From these, the CF-FAB was more successful as a LC-MS interface and was useful to analyze non-volatile and thermally labile compounds. In these interfaces, the LC effluent passed through the frit or CF-FAB channels to form a uniform liquid film at the tip. There, the liquid was bombarded with ion beams or high energy atoms (fast atom). For stable operation, the FAB based interfaces were able to handle liquid flow rates of only 1\u201315 \u03bcl and were also restricted to microbore and capillary columns. In order to be used in FAB MS ionization sources, the analytes of interest should be mixed with a matrix (e.g., glycerol) that could be added before or after the separation in the LC column. FAB based interfaces were extensively used to characterize peptides, but lost applicability with the advent of [[Electrospray ionization|electrospray]] based interfaces in 1988.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Liquid chromatography==\n[[File:Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometer.png|thumb|550x550px|Diagram of an LC-MS system]]\n{{main|High-performance liquid chromatography}}\n\nLiquid chromatography is a method of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC can be divided into five categories, i.e., [[adsorption chromatography]], [[partition chromatography]], [[Ion Exchange Chromatography|ion-exchange chromatography]], [[size-exclusion chromatography]], and [[affinity chromatography]]. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C<sub>18</sub>) to the surface of irregularly or spherically shaped 5 \u03bcm diameter silica particles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn HPLC, typically 20 \u03bcl of the sample of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction. The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated [[sorption]] and [[desorption]] steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed.<ref name=\":3\" /> The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components of the sample will flow out of the column at different times.<ref name=\":2\" /> The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns are 100\u2013300&nbsp;mm long with outer diameter of 6.4&nbsp;mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0'''\u2013'''4.6&nbsp;mm. For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30\u201350&nbsp;mm) with 3\u20135 \u03bcm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrow bore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate).<ref name=\":3\" /> In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, [[ultra performance liquid chromatography]] (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with smaller silica particles (~1.7 \u03bcm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Mass spectrometry==\n[[File:Liquid chromatography MS spectrum 3D analysis.png|LC-MS Spectrum of each resolved peak|thumb|450x450px]]\n{{main|Mass spectrometry}}\n\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio (''m/z)'' of charged particles (ions). Although there are many different kinds of mass spectrometers, all of them make use of electric or magnetic fields to manipulate the motion of ions produced from an analyte of interest and determine their ''m/z.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Biophysics - Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16712-6|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-642-16711-9|last1 = Roberts|first1 = Gordon}}</ref> The basic components of a mass spectrometer are the [[ion source]], the [[mass analyzer]], the detector, and the data and vacuum systems. The ion source is where the components of a sample introduced in a MS system are ionized by means of [[electron beams]], photon beams ([[UV light]]s), [[laser]] beams or [[corona discharge]]. In the case of electrospray ionization, the ion source moves ions that exist in liquid solution into the gas phase. The ion source converts and fragments the neutral sample molecules into gas-phase ions that are sent to the mass analyzer. While the mass analyzer applies the electric and magnetic fields to sort the ions by their masses, the detector measures and amplifies the ion current to calculate the abundances of each mass-resolved ion. In order to generate a [[mass spectrum]] that a human eye can easily recognize, the data system records, processes, stores, and displays data in a computer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[mass spectrum]] can be used to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample.<ref name=\":0\" /> MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10<sup>\u22122</sup> to 1.33 * 10<sup>\u22126</sup> pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Drug Metabolism Handbook|last=Sharp|first=Thomas R.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470439265|editor-last=Nassar|editor-first=Ala F.|pages=167\u2013227|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470439265.ch8|editor-last2=Collegiateessor|editor-first2=Paul F.

To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages.

The liquid from the LC system is pumped through a capillary and there is also nebulization at the tip, where a corona discharge takes place. First, the ionizing gas surrounding the interface and the mobile phase solvent are subject to chemical ionization at the ion source. Later, these ions react with the analyte and transfer their charge. The sample ions then pass through small orifice skimmers by means of or ion-focusing lenses. Once inside the high vacuum region, the ions are subject to mass analysis.

In the direct-APPI mode, singly charged analyte molecular ions are formed by absorption of a photon and ejection of an electron. In the dopant-APPI mode, an easily ionizable compound (Dopant) is added to the mobile phase or the nebulizing gas to promote a reaction of charge-exchange between the dopant molecular ion and the analyte.

Coupled chromatography - [[Mass spectrometry|MS]] systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of each technique are enhanced synergistically. While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass spectrometry provides structural identity of the individual components with high molecular specificity and detection sensitivity. This tandem technique can be used to analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, LC-MS may be applied in a wide range of sectors including [[biotechnology]], environment monitoring, [[food processing]], and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[agrochemical]], and [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] industries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Recent Advances in Redox Active Plant and Microbial Products|last=Chaimbault|first=Patrick|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401789523|editor-last=Jacob|editor-first=Claus|pages=31\u201394|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-8953-0_3|editor-last2=Kirsch|editor-first2=Gilbert|editor-last3=Slusarenko|editor-first3=Alan|editor-last4=Winyard|editor-first4=Paul G.|editor-last5=Burkholz|editor-first5=Torsten|chapter = The Modern Art of Identification of Natural Substances in Whole Plants}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Contemporary Mass Spectrometry|last=Dass|first=Chhabil|date=2007-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470118498|pages=151\u2013194|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470118498.ch5|chapter = Hyphenated Separation Techniques}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers the separated components from the LC column into the MS ion source.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pitt|first=James J|date=2017-03-12|title=Principles and Applications of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry in Clinical Biochemistry|journal=The Clinical Biochemist Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=19\u201334|issn=0159-8090|pmc=2643089|pmid=19224008}}</ref> The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under high vacuum (around 10<sup>\u22126</sup> torr / 10<sup>\u22127</sup> \"Hg). Thus, it is not possible to directly pump the [[Elution|eluate]] from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that  transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the chemical identity of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), [[Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization|atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI), and [[Photoionization|atmospheric pressure photo-ionization]] (APPI).These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History of LC-MS ==\nThe coupling of chromatography with MS is a well developed chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. [[Gas chromatography]] (GC) - MS was originally introduced in 1952, when A.T. James and A.J.P Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=A. T.|last2=Martin|first2=A. J.

Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than LC-MS and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s.<ref name=\":1\" /> The development of LC-MS systems took longer than GC-MS and was directly related to the development of proper interfaces. V.L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of LC-MS in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tal'roze|first=V.L.|last2=Gorodetskii|first2=I.G.|last3=Zolotoy|first3=N.B|last4=Karpov|first4=G.V.|last5=Skurat|first5=V.E.|last6=Maslennikova|first6=V.Ya.|year=1978|title=Capillary system for continuous introducing of volatile liquids into analytical MS and its application|url=|journal=Adv. Mass Spectrom|volume=7|pages=858|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" /> A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for LC-MS had the same analysis capabilities of [[Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary was one of the main issues. Within the first years of development of LC-MS, on-line and off-line  alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes. Off-line analyte treatment process was  time consuming and there was an inherent risk of sample contamination. Rapidly, it was realized that the analysis of complex mixtures would require the development of a fully automated on-line coupling solution in LC-MS.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Third Edition|last=Niessen|first=Wilfried M.

This interface  consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting  the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and [[Fast atom bombardment|fast-atom bombardment]] (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were [[Sector mass spectrometer|magnetic sector]] and [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadropole]] instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied in the analysis of drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Liquid Chromatography \u2013 Mass Spectrometry: An Introduction|last=Ardrey|first=Robert E.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470867297|pages=1\u20135|language=en|doi=10.1002/0470867299.ch1|chapter = Introduction|series = Analytical Techniques in the Sciences (AnTS)}}</ref>\n\n=== Direct liquid introduction interface ===\nThe direct liquid introduction (DLI) interface was developed in 1980. This interface was thought as a solution to the evaporation of liquid inside the capillary inlet interface. In DLI, a nebulizer was used to disintegrate part of the effluent coming from the column. A small diaphragm was used to form a liquid jet composed of small droplets that were subsequently dried in a desolvation chamber. A microbore capillary column was used to transfer the nebulized liquid product to the MS ion source. The analytes were ionized using a solvent assisted chemical ionization source, where the LC solvents acted as reagent gases. To use this interface, it was necessary to split the flow coming out of the LC column because only a small portion of the effluent (10 to 50 \u03bcl/min out of 1 ml/min) could be  analyzed on-line without breaking the MS vacuum. One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in equine urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Thermospray interface ===\nThe thermospray (TSP) interface was developed in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces. The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion-molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of eluate from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS vacuum system. TSP was also more suitable for LC-MS applications involving [[High-performance liquid chromatography|reversed phase liquid chromatography]] (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the mechanical complexity of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal LC-MS interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the  analysis of [[drug]]s, metabolites, conjugates, [[nucleoside]]s, [[peptide]]s, [[natural product]]s, and [[pesticide]]s. The introduction of TSP marked a significant improvement for LC-MS systems and was the most widely applied interface until the beginning of the 1990s, when it began to be replaced by interfaces involving atmospheric pressure ionization (API).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== FAB Based Interfaces ===\nThe frit [[Fast atom bombardment|FAB]] and continuous flow-FAB (CF-FAB) interfaces were developed in 1985 and 1986 respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Both interfaces were similar, but they differed in that the first used a porous frit probe as connecting channel, while CF-FAB used a probe tip. From these, the CF-FAB was more successful as a  LC-MS interface and was useful to analyze non-volatile and thermally labile compounds. In these interfaces, the LC effluent passed through the frit or CF-FAB channels to form a uniform liquid film at the tip. There, the liquid was bombarded with ion beams or high energy atoms (fast atom). For stable operation, the FAB based interfaces were able to handle liquid flow rates of only 1-15 \u03bcl and were also restricted to microbore and capillary columns. In order to be used in FAB MS ionization sources, the analytes of interest should be mixed with a matrix (e.g., glycerol) that could be added before or after the separation in the LC column. FAB based interfaces were extensively used to characterize peptides, but lost applicability with the advent of [[Electrospray ionization|electrospray]] based interfaces in 1988.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Liquid chromatography==\n[[File:Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometer.png|thumb|550x550px|Diagram of an LC-MS system]]\n{{main|High-performance liquid chromatography}}\n\nLiquid chromatography is a method of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC can be divided into five categories, i.e., [[adsorption chromatography]], [[partition chromatography]], [[Ion Exchange Chromatography|ion-exchange chromatography]], [[size-exclusion chromatography]], and [[affinity chromatography]]. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase.  In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C<sub>18</sub>) to the surface of  irregularly or spherically shaped 5 \u03bcm diameter silica particles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn HPLC, typically 20 \u03bcl of the sample of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction. The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated [[sorption]] and [[desorption]] steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed.<ref name=\":3\" /> The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components of the sample will flow out of the column at different times.<ref name=\":2\" /> The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns  are 100\u2013300&nbsp;mm long with outer diameter of 6.4&nbsp;mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6&nbsp;mm.  For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30\u201350&nbsp;mm) with 3-5 \u03bcm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrow bore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate).<ref name=\":3\" />  In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, [[ultra performance liquid chromatography]] (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with  smaller silica particles (~1.7 \u03bcm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Mass spectrometry==\n[[File:Liquid chromatography MS spectrum 3D analysis.png|LC-MS Spectrum of each resolved peak|thumb|450x450px]]\n{{main|Mass spectrometry}}\n\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio (''m/z)'' of charged particles (ions).

The ion source is where the components of a sample introduced in a MS system are ionized by means of [[electron beams]], photon beams ([[UV light]]s), [[laser]] beams or [[corona discharge]]. In the case of electrospray ionization, the ion source moves ions that exist in liquid solution into the gas phase. The ion source converts and fragments the neutral sample molecules into gas-phase ions that are sent to the mass analyzer. While the mass analyzer applies the electric and magnetic fields to sort the ions by their masses, the detector measures and amplifies the ion current  to calculate the abundances of each mass-resolved ion. In order to generate a [[mass spectrum]] that a human eye can easily recognize, the data system records, processes, stores, and displays data in a computer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[mass spectrum]] can be used to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample.<ref name=\":0\" /> MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10<sup>\u22122</sup> to 1.33 * 10<sup>\u22126</sup> pascal).

The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized at the tip of the capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged.<ref name=\":1\" /> The use of 1\u20133&nbsp;mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation  is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 \u03bcl/min range.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ===\n{{Main|Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization|l1=Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization}}\n\nThe development of the APCI interface for LC-MS started with Horning and collaborators in the early 1973.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horning|first=E.

These compounds are not well ionized using ESI. In addition, APCI can also handle mobile phase streams containing  buffering agents. The liquid from the LC system is pumped through a capillary and there is also nebulization at the tip, where a corona discharge takes place. First, the ionizing gas surrounding the interface and the mobile phase solvent are subject to chemical ionization at the ion source. Later, these ions react with the analyte and transfer their charge. The sample ions then pass through small orifice skimmers by means of or ion-focusing lenses. Once inside the high vacuum region, the ions are subject to mass analysis. This interface can be operated in positive and negative charge modes and singly-charged ions are mainly produced.<ref name=\":1\" /> APCI ion source can also handle flow rates between  500 and 2000 \u03bcl/min and it can be directly connected to conventional 4.6&nbsp;mm ID columns.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI) ===\nThe APPI interface for LC-MS was developed simultaneously by Bruins and Syage in 2000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robb|first=null|last2=Covey|first2=null|last3=Bruins|first3=null|date=2000-08-01|title=Atmospheric pressure photoionization: an ionization method for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=72|issue=15|pages=3653\u20133659|issn=1520-6882|pmid=10952556|doi=10.1021/ac0001636}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" />  APPI is another LC-MS ion source/ interface for the analysis of neutral compounds that cannot be ionized using ESI.<ref name=\":1\" /> This interface is similar to the APCI ion source, but instead of a corona discharge, the ionization occurs by using photons coming from a discharge lamp. In the direct-APPI mode, singly charged analyte molecular ions are formed by absorption of a photon and ejection of an electron. In the dopant-APPI mode, an easily ionizable compound (Dopant) is added to the mobile phase or the nebulizing gas to promote a reaction of charge-exchange between the dopant molecular ion and the analyte. The ionized sample is later transferred to the mass analyzer at high vacuum as it passes through small orifice skimmers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Applications==\nThe coupling of MS with LC systems is attractive because liquid chromatography can separate delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition needs to be well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Further, LC-MS has applications in volatile explosive residue analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Widmer|first=Leo|last2=Watson|first2=Stuart|last3=Schlatter|first3=Konrad|last4=Crowson|first4=Andrew|date=2002|title=Development of an LC/MS method for the trace analysis of triacetone triperoxide (TATP)|journal=The Analyst|volume=127|issue=12|pages=1627\u20131632|doi=10.1039/b208350g|pmid=12537371|issn=0003-2654}}</ref>  Nowadays, LC-MS has become one of the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally labile and GC-MS cannot process these samples.{{Citation needed|date = February 2020|reason= Broad statement}} As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for [[proteomics]] and pharmaceutical laboratories.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Other important applications of LC-MS include the analysis of food, [[pesticide]]s, and [[plant phenols]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nLC-MS is widely used in the field of [[bioanalysis]] and is specially involved in [[pharmacokinetic]] studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of [[Tandem mass spectrometry|tandem MS-MS]], where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or [[Ion Suppression in LC-MS|ion suppression]], the LC separation can be quite quick.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_ttxCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=Samples+of+complex+biological+fluids+like+human+serum+may+be+run+in+a+modern+LC-MS/MS+system+and+result+in+over+1000+proteins+being+identified,+provided+that+the+sample+was+first+separated+on+an+SDS-PAGE+gel+or+HPLC-SCX#v=onepage&q=Samples%20of%20complex%20biological%20fluids%20like%20human%20serum%20may%20be%20run%20in%20a%20modern%20LC-MS/MS%20system%20and%20result%20in%20over%201000%20proteins%20being%20identified,%20provided%20that%20the%20sample%20was%20first%20separated%20on%20an%20SDS-PAGE%20gel%20or%20HPLC-SCX&f=false|title=Phenotyping Crop Plants for Physiological and Biochemical Traits|last=Sudhakar|first=P.|last2=Latha|first2=P.|last3=Reddy|first3=P.

Moses is first mentioned in 1549 as an envoy of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] [[Patriarch of Antioch]], Ignatius Abdullah I Stephan, to [[Rome]] to seek the means to print Syriac copies of the [[New Testament]]. His mission also included negotiations of unity with the [[Catholic Church]] in anticipation of the Patriarch's arrival.\n\nWhilst in Rome, Moses stayed in the monastery of [[St Stephen of the Abyssinians]] where [[Johannes Potken]] had printed the first [[Ge'ez]] book, ''Psalterium David et Cantica aliqu''. Here he printed a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscript with the assistance of the Cardinals [[Pope Marcellus II|Marcello Cervini]], [[Reginald Pole]] and [[Jean du Bellay]]. However the manuscript produced was defective as the printers did not understand the language.\n\nIn 1550, Moses travelled to [[Venice]] to meet [[Guillaume Postel]] to promote the idea of printing a Syriac copy of the New Testament which Postel had been working on since 1537. Despite this Postel could not help print it as he did not have the characters to print in Syriac.\n\nIn 1552, Moses then returned to Rome where he taught Syriac to [[Andreas Masius]] and [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]] among others. Upon the advice of Masius, he left Rome in the company of Cardinal Pole as he was returning to [[Kingdom of England|England]], to meet Johann Jacob Fugger in [[Augsburg]]. However, whilst staying in [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]] he met [[Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter]], then chancellor of the Austrian lands. Both sharing the same goals of printing a Syriac copy of the New Testament, Widmanstetter travelled with Moses to [[Vienna]] where they convinced [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] to fund their project. Thus one thousand copies of the Syriac version of the New Testament was printed in 1555 and Moses himself received half of which to distribute in the East.\n\nMoses remained in Europe until 1562 before returning to the East; however before departing he sold 250 copies on the European market. In 1578, he is mentioned returning to Rome as a bishop accompanied by the deposed patriarch [[Ignatius Nemet Allah I]]. In 1581, Moses was appointed Professor of Syriac at the [[College of the Neophytes]].\n\nMushe of Mardin (16th cent.) [Syr. Orth.]\nPriest, scribe, and bp. A native of the village of Q\u0101luq, in the region of \u1e62awro, near Mardin, Mushe was sent by Patr. \u02bfAbdull\u0101h I bar S\u1e6dephanos to Rome, where he arrived with a few mss. in or shortly before 1549. The aim of the mission was to search for Syriac printed books or for opportunities to produce them. Whether Mushe was additionally entrusted with the delicate task of improving relations between the Syr. Orth and the Roman Catholic Church remains disputed. Mushe lived in Rome and traveled through Europe until some time after 1556.\n\nIn Rome, he established contacts with some of the earliest Western scholars interested in Syriac. Among them were Guillaume Postel, Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, and Andreas Masius. He collaborated with Widmanstetter in the publication of the first edition of the Syriac NT, which appeared in Vienna in 1555 and whose Syriac typeface derived from Mushe's handwriting. Mushe served as Masius's Syriac teacher in Rome, and the latter frequently consulted him, in particular while he was preparing his Syrorum Peculium, a Syriac glossary that was included in vol. 6 of the Antwerp Polyglot (1571). Mushe and Masius corresponded in Syriac; a number of letters, belonging to the period 1553\u201355, are preserved. Masius also translated into Latin a profession of faith that Mushe is said to have made in 1552 and which Masius included in one of his later publications; its exact status remains unclear.\n\nDuring his time in Europe, Mushe copied many Syriac mss. Several of these are extant, including the remarkable ms. London, Brit. Libr. Harley 5512, which contains parts of the Roman Missal in Latin, written in Ser\u1e6do script, along with three Syriac Anaphoras. Mushe wrote it for the bp. of the Abyssinian Convent (San Stefano) in Rome, where he often resided, and it shows his interest in, and familiarity with, the Catholic liturgy.\n\nAfter 1556 Mushe returned to the Middle East, where he copied some further mss. (among them Michael Rabo's Chronicle, probably from the author's autograph) and where the (solely honorific?) title of metropolitan bp. was conferred on him. He returned to Rome, probably in the company of Patr. Ni\u02bfmatull\u0101h, following the latter's abdication, in 1578. In Rome he copied and annotated several more Syriac and Arabic mss. He died in or shortly after 1592, possibly in Rome.\n\nhttps://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mushe-of-Mardin== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{reflist|group=Wikipedia}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mardin, Moses of}}\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:1592 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century births]]\n[[Category:Tur Abdin]]\n[[Category:Syriac Orthodox Church bishops]]\n[[Category:16th-century Oriental Orthodox bishops]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox Christian leader\n| type        = Bishop\n| name        = Moses of Mardin\n| title       =\n| alt         = \n| church      = [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]\n| archdiocese = \n| diocese     = \n| see         = \n| term        = \n| predecessor = \n| successor   = \n<!--   Orders   -->\n| consecration     = \n| consecrated_by = \n| rank           = [[Bishop]]\n<!--   Personal details   -->\n| birth_date    = \n| birth_place   = Qaluq, [[Tur Abdin]]\n| death_date    = 1592\n| death_place   = \n| previous_post = [[Priest]]\n}}\n'''Moses of Mardin''' ([[Latin]]: ''Moses Mardenus'') was a [[Syriac Orthodox]] priest and bishop who played a significant role in printing the first Syriac bible and served as perhaps the first Syriac teacher/scholar in Europe.\n\n==Biography==\nMoses was born in the village of Qaluq near [[Mardin]] in the [[Tur Abdin]] region.
