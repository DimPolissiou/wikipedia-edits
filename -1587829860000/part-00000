He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977, and then as the \"[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader]]\" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].\n\n<!--Early life and the republic--> \nBorn near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments\u2014particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Egypt\u2014he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted \"[[Islamic socialism]]\". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a \"[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]\" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.\n\n<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (\"state of the masses\") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and United Nations\u2013imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic [[privatization]], rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]], and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.\n\n<!--Legacy and assessment:-->\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab\u2014and then African\u2014unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse. He was condemned by many as a dictator whose authoritarian administration violated [[Human rights in Libya|human rights]] and financed global [[terrorism]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: to 1950===\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi<ref name=\"iccwarrant\">{{cite web |title=The Prosecutor v.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977, and then as the \"[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader]]\" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].\n\n<!--Early life and the republic--> \nBorn near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments\u2014particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Egypt\u2014he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted \"[[Islamic socialism]]\". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a \"[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]\" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.\n\n<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (\"state of the masses\") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and United Nations\u2013imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic [[privatization]], rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]], and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.\n\n<!--Legacy and assessment:-->\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab\u2014and then African\u2014unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse.

Barnes research spans 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted in the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging on the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in [[spatial memory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the [[hippocampus]]. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition. In addition, older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated. This finding relates to the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that all mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding suggests that tall mammals use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual reality experience. However, due to variable hippocampus size, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest [[hippocampus]] and thus use 40% of their [[hippocampus]] neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampus and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest [[hippocampus]] and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. These functions are mediated by the activity of the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]]. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]]. Attentional monitoring and updating allow for behavior changes with corresponding rule changes. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct choice initially; however, when the correct choice changes to the second option, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior in order to choose correctly. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error, which helps associate the right choice with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Suggesting, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with this interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age. Thus, Barnes and her team suggest that changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]] can result from aging but different sub-regions within it show different patterns of aging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking in space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less discrete activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated network. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

Barnes research spans 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted in the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging on the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in [[spatial memory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the [[hippocampus]]. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition. In addition, older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated. This finding relates to the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that all mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding suggests that tall mammals use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual reality experience. However, due to variable hippocampus size, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest [[hippocampus]] and thus use 40% of their [[hippocampus]] neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampus and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest [[hippocampus]] and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. These functions are mediated by the activity of the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]]. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]]. Attentional monitoring and updating allow for behavior changes with corresponding rule changes. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct choice initially; however, when the correct choice changes to the second option, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior in order to choose correctly. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error, which helps associate the right choice with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Suggesting, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with this interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age. Thus, Barnes and her team suggest that changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]] can result from aging but different sub-regions within it show different patterns of aging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking in space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less discrete activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated network. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

While it is a low floor [[tram]], it is also capable of being used upon the [[National Rail]] network; the Class 399 is the first [[tram-train]] to see operational use in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn 2013, an order was placed with Vossloh for the construction of a batch of nine tram-trains for Supertram. It operates as a pioneering tram-train hybrid vehicle as part of an initial [[Pilot experiment|pilot]] of the operation of such vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsuk-approves-tram-train-pilot-south-yorkshire/ |title=UK approves Tram Train pilot for South Yorkshire |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 May 2012 |website=railway-technology.com |publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The launch of live services using the Class 399 was repeatedly delayed, reportedly due to planning and development-related difficulty experienced by [[Network Rail]], who were responsible for the installation of additional track and other infrastructure-related changes to accommodate the tram-trains upon the heavy rail network, as well as a necessary full track replacement programme performed by Supertram.\n\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced live testing on the Supertram network. On 14 September 2017, the first entered passenger service, but the type was initially restricted to only some sections of Supertram's network as further work was still required on other parts, including Network Rail lines. Full service began on 25 October 2018. The results of the trials may become a decisive factor on the adoption of tram-train technology at various other sites across the country.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Class 399 at Cathedral tram stop.jpg|thumb|399201 at [[Cathedral tram stop]] in January 2020]]\n===Background===\nIn 2008, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced plans to operate a trial [[tram-train]] service using the [[Penistone line]] in [[South Yorkshire]]. As initially envisioned, the trial was to function as two-year pilot programme, as the service would be the first use of combined tram-train operations anywhere in the UK.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The scheme was jointly delivered by the DfT, [[Sheffield Supertram]], [[Network Rail]], [[Northern Rail]] and the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE). The adoption of tram-trains would allow Supertram services to travel on the national rail network, which had the advantages of opening up new routes, integrating multiple transit networks together, and potential for further expansion.<ref name = \"rail eng15\">Johnson, Marc. [https://www.railengineer.uk/2015/12/23/sheffield-tram-train-making-square-pegs-fit/ \"Sheffield tram-train: Making square pegs fit.\"] ''Rail Engineer'', 23 December 2015.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the local impact of the scheme, it has been anticipated that the trial could be invaluable to transport operators through the United Kingdom. Careful scrutiny is to be applied to the service's reliability and popularity; in the long run, the determined level of success could be a decisive factor on the further implementation of tram-train technology across the country.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> According to Rob Carroll, major projects manager at Supertram, the tram-train project team has been approached by multiple organisations, highlighting the interest expressed by representatives of the [[Manchester Metrolink]], transport managers studying options for a rail link to [[Glasgow Airport]], and personnel from [[South Wales]]. The prospect of being able to readily combine heavy and light rail networks together is considered to be an attractive prospect in some cities.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/><ref>Dickins, Sarah.

The revised proposal envisaged the use of the Supertram network, using a new link constructed to connect it to the [[Dearne Valley line]] to [[Rotherham]], that would then allow trams to operate on both [[heavy rail]] and [[light rail]] lines. As part of the project, the line would be electrified, allowing more cost-effective electric vehicles to be procured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8257652.stm |title=City tram-trains trial unveiled  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 September 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> In May 2012, approval for the tram-train trial was granted by the DfT, along with a commitment of \u00a358 million towards the construction of a 400 meter chord to serve as the link between the Network Rail and Supertram networks, as well as the electrification of 8 miles of the route to Rotherham and the purchase of seven new tram-train vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\" />\n\nIn June 2013, [[MACOSA|Vossloh Espa\u00f1a]] was selected to construct the new tram-trains with the first scheduled to be delivered in September 2015.<ref name=\"vossloh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsvossloh-espaa-deliver-seven-tram-trains-sypte-uk |title=Vossloh Espa\u00f1a to deliver seven tram trains to SYPTE in UK|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 June 2013 |website=railway-technology.com|publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> Under Supertram's numbering system, the seven units were numbered as 201-207; however, because part of their operation is on the [[National Rail]] network, they are required to be registered under the [[TOPS]] used for main line rail vehicles, which led them being classified as the Class 399.

A Network Rail spokesman stated at the time that the project would be delayed until 2017 and attributed this to the organisation having to wait for the needed permission of the transport secretary to carry out the construction of new track at Tinsley.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-34473670 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme delayed by year\"] ''BBC News'', 8 October 2015.</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the project was effectively delayed once again when it was announced that a 2017 start date would \"not be possible\".<ref name = \"bbc delaymay16\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-36315711 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train pilot delayed further.\"] ''BBC News'', 18 May 2016.</ref> Speaking at the time, Network Rail referred to the complexity present in elements of the design and planning of the envisioned tram-train operations, and that a thorough review of the programme was in the process of being conducted by the organisation and SYPTE.<ref name = \"bbc delaymay16\"/> Amongst the various changes required in advance of the new unit's operational use, the entirety of the Supertram network had to be re-profiled.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In November 2016, while in the midst of a review of the associated programme of works, it was announced that full tram-train services would commence in summer 2018, having encountered factors which had necessitated yet another delay.<ref name=\"bbc delaynov16\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-38103252 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme delayed further.\"] ''BBC News'', 25 November 2016.</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, a highly-critical parliamentary report on the developing tram-train programme was released.<ref name = \"report 17\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-42354784 \"Scathing report on Sheffield-Rotherham tram-train pilot.\"] ''BBC News'', 15 December 2017.</ref> According to the report, costs had risen to \u00a375.1 million, around five times of the original \u00a315 million budget originally allocated for the programme. It also found there to have been a \"high level of risk and uncertainty\" and \"\"unacceptable cost increases and delays\", while the DfT were criticised for failing to question if the project still offered value for money or fulfilled its goals.<ref name = \"report 17\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe Class 399 is a dedicated tram-train unit. The primary purpose of the type is to operate the tram-train service between Sheffield and Rotherham; as such, it is designed to run on both the National Rail and Supertram networks.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> Each vehicle is composed of three articulated sections, which are fitted with a total of three motorised bogies and one unpowered trailer bogie, complete with a [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. They are bi-directional units, which eliminates any need for turnaround facilities to be installed; rear-view camera displays are also present in the driver\u2019s cab for improved visibility and situational awareness.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nTo suit the two different networks, the Class 399 are dual voltage vehicles, capable of operating on both the 750 V [[OHLE]] of Supertram's network, and the 25 kV OHLE that is the standard on the [[National Rail]] network. Although the route to Rotherham will be electrified to the 750 V standard used on the rest of the Supertram network, the installation of dual voltage capability is to allow the vehicles to be [[future-proof]]ed if the [[Midland Main Line]] north of Sheffield is electrified.<ref name=\"engineer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railengineer.uk/2013/08/15/next-stop-rotherham-sheffields-new-tram-trains/ |title=Next stop Rotherham: Sheffield\u2019s new Tram Trains |last1=O'Connor |first1=Paul |date=15 August 2013 |website=The Rail Engineer |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref><ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The process for switching between the two different power supplies is automated by an integrated Automatic Power Control (APC) system. This system is triggered by a series of [[magnet]]s which have been embedded at key locations on the ground outside of the track, while the two power supplies are intentionally separated a neutral section of track.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In practice, the vehicle travels over the first magnet to trigger the [[circuit breaker]]s to open, after which it coasts through the short neutral section before the new voltage is detected and the circuit breakers are closed again. While the APC provides an automated process for this, there is a manual override allowing the driver to close the circuit breaker if circumstance ever requires this to be done.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nThe Supertram lines and the National Rail network also use vastly different signalling systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> When travelling on the Supertram network, signals are primarily provided to the driver visually; the tram-trains also make use of the same vehicle identification system (VIS) as used by the conventional trams. In addition, for compatibility with running upon the National Rail network, the tram-trains are fitted with [[Train Protection & Warning System]] (TPWS) and [[GSM-R]] equipment.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> While TPWS is to be active during all operations, manual intervention by the driver is required to for the activation of the GSM-R apperatus each time that one of the vehicles enters onto the heavy rail line.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nIn order for the vehicle to be capable of running on both on-street tramways and the National Rail network, the profile of the wheels were required to suit the particularities of the rails on both systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The design team collaborated with the [[University of Huddersfield]], to develop a specially-designed wheel that fits both rail head profiles, which is claimed to reduce the rate of wear and mitigate against the risk of derailment. However, as the wheel profile was non-standard, permission had to be obtained from the [[Rail Safety and Standards Board]] before the new design could be adopted and subject to real-world testing.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> As a result of the vehicles being operated upon a heavy rail line, they are subject to higher [[crashworthiness]] standards than had been imposed upon the [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram|rest of Supertram's fleet]], meaning that these units will be the only ones capable of operating the tram-train service to Rotherham.<ref name=\"vossloh\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welovesheffield.uk/magazine/news/10-sheffield-to-rotherham-tram-train-plans.html |title=Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train plans  |last1=Hargreaves |first1=James |date=13 February 2014 |website=We Love Sheffield |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Supertram 399202 Donetsk.jpg|thumb|Supertram 202 on test at [[Donetsk Way tram stop|Donetsk Way]], April 2017]]\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced active testing on the Supertram network.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> On 14 September 2017, the first Class 399 officially entered passenger service in a ceremony attended by the [[Ministry of Transport|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Paul Maynard]] and various transport officials and representatives from [[Sheffield Children's Hospital]].<ref name = \"tram launch17\">[http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2017/2017-09-14.aspx \"Minister launches first Citylink tram train into service.\"] ''Stagecoach'', 14 September 2017.</ref><ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/light-rail/single-view/view/sheffield-tram-train-enters-service.html \"Sheffield tram-train enters service.\"] ''[[Metro Report International]]'', 15 September 2017.</ref>  399202 was named ''Theo'', after the mascot of the city's children's hospital charity; in addition, tram passengers who travelled over the next two days made donations to the charity in place of the standard fare.<ref name = \"tram launch17\"/>\n\nIn addition to their tram-train functionality, the fleet has also been used to strengthen Supertram's existing assets, which has not been previously expanded since having been originally commissioned in 1992.

While it is a low floor [[tram]], it is also capable of being used upon the [[National Rail]] network; the Class 399 is the first [[tram-train]] to see operational use in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn 2013, an order was placed with Vossloh for the construction of a batch of nine tram-trains for Supertram. It operates as a pioneering tram-train hybrid vehicle as part of an initial [[Pilot experiment|pilot]] of the operation of such vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsuk-approves-tram-train-pilot-south-yorkshire/ |title=UK approves Tram Train pilot for South Yorkshire |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 May 2012 |website=railway-technology.com |publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The launch of live services using the Class 399 was repeatedly delayed, reportedly due to planning and development-related difficulty experienced by [[Network Rail]], who were responsible for the installation of additional track and other infrastructure-related changes to accommodate the tram-trains upon the heavy rail network, as well as a necessary full track replacement programme performed by Supertram.\n\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced live testing on the Supertram network. On 14 September 2017, the first entered passenger service, but the type was initially restricted to only some sections of Supertram's network as further work was still required on other parts, including Network Rail lines. Full service began on 25 October 2018. The results of the trials may become a decisive factor on the adoption of tram-train technology at various other sites across the country.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Class 399 at Cathedral tram stop.jpg|thumb|399201 at [[Cathedral tram stop]] in January 2020]]\n===Background===\nIn 2008, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced plans to operate a trial [[tram-train]] service using the [[Penistone line]] in [[South Yorkshire]]. As initially envisioned, the trial was to function as two-year pilot programme, as the service would be the first use of combined tram-train operations anywhere in the UK.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The scheme was jointly delivered by the DfT, [[Sheffield Supertram]], [[Network Rail]], [[Northern Rail]] and the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE). The adoption of tram-trains would allow Supertram services to travel on the national rail network, which had the advantages of opening up new routes, integrating multiple transit networks together, and potential for further expansion.<ref name = \"rail eng15\">Johnson, Marc. [https://www.railengineer.uk/2015/12/23/sheffield-tram-train-making-square-pegs-fit/ \"Sheffield tram-train: Making square pegs fit.\"] ''Rail Engineer'', 23 December 2015.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the local impact of the scheme, it has been anticipated that the trial could be invaluable to transport operators through the United Kingdom. Careful scrutiny is to be applied to the service's reliability and popularity; in the long run, the determined level of success could be a decisive factor on the further implementation of tram-train technology across the country.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> According to Rob Carroll, major projects manager at Supertram, the tram-train project team has been approached by multiple organisations, highlighting the interest expressed by representatives of the [[Manchester Metrolink]], transport managers studying options for a rail link to [[Glasgow Airport]], and personnel from [[South Wales]]. The prospect of being able to readily combine heavy and light rail networks together is considered to be an attractive prospect in some cities.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/><ref>Dickins, Sarah.

The revised proposal envisaged the use of the Supertram network, using a new link constructed to connect it to the [[Dearne Valley line]] to [[Rotherham]], that would then allow trams to operate on both [[heavy rail]] and [[light rail]] lines. As part of the project, the line would be electrified, allowing more cost-effective electric vehicles to be procured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8257652.stm |title=City tram-trains trial unveiled  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 September 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> In May 2012, approval for the tram-train trial was granted by the DfT, along with a commitment of \u00a358 million towards the construction of a 400 meter chord to serve as the link between the Network Rail and Supertram networks, as well as the electrification of 8 miles of the route to Rotherham and the purchase of seven new tram-train vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\" />\n\nIn June 2013, [[MACOSA|Vossloh Espa\u00f1a]] was selected to construct the new tram-trains with the first scheduled to be delivered in September 2015.<ref name=\"vossloh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsvossloh-espaa-deliver-seven-tram-trains-sypte-uk |title=Vossloh Espa\u00f1a to deliver seven tram trains to SYPTE in UK|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 June 2013 |website=railway-technology.com|publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> Under Supertram's numbering system, the seven units were numbered as 201-207; however, because part of their operation is on the [[National Rail]] network, they are required to be registered under the [[TOPS]] used for main line rail vehicles, which led them being classified as the Class 399.

It also found there to have been a \"high level of risk and uncertainty\" and \"\"unacceptable cost increases and delays\", while the DfT were criticised for failing to question if the project still offered value for money or fulfilled its goals.<ref name = \"report 17\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe Class 399 is a dedicated tram-train unit. The primary purpose of the type is to operate the tram-train service between Sheffield and Rotherham; as such, it is designed to run on both the National Rail and Supertram networks.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> Each vehicle is composed of three articulated sections, which are fitted with a total of three motorised bogies and one unpowered trailer bogie, complete with a [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. They are bi-directional units, which eliminates any need for turnaround facilities to be installed; rear-view camera displays are also present in the driver\u2019s cab for improved visibility and situational awareness.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nTo suit the two different networks, the Class 399 are dual voltage vehicles, capable of operating on both the 750 V [[OHLE]] of Supertram's network, and the 25 kV OHLE that is the standard on the [[National Rail]] network. Although the route to Rotherham will be electrified to the 750 V standard used on the rest of the Supertram network, the installation of dual voltage capability is to allow the vehicles to be [[future-proof]]ed if the [[Midland Main Line]] north of Sheffield is electrified.<ref name=\"engineer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railengineer.uk/2013/08/15/next-stop-rotherham-sheffields-new-tram-trains/ |title=Next stop Rotherham: Sheffield\u2019s new Tram Trains |last1=O'Connor |first1=Paul |date=15 August 2013 |website=The Rail Engineer |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref><ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The process for switching between the two different power supplies is automated by an integrated Automatic Power Control (APC) system. This system is triggered by a series of [[magnet]]s which have been embedded at key locations on the ground outside of the track, while the two power supplies are intentionally separated a neutral section of track.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In practice, the vehicle travels over the first magnet to trigger the [[circuit breaker]]s to open, after which it coasts through the short neutral section before the new voltage is detected and the circuit breakers are closed again. While the APC provides an automated process for this, there is a manual override allowing the driver to close the circuit breaker if circumstance ever requires this to be done.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nThe Supertram lines and the National Rail network also use vastly different signalling systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> When travelling on the Supertram network, signals are primarily provided to the driver visually; the tram-trains also make use of the same vehicle identification system (VIS) as used by the conventional trams. In addition, for compatibility with running upon the National Rail network, the tram-trains are fitted with [[Train Protection & Warning System]] (TPWS) and [[GSM-R]] equipment.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> While TPWS is to be active during all operations, manual intervention by the driver is required to for the activation of the GSM-R apperatus each time that one of the vehicles enters onto the heavy rail line.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nIn order for the vehicle to be capable of running on both on-street tramways and the National Rail network, the profile of the wheels were required to suit the particularities of the rails on both systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The design team collaborated with the [[University of Huddersfield]], to develop a specially-designed wheel that fits both rail head profiles, which is claimed to reduce the rate of wear and mitigate against the risk of derailment. However, as the wheel profile was non-standard, permission had to be obtained from the [[Rail Safety and Standards Board]] before the new design could be adopted and subject to real-world testing.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> As a result of the vehicles being operated upon a heavy rail line, they are subject to higher [[crashworthiness]] standards than had been imposed upon the [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram|rest of Supertram's fleet]], meaning that these units will be the only ones capable of operating the tram-train service to Rotherham.<ref name=\"vossloh\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welovesheffield.uk/magazine/news/10-sheffield-to-rotherham-tram-train-plans.html |title=Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train plans  |last1=Hargreaves |first1=James |date=13 February 2014 |website=We Love Sheffield |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Supertram 399202 Donetsk.jpg|thumb|Supertram 202 on test at [[Donetsk Way tram stop|Donetsk Way]], April 2017]]\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced active testing on the Supertram network.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> On 14 September 2017, the first Class 399 officially entered passenger service in a ceremony attended by the [[Ministry of Transport|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Paul Maynard]] and various transport officials and representatives from [[Sheffield Children's Hospital]].<ref name = \"tram launch17\">[http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2017/2017-09-14.aspx \"Minister launches first Citylink tram train into service.\"] ''Stagecoach'', 14 September 2017.</ref><ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/light-rail/single-view/view/sheffield-tram-train-enters-service.html \"Sheffield tram-train enters service.\"] ''[[Metro Report International]]'', 15 September 2017.</ref>  399202 was named ''Theo'', after the mascot of the city's children's hospital charity; in addition, tram passengers who travelled over the next two days made donations to the charity in place of the standard fare.<ref name = \"tram launch17\"/>\n\nIn addition to their tram-train functionality, the fleet has also been used to strengthen Supertram's existing assets, which has not been previously expanded since having been originally commissioned in 1992.

In September 1969, he teamed with the rhythm section of [[Vanilla Fudge]]: bassist [[Tim Bogert]] and drummer [[Carmine Appice]] (when they were in England to resolve contractual issues), but when Beck fractured his skull in a car accident near Maidstone in December the plan was postponed for two and a half years, during which time Bogert and Appice formed [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]]. Beck later remarked on the 1960s period of his life: \"Everyone thinks of the 1960s as something they really weren't. It was the frustration period of my life.

By April 1971 Beck had completed the line-up of this new group with guitarist/vocalist [[Bobby Tench]], keyboard player [[Max Middleton]] and bassist [[Clive Chaman]].

One, \"I Got to Have a Song\", was the first of four [[Stevie Wonder]] compositions covered by Beck. Shortly after the release of the ''Jeff Beck Group'' album, the band was dissolved and Beck's management put out the statement that: \"The fusion of the musical styles of the various members has been successful within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn't feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought.\"{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=122}}\n\nBeck then started collaborating with bassist [[Tim Bogert]] and drummer [[Carmine Appice]], who became available following the demise of [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]] but continued touring as the Jeff Beck Group in August 1972, to fulfill contractual obligations with his promoter, with a line-up including Bogert, Appice, [[Max Middleton]] and vocalist [[Kim Milford]]. After six appearances Milford was replaced by [[Bobby Tench]], who was flown in from the UK{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=123}} for the ''Arie Crown Theatre'' Chicago performance and the rest of the tour,{{sfn|Joynson|1998|p=415}} which concluded at the [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle, Washington)|Paramount North West Theatre, Seattle]].

Their live album ''[[Live in Japan (Beck, Bogert & Appice album)|Beck, Bogert & Appice Live in Japan]]'', recorded during their 1973 tour of Japan, was not released until February 1975 by Epic/Sony.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter a few months Beck entered Underhill Studio and met with the group [[Upp (band)|Upp]], whom he recruited as backing band for his appearance on the BBC TV programme ''Guitar Workshop'' in August 1974. Beck produced and played on their self-titled debut album and their second album ''This Way Upp'', though his contributions to the second album went uncredited. In October Beck began to record instrumentals at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] with [[Max Middleton]], bassist [[Phil Chen]] and drummer Richard Bailey, using [[George Martin]] as producer and arranger.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nJeff Beck's solo album ''[[Blow by Blow]]'' (March 1975) evolved from these sessions and showcased Beck's technical prowess in jazz-rock. The album reached number four in the charts and is Beck's most commercially successful release. Beck, fastidious about [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] and often dissatisfied with his solos, often returned to AIR Studios until he was satisfied. A couple of months after the sessions had finished producer George Martin received a telephone call from Beck, who wanted to record a solo section again. Bemused, Martin replied: \"I'm sorry, Jeff, but the record is in the shops!\"{{sfn|Foster|Cunningham|2000|pp=13, 119, 120, 315}}\n[[File:Jeff Beck in Amsterdam 1979.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Beck performing in Amsterdam; 1979]]\nBeck put together a live band for a US tour, preceded by a small and unannounced gig at The Newlands Tavern in Peckham, London. He toured through April and May 1975, mostly supporting the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], retaining Max Middleton on keyboards but with a new [[rhythm section]] of bassist [[Wilbur Bascomb]] and noted session drummer [[Bernard Purdie|Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie]].\n\nIn a May 1975 show in Cleveland, Ohio (Music Hall), he became frustrated with an early version of a [[talk box]] he used on his arrangement of the Beatles' \"[[She's a Woman]]\", and after breaking a string, tossed his legendary Yardbirds-era [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar off the stage. He did the same with the talk box and finished the show playing a Les Paul and without the box. During this tour he performed at [[Yuya Uchida (singer)|Yuya Uchida]]'s \"World Rock Festival\", playing a total of eight songs with Purdie. In addition he performed a guitar and drum instrumental with Johnny Yoshinaga and, at the end of the festival, joined in a live jam with bassist [[Felix Pappalardi]] of [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] and vocalist [[Joe Yamanaka|Akira \"Joe\" Yamanaka]] from the [[Flower Travellin' Band]]. Only his set with Purdie was recorded and released.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nHe returned to the studio and recorded ''[[Wired (Jeff Beck album)|Wired]]'' (1976), which paired ex-[[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] drummer and composer [[Narada Michael Walden]] and keyboardist [[Jan Hammer]]. The album used a jazz-rock fusion style, which sounded similar to the work of his two collaborators. To promote the album, Beck joined forces with the [[Jan Hammer|Jan Hammer Group]], playing a show supporting [[Alvin Lee]] at [[The Roundhouse]] in May 1976, before embarking on a seven-month-long world tour. This resulted in the live album ''[[Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live]]'' (1977).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAt this point, Beck was a [[tax exile]] and took up residency in the US, remaining there until his return to the UK in the autumn of 1977. In the spring of 1978, he began rehearsing with ex-[[Return to Forever]] bassist [[Stanley Clarke]] and drummer [[Gerry Brown]] towards a projected appearance at the Knebworth Festival, but this was cancelled after Brown dropped out. Beck toured Japan for three weeks in November 1978 with an ad-hoc group consisting of Clarke and newcomers [[Tony Hymas]] (keyboards) and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) from [[Jack Bruce]]'s band.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nWork then began on a new studio album at [[the Who]]'s Ramport Studios in London and continued sporadically throughout 1979, resulting in ''[[There & Back (Jeff Beck album)|There & Back]]'' in June 1980. It featured three tracks composed and recorded with Jan Hammer, while five were written with Hymas. Stanley Clarke was replaced by [[Mo Foster]] on bass, both on the album and the subsequent tours. Its release was followed by extensive touring in the USA, Japan and the UK.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981 Beck made a series of historic live appearances with his [[Yardbirds]] predecessor [[Eric Clapton]] at the [[Amnesty International]]-sponsored benefit concerts dubbed ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' shows. He appeared with Clapton on \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\", \"Further on up the Road\", and his own arrangement of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\". Beck also featured prominently in an all-star band finale performance of \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\" with Clapton, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Donovan]] and [[Bob Geldof]]. Beck's contributions were seen and heard in the resulting album and film, both of which achieved worldwide success in 1982. Another benefit show, the [[ARMS Charity Concert|ARMS Concert]] for [[multiple sclerosis]] featured a jam with Beck, Eric Clapton and [[Jimmy Page]]. They performed \"[[Tulsa Time]]\" and \"[[Layla]]\".\nIn 1985 Beck released ''[[Flash (Jeff Beck album)|Flash]]'', featuring a variety of vocalists, but most notably former bandmate [[Rod Stewart]] on a rendition of [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s \"[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1d6aAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT151&dq=people+get+ready+beck+stewart+mtv#v=onepage&q=people%20get%20ready%20beck%20stewart%20mtv&f=false | title=The Small Faces & Other Stories| isbn=9780857124517| last1=Schmitt| first1=Roland| date=2011-08-01}}</ref> The aforementioned cover song  was also released as a single which went on to become a hit.

Beck also formed [[the Jeff Beck Group]] and with [[Tim Bogert]] and [[Carmine Appice]], he formed [[Beck, Bogert & Appice]].\n\nMuch of Beck's recorded output has been instrumental, with a focus on innovative sound, and his releases have spanned [[genre]]s ranging from [[blues rock]], [[hard rock]], and an additional blend of guitar-rock and [[electronica]].

The new band performed as \"the Jeff Beck Group\" but had a substantially different sound from the first line-up.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n''[[Rough and Ready (album)|Rough and Ready]]'' (October 1971), the first album they recorded, on which Beck wrote or co-wrote six of the album's seven tracks (the exception being written by Middleton), included elements of soul, rhythm-and-blues and jazz, foreshadowing the direction Beck's music would take later in the decade.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Early Jeff Beck.jpg|thumb|200px|Beck playing in 1973]]\nA second album ''[[Jeff Beck Group (album)|Jeff Beck Group]]'' (July 1972) was recorded at TMI studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] with the same personnel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graves|first=Tom|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jeff-beck-group-mw0000649876|title=Jeff Beck Group Review|website=AllMusic|accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref> Beck employed [[Steve Cropper]] as producer{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=115}} and the album displayed a strong [[Soul Music|soul]] influence, five of the nine tracks being covers of songs by American artists. One, \"I Got to Have a Song\", was the first of four [[Stevie Wonder]] compositions covered by Beck. Shortly after the release of the ''Jeff Beck Group'' album, the band was dissolved and Beck's management put out the statement that: \"The fusion of the musical styles of the various members has been successful within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn't feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought.\"{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=122}}\n\nBeck then started collaborating with bassist [[Tim Bogert]] and drummer [[Carmine Appice]], who became available following the demise of [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]] but continued touring as the Jeff Beck Group in August 1972, to fulfill contractual obligations with his promoter, with a line-up including Bogert, Appice, [[Max Middleton]] and vocalist [[Kim Milford]]. After six appearances Milford was replaced by [[Bobby Tench]], who was flown in from the UK{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=123}} for the ''Arie Crown Theatre'' Chicago performance and the rest of the tour,{{sfn|Joynson|1998|p=415}} which concluded at the [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle, Washington)|Paramount North West Theatre, Seattle]]. After the tour Tench and Middleton left the band and the [[power trio]] [[Beck, Bogert & Appice]] appeared: Appice took on the role of vocalist with Bogert and Beck contributing occasionally.{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=124}}\n\nThey were included on the bill for ''Rock at The Oval'' in September 1972, still as \"the Jeff Beck Group,\" which marked the start of a tour schedule of UK, the Netherlands and Germany. Another U.S. tour began in October 1972, starting at the [[Hollywood Sportatorium]] Florida and concluding on 11 November 1972 at The Warehouse, [[New Orleans]].{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|pp=125\u2013131}} In April 1973 the album ''[[Beck, Bogert & Appice (album)|Beck, Bogert & Appice]]'' was released (on Epic Records). While critics acknowledged the band's instrumental prowess the album was not commercially well received except for its cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s hit \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\".\n\nOn 3 July 1973 Beck joined [[David Bowie]] onstage to perform \"[[The Jean Genie]]\"/\"[[Love Me Do]]\" and \"[[Around and Around]].\" The show was recorded and filmed, but none of the released editions included Beck. During October 1973 Beck recorded tracks for [[Michael Fennelly (musician)|Michael Fennelly]]'s<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p17485|pure_url=yes}}|author=Thomas, Bryan|title=Michael Fennelly|publisher=allmusic.com| accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref> album ''Lane Changer'' and attended sessions with [[Hummingbird (band)|Hummingbird]], a band derived from the Jeff Beck Group, but did not to contribute to their [[eponymous]] first album.{{sfn|Hjort|Hinman|2000|p=146}}\n\nEarly in January 1974 [[Beck, Bogert & Appice]] played at the [[Rainbow Theatre (Finsbury Park)|Rainbow Theatre]], as part of a European tour. The concert was broadcast in full on the US show ''Rock Around the World'' in September of the same year. This last recorded work by the band previewed material intended for a second studio album, included on the bootleg ''At Last Rainbow''. The tracks \"Blues Deluxe\" and \"BBA Boogie\" from this concert were later included on the Jeff Beck compilation ''[[Beckology]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1580|pure_url=yes}}|author=Bruce Eder|title=Beckology| publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=February 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBeck, Bogert & Appice dissolved in April 1974 before their second studio album (produced by Jimmy Miller) was finished. Their live album ''[[Live in Japan (Beck, Bogert & Appice album)|Beck, Bogert & Appice Live in Japan]]'', recorded during their 1973 tour of Japan, was not released until February 1975 by Epic/Sony.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter a few months Beck entered Underhill Studio and met with the group [[Upp (band)|Upp]], whom he recruited as backing band for his appearance on the BBC TV programme ''Guitar Workshop'' in August 1974. Beck produced and played on their self-titled debut album and their second album ''This Way Upp'', though his contributions to the second album went uncredited. In October Beck began to record instrumentals at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] with [[Max Middleton]], bassist [[Phil Chen]] and drummer Richard Bailey, using [[George Martin]] as producer and arranger.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nJeff Beck's solo album ''[[Blow by Blow]]'' (March 1975) evolved from these sessions and showcased Beck's technical prowess in jazz-rock. The album reached number four in the charts and is Beck's most commercially successful release. Beck, fastidious about [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] and often dissatisfied with his solos, often returned to AIR Studios until he was satisfied. A couple of months after the sessions had finished producer George Martin received a telephone call from Beck, who wanted to record a solo section again. Bemused, Martin replied: \"I'm sorry, Jeff, but the record is in the shops!\"{{sfn|Foster|Cunningham|2000|pp=13, 119, 120, 315}}\n[[File:Jeff Beck in Amsterdam 1979.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Beck performing in Amsterdam; 1979]]\nBeck put together a live band for a US tour, preceded by a small and unannounced gig at The Newlands Tavern in Peckham, London. He toured through April and May 1975, mostly supporting the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], retaining Max Middleton on keyboards but with a new [[rhythm section]] of bassist [[Wilbur Bascomb]] and noted session drummer [[Bernard Purdie|Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie]].\n\nIn a May 1975 show in Cleveland, Ohio (Music Hall), he became frustrated with an early version of a [[talk box]] he used on his arrangement of the Beatles' \"[[She's a Woman]]\", and after breaking a string, tossed his legendary Yardbirds-era [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar off the stage. He did the same with the talk box and finished the show playing a Les Paul and without the box. During this tour he performed at [[Yuya Uchida (singer)|Yuya Uchida]]'s \"World Rock Festival\", playing a total of eight songs with Purdie. In addition he performed a guitar and drum instrumental with Johnny Yoshinaga and, at the end of the festival, joined in a live jam with bassist [[Felix Pappalardi]] of [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] and vocalist [[Joe Yamanaka|Akira \"Joe\" Yamanaka]] from the [[Flower Travellin' Band]]. Only his set with Purdie was recorded and released.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nHe returned to the studio and recorded ''[[Wired (Jeff Beck album)|Wired]]'' (1976), which paired ex-[[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] drummer and composer [[Narada Michael Walden]] and keyboardist [[Jan Hammer]]. The album used a jazz-rock fusion style, which sounded similar to the work of his two collaborators. To promote the album, Beck joined forces with the [[Jan Hammer|Jan Hammer Group]], playing a show supporting [[Alvin Lee]] at [[The Roundhouse]] in May 1976, before embarking on a seven-month-long world tour. This resulted in the live album ''[[Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live]]'' (1977).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAt this point, Beck was a [[tax exile]] and took up residency in the US, remaining there until his return to the UK in the autumn of 1977. In the spring of 1978, he began rehearsing with ex-[[Return to Forever]] bassist [[Stanley Clarke]] and drummer [[Gerry Brown]] towards a projected appearance at the Knebworth Festival, but this was cancelled after Brown dropped out. Beck toured Japan for three weeks in November 1978 with an ad-hoc group consisting of Clarke and newcomers [[Tony Hymas]] (keyboards) and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) from [[Jack Bruce]]'s band.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nWork then began on a new studio album at [[the Who]]'s Ramport Studios in London and continued sporadically throughout 1979, resulting in ''[[There & Back (Jeff Beck album)|There & Back]]'' in June 1980. It featured three tracks composed and recorded with Jan Hammer, while five were written with Hymas. Stanley Clarke was replaced by [[Mo Foster]] on bass, both on the album and the subsequent tours. Its release was followed by extensive touring in the USA, Japan and the UK.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981 Beck made a series of historic live appearances with his [[Yardbirds]] predecessor [[Eric Clapton]] at the [[Amnesty International]]-sponsored benefit concerts dubbed ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' shows. He appeared with Clapton on \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\", \"Further on up the Road\", and his own arrangement of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\". Beck also featured prominently in an all-star band finale performance of \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\" with Clapton, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Donovan]] and [[Bob Geldof]]. Beck's contributions were seen and heard in the resulting album and film, both of which achieved worldwide success in 1982. Another benefit show, the [[ARMS Charity Concert|ARMS Concert]] for [[multiple sclerosis]] featured a jam with Beck, Eric Clapton and [[Jimmy Page]]. They performed \"[[Tulsa Time]]\" and \"[[Layla]]\".\nIn 1985 Beck released ''[[Flash (Jeff Beck album)|Flash]]'', featuring a variety of vocalists, but most notably former bandmate [[Rod Stewart]] on a rendition of [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s \"[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1d6aAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT151&dq=people+get+ready+beck+stewart+mtv#v=onepage&q=people%20get%20ready%20beck%20stewart%20mtv&f=false | title=The Small Faces & Other Stories| isbn=9780857124517| last1=Schmitt| first1=Roland| date=2011-08-01}}</ref> The aforementioned cover song  was also released as a single which went on to become a hit.

It was only his third album to be released in the 1980s.

This was the first game in the newly renovated Commonwealth Stadium.  The $120 million renovation includes player amenities such as a recruiting room and patio atop a tunnel leading to a new synthetic turf field. The Wildcats initially gave a sellout crowd of 62,933 something to feel good about on the field and in their seats before things turned sour.\n\nStanley \"Boom\" Williams' ran for a 75-yard TD on the game's first play. Williams' speed helped the Wildcats deliver just 16 seconds in. Last year's team rushing leader blew through a big hole up the middle and off for a big TD that brought a roar from the packed house before they got comfortable in their seats. He finished with 135 yards on 10 carries.\n\nPatrick Towles' five-yard touchdown pass to Blake Bone provided a 33\u201310 lead late in the third quarter. But Austin MacGinnis' missed extra point opened the door for the Ragin' Cajuns to rally with TD runs of 56 and 26 yards by Torrey Pierce and a 23-yarder by Jalen Nixon.\n\nElijah McGuire's game-tying two point conversion run with 7:36 left created more anxiety, especially for Kentucky when Towles fumbled a fourth-and-1 snap at Louisiana's 49. The junior somehow recovered the ball for a two-yard gain to extend the drive.  Five plays later Horton's 12-yard run with 57 seconds remaining put Kentucky ahead for good.\n\nJosh Forrest intercepted Brooks Haack's Hail Mary pass as time expired to preserve Kentucky's narrow win on a wild but long night that included a faulty game clock and even lightning in the near distance along with the drone crash.\n\nTowles passed for 257 yards and TDs of 35 yards to Garrett Johnson, 37 to Jeff Badet and Bone.\n\n====At South Carolina====\n{{See also|2015 South Carolina Gamecocks football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kentucky Wildcats vs South Carolina Gamecocks \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 12, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road='''Kentucky'''\n|R1=14|R2=10|R3=0|R4=2\n|home=South Carolina\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=9\n|stadium= [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] \u2022 [[Columbia, South Carolina]] \t\n|attendance=82,178\n|weather=75 deg., Clear\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brent Musburger]] (Play-by-play), [[Jesse Palmer]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"USCPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/55edace7e4b06699c1c4ba19 |title=South Carolina pre-game notes |date=September 7, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 7, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"USCStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015 |title=Kentucky vs South Carolina: Scoring Summary |date=September 12, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916012853/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015# |archive-date=September 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Connor Mitch, 1 yard run ([[Elliott Fry]] kick), 12:30 (USC 7\u20130)\n* UK \u2013 Mikel Horton, 8-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (TIED 7\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 2-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (UK 14\u20137)\n;Second Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 29-yard field goal, 7:29 (UK 17\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 0:17 (UK 24\u20137)\n;Third Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 29-yard field goal, 11:13 (UK 24\u201310)\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 6:18 (UK 24\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 14:14 (UK 24\u201316)\n* USC \u2013 Jerrell Adams, 33-yard pass from Perry Orth (Pharoah Cooper rush fumbled), 8:09 (UK 24\u201322)\n* UK \u2013 Denzil Ware, PAT return, 8:09 (UK 26\u201322)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 21/29, 192\n* USC \u2013 Orth \u2013 13/20, 179\n;Top Rushers\n* UK \u2013 B.

Mark Stoops started the week reminding the Wildcats they hadn't had a winning road trip in his three-year tenure. They ended the week celebrating a 26 to 22 road victory at South Carolina on Saturday in front of 82,178 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia. The victory for Kentucky broke a 22-game losing streak in road games with the Wildcats last road win coming at Louisville in September 2010. Kentucky's last SEC road victory was at Georgia in November 2009. UK is now 2\u20130 on the season and starts conference play with a victory for the first time since defeating Arkansas in 2007 in Fayetteville.\n\nHeading into halftime with a 24\u20137 lead, South Carolina scored the first 15 points of the second half, including three Elliott Fry field goals and a 33-yard touchdown pass from Perry Orth, who was playing for injured Gamecock quarterback Conner Mitch, to Jerrell Adams, to cut the UK lead to 24\u201322.  The Gamecocks and head coach Steve Spurrier decided to go for the two-point conversion to try to tie the game before freshman Denzil Ware scooped up a fumble and returned it 98 yards for two points to give UK a 26\u201322 lead with 8:09 to go in the game. After a short drive by the UK offense, South Carolina started another drive on a tired Kentucky defense before another freshman made a big play with rookie cornerback Chris Westry earning his first-career interception to put the Wildcats back in the driver's seat.  The Wildcat offense, who struggled for much of the second half, sealed the victory from there, taking the final 4:32 off the clock, including a key 11-yard quarterback draw by Patrick Towles on third down to drain the Gamecocks of timeouts. Sophomore Stanley \"Boom\" Williams took over from there with a 25-yard rush to end the game.\n\n====Vs.

Trailing 14-3 going into the fourth quarter, the Wildcats made it a one-score game behind two Austin MacGinnis field goals and had the ball twice over the final five minutes in an attempt to score the go-ahead touchdown. Kentucky's final drive of the night began on its own 20-yard line and was dissipated by a Quincy Wilson interception on fourth-and-27 to lift the Gators to the win.\n\nKentucky's defense stymied the Gator attack for the entire second half. Five Wildcats registered six or more tackles on the night, led by Khalid Henderson's nine stops.   UK posted three tackles for a loss and J.D. Harmon picked off a pass in the end zone to halt a Florida drive in the middle of the third quarter that would have pushed UF's lead to three scores. The interception sparked a momentum change in the game as UK would go on to put together back-to-back scoring drives.\n\nUK quarterback Patrick Towles was 8 of 24 on the night with 126 yards and two interceptions. Running back Stanley \"Boom\" Williams rushed 16 times for 80 yards \u2013 snapping his three-game 100-yard rushing streak. Dorian Baker led the receivers with four hauls for 38 yards, including a big fourth-down catch late in the game.  Florida's Will Grier threw for 125 yards and rushed for a team-high 61 yards that included a 1-yard touchdown scamper in the opening quarter.\n\nFollowing Harmon's interception in the third quarter, Towles' 33-yard scramble highlighted a 75-yard drive by the Wildcats to inch closer at 14\u20136 with 14:50 in the fourth. MacGinnis connected on a 22-yard field goal for the Wildcats to make it a one-possession game.  After the UK defense forced a three-and-out, MacGinnis made it a five-point contest with 10:57 to go with a 45-yard field goal. Towles found Jeff Badet for a 45-yard strike down the left sideline to push the Wildcats into field-goal range as the drive's highlight.\n\nFollowing UK's third field goal of the game, Florida managed one first down before being forced to punt with 8:34 remaining. Faced with a third-and-10 from its own 22, Towles found Baker open on the right sideline to keep the drive alive. Williams followed with a 14-yard rush, but the drive stalled at UK's 48. Punter Landon Foster pinned the Gators inside the 20 with 6:10 to go.   The Gators picked up two first downs and killed 3:44 of clock before punting back to the Wildcats, which began the final drive at their own 20. Towles and Baker hooked up for a 20-yard gain on fourth-and-3 at the Kentucky 27 to keep the drive alive.

Towles led UK to its first league victory at the New Commonwealth Stadium and its first win over a ranked opponent since 2010 when Kentucky defeated No. 9 South Carolina. The win over the Tigers signified the first win over a top-25 opponent in the Mark Stoops era.\n\nTowles directed scoring drives in the third and fourth quarters to ignite the offensive effort in the second half. The junior gunslinger found CJ Conrad for a 24-yard strike before connecting with Dorian Baker with less than seven minutes to play to give the Wildcats a 14-point lead it would not relinquish.  Towles had his most consistent game of the season, connecting on 22-of-27 passes for 249 yards with the two touchdown passes. He also added a 14-yard scamper for a score in the opening half.\n\nDefensively, C.J. Johnson paced the Wildcats with 11 tackles, besting his career high by five. Senior linebacker Josh Forrest added nine tackles, while Jason Hatcher posted eight stops to aid the stout defensive effort. Kentucky yielded just 14 points per game through its opening three games against SEC foes.\n\nKentucky, which had not won against Mizzou since the Tigers joined the SEC in 2012, had a number of player milestones as well. With his 6-yard carry with 1:24 remaining in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory, running back JoJo Kemp became the 34th Wildcat to rush for 1,000 yards in a career. The junior led the UK attack on the ground, racking up 66 yards on 13 attempts.  Garrett Johnson led the team in receiving with a season-high 119 yards, including a long of 35 yards that matched his season best. Conrad had a breakout game, not only recording his first career catch but also his first career touchdown with 55 yards of offense through the air. Baker also had a standout game, matching his career high of 51 yards and recording the second touchdown of his career.\n\nFollowing a rocky start to the drive that found the Wildcats in a first-and-29 situation, Towles found Johnson for consecutive 20-plus-yard throws to move the chains and get UK into Missouri territory for the first time in the contest. Kentucky continued to cruise downfield, closing out the quarter on the 14-yard line.  The short break did not derail the Wildcats as Towles used the opening play of the second quarter to dodge and weave through the Tiger defense for a rushing touchdown. That knotted the score at seven apiece.   Much like the start of the game, the second half started slow before Missouri struck late in the third quarter. However, the Tigers were left to settle for a field goal in lieu of a touchdown with 6:04 remaining, with Andrew Baggett sending a 39-yarder through the uprights to give MU a slight 10\u20137 edge.\n\nKemp acted as the catalyst for the team, as three of his carries totaled a combined 37 yards, giving UK a first-and-goal late in the third quarter. Though Kemp moved the offense down the field for the bulk of the drive, it was Conrad who would complete it for the Wildcats, pulling down a perfect 24-yard toss from Towles for the first touchdown of his career. With the addition of the extra point, Kentucky was able to take its first lead of the game with just under two minutes remaining in the third quarter, leading by a count of 14\u201310.\n\n====Vs. <small>(FCS)</small> Eastern Kentucky====\n{{See also|2015 Eastern Kentucky Colonels football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Eastern Kentucky vs Kentucky Wildcats \u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 3, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road=Eastern Kentucky\n|R1=0|R2=6|R3=7|R4=14|R5=0\n|home='''Kentucky'''\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=14|H5=7\n|stadium= [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] \u2022 [[Lexington, Kentucky]] \t\n|attendance=63,380\n|weather=50 deg., Light rain\n|referee= David Smith\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= Mike Couzens (Play-by-play), [[Cole Cubelic]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"EKUPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/56099cd8e4b0f197185e768a |title=Eastern Kentucky pre-game notes |date=September 28, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 21, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"EKUStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015 |title=Eastern Kentucky vs. Kentucky: Scoring Summary |date=October 4, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006094708/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015# |archive-date=October 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 0:51 (UK 7\u20130)\n;Second Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 1-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick failed), 8:49 (UK 7\u20136)\n;Third Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Bennie Coney, 1-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 10:59 (EKU 13\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jeff Badet, 36-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick failed), 8:23 (Tied 13\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Dy'Shawn Mobley, 6-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 12:50 (EKU 20\u201313)\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 15-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick), 7:39 (EKU 27\u201313)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 7-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 4:59 (EKU 27\u201320)\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:52 (Tied 27\u201327)\n;Overtime\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:00 (UK 34\u201327)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* EKU \u2013 Coney \u2013 19/32, 183\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 29/42, 329\n;Top Rushers\n* EKU \u2013 Thomas \u2013 20\u201384\n* UK \u2013 Kemp \u2013 14\u201346\n;Top Receiving\n* EKU \u2013 Mobley \u2013 5\u201350\n* UK \u2013 Baker \u2013 8\u201386\n}}\n\nDespite trailing by 14 points with less than eight minutes in the fourth quarter, the Kentucky football team celebrated its 100th Homecoming anniversary at The New CWS in thrilling fashion, notching a 34-27 comeback overtime victory over in-state foe Eastern Kentucky.\n\nKentucky rallied from a 27\u201313 deficit late in the fourth quarter with back-to-back game-saving drives. Facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of regulation, Patrick Towles stood in the face of a blitz and found Dorian Baker for a 5-yard touchdown to force overtime.\n\nThe duo connected again in overtime with a 3-yard pitch-and-catch to take a 34\u201327 lead. CJ Johnson, who recorded 19 tackles, the most by a defensive lineman in program history, fittingly sealed the outcome with a game-clinching sack.  Eight of Johnson's 19 tackles were solo stops, including a sack and two-and-a-half tackles for loss. Ryan Flannigan was one tackle off his career best with 11 tackles, Josh Forrest recorded double-digit tackles with 10 stops on the night, and Farrington Huguenin blocked a field goal and recovered a fumble.\n\nCoupled with 2014's opening five games, it marks the first time that UK has been 4-1 for two consecutive seasons since 1976\u201377.\n \nTowles rebounded from a two-interception first half to lead the offense for the Wildcats, connecting on 29-of-42 pass attempts for 329 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a rushing score. Towles surpassed the 300-yard mark for the first time this season and the fourth of his career.  The duo of Baker and Blake Bone carried the offense in receiving with 86 and 85 yards, respectively. Both bested their career highs by more than 20 yards each, and Baker's two touchdowns, which included the game-tying and game-winning catches, is a career best for the wide receiver. \n \nThe Wildcats retain an unblemished all-time record against the Colonels and advance to 4\u20131 on the season with the victory.\n\n====Vs.

Auburn earned a 10-point advantage at 30\u201320 with less than eight minutes to play before the Wildcats pulled to within three following a Mikel Horton 1-yard plunge. Kentucky was able to get the ball back with 2:12 remaining, but UK failed to convert on fourth-and-3 from the Auburn 44 to allow the Tigers to clinch the victory.\n\nPatrick Towles posted more than 300 yards of offense for the second consecutive game, racking up 359 yards on 27-of-44 passing with one interception. The junior gunslinger had five 20-plus-yard tosses for the evening, including a pair of throws longer than 35 yards.  Garrett Johnson was Towles' primary target for the long ball, as he posted a career-best 160 yards receiving, including a season-long 39-yard catch that started a drive to help the Wildcats chip away at a 10-point deficit in the second quarter.  Marcus McWilson led the way for the UK defense, tying his career best in total tackles after making 10 stops. Josh Forrest was not far behind with nine tackles, and Jason Hatcher also matched his career mark with seven takedowns.\n\nFor the Tigers, Sean White led the team on 17-of-27 passing for 255 yards, 154 of which went into the hands of Ricardo Louis to lead the team in receiving. On the ground, Peyton Barber rushed for 92 yards and two touchdowns, while Kerryon Johnson added 36 yards and a touchdown for Auburn.\n\nKentucky's running backs paced the team in scoring, with Stanley \"Boom\" Williams returning to action to rush for 113 yards and two touchdowns, including a 60-yard sprint that the sophomore would follow up with the opening touchdown for the Wildcats.

The two teams traded field goals for the remainder of the first half with Marshall Morgan hitting from 22 yards and UK's Austin MacGinnis hitting from 32 yards to cut the UGA halftime lead to 10\u20133. Georgia took control of the game in the third quarter. Kentucky received the opening kickoff of the second half and elected to go for it on fourth-and-short near midfield, but could not covert. The Bulldogs took advantage of the open field, marching 52 yards down the field with Sony Michel's one-yard scoring rush giving UGA a 17\u20133 lead.\n\nThe Bulldogs added to that lead late in the third quarter when Keith Marshall scored on a 10-yard pass from quarterback Greyson Lambert to put UGA up 24\u20133.

Williams had rushes of 66 and 38 yards in his return from an elbow injury. Kentucky (4-6, 2-6 SEC) got on the board first in the game, as Austin MacGinnis hit a 38-yard field goal in the first quarter. But Vandy took its first lead later in that period when Kyle Shurmur hit Kyle Anderton for a four-yard touchdown to give the Commodores a 7\u20133 lead. nIn the second quarter, Kentucky got into the end zone when redshirt freshman quarterback Drew Barker connected with Ryan Timmons on a seven-yard pass to make it 10-7 Kentucky. That marked Barker's first career touchdown pass.\n\nOn Kentucky's next possession, Barker was intercepted by Oren Burks, who returned the pick 30 yards for a touchdown to give Vanderbilt a 14\u201310 lead before the half. Vanderbilt (4-6, 2-4 SEC) tacked on another touchdown before the half when Shurmur connected with Caleb Scott on a 37-yard pass, giving the Commodores a 21\u201310 lead at the break. The second half was largely dominated by the defenses. In fact, the only score after the break came when Kentucky running back Jojo Kemp found the end zone from two yards out with 1:06 left in the third quarter, pulling Kentucky within four points.\n\n====Vs.

In fact, the Wildcats executed so well against Charlotte that topping the effort might be tough.  Jojo Kemp rushed for three touchdowns, Boom Williams ran for two and Kentucky rolled up 544 yards in a 58-10 blowout of Charlotte Saturday night that ended a five-game losing streak.\n\nKemp broke TD runs of 6, 18, and 47 yards, Williams scored from 20 and 53 yards and Sihiem King added a 62-yarder as Kentucky (5-6) rushed for 415 yards, fourth most in school history.  Mike Edwards returned an interception 20 yards for another Wildcats score that handed the 49ers (2-9) their ninth straight loss.  Redshirt freshman Drew Barker added 129 yards passing in his first career start for Kentucky, which earned the first of two wins needed to reach the threshold for bowl eligibility. The Wildcats' defense held Charlotte to just 233 yards, recorded four sacks and forced three turnovers.  Miles Butler kicked field goals of 21, 46 and 32 yards for Kentucky.  Kentucky registered 50 points for the first time since August 2014 against UT Martin, and their 48-point victory margin was its largest since beating UTEP 77\u201317 in 2002.\n\n====Vs.

Kentucky received the opening kickoff and marched down the field, taking a 7\u20130 lead on a one-yard rush by quarterback Drew Barker. After an A.J. Stamps interception, Kentucky took advantage of a short field, going 13 yards in two plays, capped off by a six-yard touchdown rush by Boom Williams to make it 14-0 Kentucky.\n\nOn Louisville's next possession, Kentucky intercepted Louisville quarterback Kyle Bolin for the second time, and Josh Forrest returned the pick 81 yards for a touchdown to make it 21\u20130, still in the first quarter. Louisville got on the board late in the first quarter when backup quarterback [[Lamar Jackson]] rushed 16 yards for a score to make it 21\u20137. In the second quarter, Kentucky added a 20-yard field goal by Miles Butler to take a 24\u20137 lead, which would be the halftime score. Louisville rallied in the second half, eventually taking the lead late in the third quarter, and going on to the victory. Dorian Baker had three catches for 94 yards for Kentucky, while Mikel Horton had 44 yards on the ground to lead the Cats.\n\n==Team statistics==\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"\n|-\n! !!

The Wildcats initially gave a sellout crowd of 62,933 something to feel good about on the field and in their seats before things turned sour.\n\nStanley \"Boom\" Williams' ran for a 75-yard TD on the game's first play. Williams' speed helped the Wildcats deliver just 16 seconds in. Last year's team rushing leader blew through a big hole up the middle and off for a big TD that brought a roar from the packed house before they got comfortable in their seats. He finished with 135 yards on 10 carries.\n\nPatrick Towles' five-yard touchdown pass to Blake Bone provided a 33\u201310 lead late in the third quarter. But Austin MacGinnis' missed extra point opened the door for the Ragin' Cajuns to rally with TD runs of 56 and 26 yards by Torrey Pierce and a 23-yarder by Jalen Nixon.\n\nElijah McGuire's game-tying two point conversion run with 7:36 left created more anxiety, especially for Kentucky when Towles fumbled a fourth-and-1 snap at Louisiana's 49. The junior somehow recovered the ball for a two-yard gain to extend the drive.  Five plays later Horton's 12-yard run with 57 seconds remaining put Kentucky ahead for good.\n\nJosh Forrest intercepted Brooks Haack's Hail Mary pass as time expired to preserve Kentucky's narrow win on a wild but long night that included a faulty game clock and even lightning in the near distance along with the drone crash.\n\nTowles passed for 257 yards and TDs of 35 yards to Garrett Johnson, 37 to Jeff Badet and Bone.\n\n====At South Carolina====\n{{See also|2015 South Carolina Gamecocks football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kentucky Wildcats vs South Carolina Gamecocks \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 12, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road='''Kentucky'''\n|R1=14|R2=10|R3=0|R4=2\n|home=South Carolina\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=9\n|stadium= [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] \u2022 [[Columbia, South Carolina]] \t\n|attendance=82,178\n|weather=75 deg., Clear\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brent Musburger]] (Play-by-play), [[Jesse Palmer]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"USCPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/55edace7e4b06699c1c4ba19 |title=South Carolina pre-game notes |date=September 7, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 7, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"USCStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015 |title=Kentucky vs South Carolina: Scoring Summary |date=September 12, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916012853/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015# |archive-date=September 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Connor Mitch, 1 yard run ([[Elliott Fry]] kick), 12:30 (USC 7\u20130)\n* UK \u2013 Mikel Horton, 8-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (TIED 7\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 2-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (UK 14\u20137)\n;Second Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 29-yard field goal, 7:29 (UK 17\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 0:17 (UK 24\u20137)\n;Third Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 29-yard field goal, 11:13 (UK 24\u201310)\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 6:18 (UK 24\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 14:14 (UK 24\u201316)\n* USC \u2013 Jerrell Adams, 33-yard pass from Perry Orth (Pharoah Cooper rush fumbled), 8:09 (UK 24\u201322)\n* UK \u2013 Denzil Ware, PAT return, 8:09 (UK 26\u201322)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 21/29, 192\n* USC \u2013 Orth \u2013 13/20, 179\n;Top Rushers\n* UK \u2013 B.

Mark Stoops started the week reminding the Wildcats they hadn't had a winning road trip in his three-year tenure. They ended the week celebrating a 26 to 22 road victory at South Carolina on Saturday in front of 82,178 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia. The victory for Kentucky broke a 22-game losing streak in road games with the Wildcats last road win coming at Louisville in September 2010. Kentucky's last SEC road victory was at Georgia in November 2009. UK is now 2\u20130 on the season and starts conference play with a victory for the first time since defeating Arkansas in 2007 in Fayetteville.\n\nHeading into halftime with a 24\u20137 lead, South Carolina scored the first 15 points of the second half, including three Elliott Fry field goals and a 33-yard touchdown pass from Perry Orth, who was playing for injured Gamecock quarterback Conner Mitch, to Jerrell Adams, to cut the UK lead to 24\u201322.  The Gamecocks and head coach Steve Spurrier decided to go for the two-point conversion to try to tie the game before freshman Denzil Ware scooped up a fumble and returned it 98 yards for two points to give UK a 26\u201322 lead with 8:09 to go in the game. After a short drive by the UK offense, South Carolina started another drive on a tired Kentucky defense before another freshman made a big play with rookie cornerback Chris Westry earning his first-career interception to put the Wildcats back in the driver's seat.  The Wildcat offense, who struggled for much of the second half, sealed the victory from there, taking the final 4:32 off the clock, including a key 11-yard quarterback draw by Patrick Towles on third down to drain the Gamecocks of timeouts. Sophomore Stanley \"Boom\" Williams took over from there with a 25-yard rush to end the game.\n\n====Vs.

Trailing 14-3 going into the fourth quarter, the Wildcats made it a one-score game behind two Austin MacGinnis field goals and had the ball twice over the final five minutes in an attempt to score the go-ahead touchdown. Kentucky's final drive of the night began on its own 20-yard line and was dissipated by a Quincy Wilson interception on fourth-and-27 to lift the Gators to the win.\n\nKentucky's defense stymied the Gator attack for the entire second half. Five Wildcats registered six or more tackles on the night, led by Khalid Henderson's nine stops.   UK posted three tackles for a loss and J.D. Harmon picked off a pass in the end zone to halt a Florida drive in the middle of the third quarter that would have pushed UF's lead to three scores. The interception sparked a momentum change in the game as UK would go on to put together back-to-back scoring drives.\n\nUK quarterback Patrick Towles was 8 of 24 on the night with 126 yards and two interceptions. Running back Stanley \"Boom\" Williams rushed 16 times for 80 yards \u2013 snapping his three-game 100-yard rushing streak. Dorian Baker led the receivers with four hauls for 38 yards, including a big fourth-down catch late in the game.  Florida's Will Grier threw for 125 yards and rushed for a team-high 61 yards that included a 1-yard touchdown scamper in the opening quarter.\n\nFollowing Harmon's interception in the third quarter, Towles' 33-yard scramble highlighted a 75-yard drive by the Wildcats to inch closer at 14\u20136 with 14:50 in the fourth. MacGinnis connected on a 22-yard field goal for the Wildcats to make it a one-possession game.  After the UK defense forced a three-and-out, MacGinnis made it a five-point contest with 10:57 to go with a 45-yard field goal. Towles found Jeff Badet for a 45-yard strike down the left sideline to push the Wildcats into field-goal range as the drive's highlight.\n\nFollowing UK's third field goal of the game, Florida managed one first down before being forced to punt with 8:34 remaining. Faced with a third-and-10 from its own 22, Towles found Baker open on the right sideline to keep the drive alive. Williams followed with a 14-yard rush, but the drive stalled at UK's 48. Punter Landon Foster pinned the Gators inside the 20 with 6:10 to go.   The Gators picked up two first downs and killed 3:44 of clock before punting back to the Wildcats, which began the final drive at their own 20. Towles and Baker hooked up for a 20-yard gain on fourth-and-3 at the Kentucky 27 to keep the drive alive. Florida sacked Towles for a loss of 12 on third-and-10 from the UK 47 and then the Wildcats committed a false start. Towels' deep ball down the left side line intended for Ryan Timmons was picked off by Wilson to preserve the Gators' victory.\n\n====Vs.

Towles led UK to its first league victory at the New Commonwealth Stadium and its first win over a ranked opponent since 2010 when Kentucky defeated No. 9 South Carolina. The win over the Tigers signified the first win over a top-25 opponent in the Mark Stoops era.\n\nTowles directed scoring drives in the third and fourth quarters to ignite the offensive effort in the second half. The junior gunslinger found CJ Conrad for a 24-yard strike before connecting with Dorian Baker with less than seven minutes to play to give the Wildcats a 14-point lead it would not relinquish.  Towles had his most consistent game of the season, connecting on 22-of-27 passes for 249 yards with the two touchdown passes. He also added a 14-yard scamper for a score in the opening half.\n\nDefensively, C.J. Johnson paced the Wildcats with 11 tackles, besting his career high by five. Senior linebacker Josh Forrest added nine tackles, while Jason Hatcher posted eight stops to aid the stout defensive effort. Kentucky yielded just 14 points per game through its opening three games against SEC foes.\n\nKentucky, which had not won against Mizzou since the Tigers joined the SEC in 2012, had a number of player milestones as well. With his 6-yard carry with 1:24 remaining in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory, running back JoJo Kemp became the 34th Wildcat to rush for 1,000 yards in a career. The junior led the UK attack on the ground, racking up 66 yards on 13 attempts.  Garrett Johnson led the team in receiving with a season-high 119 yards, including a long of 35 yards that matched his season best. Conrad had a breakout game, not only recording his first career catch but also his first career touchdown with 55 yards of offense through the air. Baker also had a standout game, matching his career high of 51 yards and recording the second touchdown of his career.\n\nFollowing a rocky start to the drive that found the Wildcats in a first-and-29 situation, Towles found Johnson for consecutive 20-plus-yard throws to move the chains and get UK into Missouri territory for the first time in the contest. Kentucky continued to cruise downfield, closing out the quarter on the 14-yard line.  The short break did not derail the Wildcats as Towles used the opening play of the second quarter to dodge and weave through the Tiger defense for a rushing touchdown. That knotted the score at seven apiece.   Much like the start of the game, the second half started slow before Missouri struck late in the third quarter. However, the Tigers were left to settle for a field goal in lieu of a touchdown with 6:04 remaining, with Andrew Baggett sending a 39-yarder through the uprights to give MU a slight 10\u20137 edge.\n\nKemp acted as the catalyst for the team, as three of his carries totaled a combined 37 yards, giving UK a first-and-goal late in the third quarter. Though Kemp moved the offense down the field for the bulk of the drive, it was Conrad who would complete it for the Wildcats, pulling down a perfect 24-yard toss from Towles for the first touchdown of his career. With the addition of the extra point, Kentucky was able to take its first lead of the game with just under two minutes remaining in the third quarter, leading by a count of 14\u201310.\n\n====Vs. <small>(FCS)</small> Eastern Kentucky====\n{{See also|2015 Eastern Kentucky Colonels football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Eastern Kentucky vs Kentucky Wildcats \u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 3, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road=Eastern Kentucky\n|R1=0|R2=6|R3=7|R4=14|R5=0\n|home='''Kentucky'''\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=14|H5=7\n|stadium= [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] \u2022 [[Lexington, Kentucky]] \t\n|attendance=63,380\n|weather=50 deg., Light rain\n|referee= David Smith\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= Mike Couzens (Play-by-play), [[Cole Cubelic]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"EKUPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/56099cd8e4b0f197185e768a |title=Eastern Kentucky pre-game notes |date=September 28, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 21, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"EKUStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015 |title=Eastern Kentucky vs. Kentucky: Scoring Summary |date=October 4, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006094708/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015# |archive-date=October 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 0:51 (UK 7\u20130)\n;Second Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 1-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick failed), 8:49 (UK 7\u20136)\n;Third Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Bennie Coney, 1-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 10:59 (EKU 13\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jeff Badet, 36-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick failed), 8:23 (Tied 13\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Dy'Shawn Mobley, 6-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 12:50 (EKU 20\u201313)\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 15-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick), 7:39 (EKU 27\u201313)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 7-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 4:59 (EKU 27\u201320)\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:52 (Tied 27\u201327)\n;Overtime\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:00 (UK 34\u201327)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* EKU \u2013 Coney \u2013 19/32, 183\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 29/42, 329\n;Top Rushers\n* EKU \u2013 Thomas \u2013 20\u201384\n* UK \u2013 Kemp \u2013 14\u201346\n;Top Receiving\n* EKU \u2013 Mobley \u2013 5\u201350\n* UK \u2013 Baker \u2013 8\u201386\n}}\n\nDespite trailing by 14 points with less than eight minutes in the fourth quarter, the Kentucky football team celebrated its 100th Homecoming anniversary at The New CWS in thrilling fashion, notching a 34-27 comeback overtime victory over in-state foe Eastern Kentucky.\n\nKentucky rallied from a 27\u201313 deficit late in the fourth quarter with back-to-back game-saving drives. Facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of regulation, Patrick Towles stood in the face of a blitz and found Dorian Baker for a 5-yard touchdown to force overtime.\n\nThe duo connected again in overtime with a 3-yard pitch-and-catch to take a 34\u201327 lead. CJ Johnson, who recorded 19 tackles, the most by a defensive lineman in program history, fittingly sealed the outcome with a game-clinching sack.  Eight of Johnson's 19 tackles were solo stops, including a sack and two-and-a-half tackles for loss. Ryan Flannigan was one tackle off his career best with 11 tackles, Josh Forrest recorded double-digit tackles with 10 stops on the night, and Farrington Huguenin blocked a field goal and recovered a fumble.\n\nCoupled with 2014's opening five games, it marks the first time that UK has been 4-1 for two consecutive seasons since 1976\u201377.\n \nTowles rebounded from a two-interception first half to lead the offense for the Wildcats, connecting on 29-of-42 pass attempts for 329 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a rushing score. Towles surpassed the 300-yard mark for the first time this season and the fourth of his career.  The duo of Baker and Blake Bone carried the offense in receiving with 86 and 85 yards, respectively. Both bested their career highs by more than 20 yards each, and Baker's two touchdowns, which included the game-tying and game-winning catches, is a career best for the wide receiver. \n \nThe Wildcats retain an unblemished all-time record against the Colonels and advance to 4\u20131 on the season with the victory.\n\n====Vs.

Auburn earned a 10-point advantage at 30\u201320 with less than eight minutes to play before the Wildcats pulled to within three following a Mikel Horton 1-yard plunge. Kentucky was able to get the ball back with 2:12 remaining, but UK failed to convert on fourth-and-3 from the Auburn 44 to allow the Tigers to clinch the victory.\n\nPatrick Towles posted more than 300 yards of offense for the second consecutive game, racking up 359 yards on 27-of-44 passing with one interception. The junior gunslinger had five 20-plus-yard tosses for the evening, including a pair of throws longer than 35 yards.  Garrett Johnson was Towles' primary target for the long ball, as he posted a career-best 160 yards receiving, including a season-long 39-yard catch that started a drive to help the Wildcats chip away at a 10-point deficit in the second quarter.  Marcus McWilson led the way for the UK defense, tying his career best in total tackles after making 10 stops. Josh Forrest was not far behind with nine tackles, and Jason Hatcher also matched his career mark with seven takedowns.\n\nFor the Tigers, Sean White led the team on 17-of-27 passing for 255 yards, 154 of which went into the hands of Ricardo Louis to lead the team in receiving. On the ground, Peyton Barber rushed for 92 yards and two touchdowns, while Kerryon Johnson added 36 yards and a touchdown for Auburn.\n\nKentucky's running backs paced the team in scoring, with Stanley \"Boom\" Williams returning to action to rush for 113 yards and two touchdowns, including a 60-yard sprint that the sophomore would follow up with the opening touchdown for the Wildcats. Horton also notched a touchdown for the Wildcats, making the most of his five carries in the third quarter to bring UK within three points of the Tigers in the final minutes of the game.\n\n====At Mississippi State====\n{{See also|2015 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kentucky Wildcats vs Mississippi State \u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 24, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road=Kentucky\n|R1=10|R2=3|R3=3|R4=0\n|home='''Mississippi State'''\n|H1=7|H2=21|H3=7|H4=7\n|stadium= [[Davis Wade Stadium]] \u2022 [[Starkville, Mississippi]] \t\n|attendance= 61,168\n|weather= 75 deg, Partly Cloudy\n|referee= Tom Ritter\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brent Musburger]] (play-by-play), [[Jesse Palmer]] (analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"MSUPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/5625088fe4b0b9018928fe9b |title=Mississippi State pre-game notes |date=October 19, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 19, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"MSUStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-suffer-first-road-loss-of-season-at-miss-state-10-24-2015 |title=Kentucky vs Mississippi State: Scoring Summary |date=October 24, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027051210/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-suffer-first-road-loss-of-season-at-miss-state-10-24-2015# |archive-date=October 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 8:19 (UK 7\u20130)\n* MSU \u2013 Dak Prescott, 1-yard run (Westin Graves kick), 5:24 (Tied 7\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 44-yard field goal, 1:53 (UK 10\u20137)\n;Second Quarter\n* MSU \u2013 De'Runnya Wilson, 13-yard pass from Prescott (Graves kick), 13:38 (MSU 14\u201310)\n* MSU \u2013 Brandon Holloway, 8-yard pass from Prescott (Graves kick), 1:34 (MSU 21\u201310)\n* MSU \u2013 Dak Prescott, 20-yard run (Graves kick), 0:34 (MSU 28\u201310)\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 48-yard field goal, 0:03 (MSU 28\u201313)\n;Third Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 32-yard field goal, 2:55 (MSU 28\u201316)\n* MSU \u2013 Darrion Hutcherson, 13-yard pass from Prescott (Graves kick), 0:59 (MSU 35\u201316)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* MSU \u2013 Dak Prescott, 18-yard run (Graves kick), 4:44 (MSU 42\u201316)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 23/42, 218\n* MSU \u2013 Prescott \u2013 25/35, 348\n;Top Rushers\n* UK \u2013 B.

Mike Edwards returned an interception 20 yards for another Wildcats score that handed the 49ers (2-9) their ninth straight loss.  Redshirt freshman Drew Barker added 129 yards passing in his first career start for Kentucky, which earned the first of two wins needed to reach the threshold for bowl eligibility. The Wildcats' defense held Charlotte to just 233 yards, recorded four sacks and forced three turnovers.  Miles Butler kicked field goals of 21, 46 and 32 yards for Kentucky.  Kentucky registered 50 points for the first time since August 2014 against UT Martin, and their 48-point victory margin was its largest since beating UTEP 77\u201317 in 2002.\n\n====Vs.

Kentucky received the opening kickoff and marched down the field, taking a 7\u20130 lead on a one-yard rush by quarterback Drew Barker. After an A.J. Stamps interception, Kentucky took advantage of a short field, going 13 yards in two plays, capped off by a six-yard touchdown rush by Boom Williams to make it 14-0 Kentucky.\n\nOn Louisville's next possession, Kentucky intercepted Louisville quarterback Kyle Bolin for the second time, and Josh Forrest returned the pick 81 yards for a touchdown to make it 21\u20130, still in the first quarter. Louisville got on the board late in the first quarter when backup quarterback [[Lamar Jackson]] rushed 16 yards for a score to make it 21\u20137. In the second quarter, Kentucky added a 20-yard field goal by Miles Butler to take a 24\u20137 lead, which would be the halftime score. Louisville rallied in the second half, eventually taking the lead late in the third quarter, and going on to the victory. Dorian Baker had three catches for 94 yards for Kentucky, while Mikel Horton had 44 yards on the ground to lead the Cats.\n\n==Team statistics==\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"\n|-\n! !!

Also, he was regent of Legnica during 1364\u20131373.\n\n==Life==\nLouis was the second son of the Silesian duke [[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]], then ruling over Legnica and Brzeg, by his first wife, the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] princess [[Margaret of Bohemia, Duchess of Wroclaw|Margaret]], a daughter of King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]. Louis was the youngest son of the ducal couple who survived adulthood. The third and last son, Nikolaus was born and died in 1322, shortly before their mother.\n\nLike his elder brother, little was known of Louis I's early years; his first formal appearance was in 1329 on the occasion of the renewal of his father's homage to the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] king [[John of Bohemia]]. In the following years Louis spent much of his time at the royal court in [[Prague]]. It was there where he probably learned about politics and government.\n\nIn 1342 Boles\u0142aw III's huge debts forced him to cede the Duchy of Legnica to his sons Wenceslaus and Louis, while he retired with his second wife [[Katarina \u0160ubi\u0107]] to the Duchy of Brzeg (which also included [[O\u0142awa]] as well as [[Namys\u0142\u00f3w]], returned to him by his eldest son Wenceslaus). During the first three years, both brothers ruled jointly without major problems until Wenceslaus, after years of childless marriage, lost all his hopes to have children and decided to give most of the Legnica territory to Louis. The formal divisionary treaty took place on 9 August 1345 in the Silesian capital [[Wroclaw]] and was personally signed by King John of Bohemia. Louis I received the richest part of the Duchy and the residence in [[Legnica]].\n\nHowever, the breakdown between the brothers took place only one year later. In 1346 Wenceslaus - whose wife, after eight years of marriage was finally expecting their first child - tried to modify the treaty, under which Louis gave up all his lands to his elder brother (who apparently was dying), and in exchange, he was named his sole heir, even in the case of the birth of a son. As a temporary compensation, Louis received 400 pieces of silver ''per year'' and the possession of the palace of [[Byczyna]].\n\nIt soon became apparent the reality was totally different. The \"ill\" Wenceslaus wasn't in any danger of dying. In addition, the situation was more complicated after the birth of the first of Wenceslaus's four sons, Rupert. Now Wenceslaus wanted to force his brother to renounce his succession rights, and Louis saw how his brother reduced the payment of his allowance. However, Louis's financial situation was not so bad as he was able to buy the town of [[Lubin]] from his father and moved there with his family.\n\nBetween 1349 and 1350 Louis took part in a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. After the death of his father Boles\u0142aw III in 1352, Louis opted for a military solution to the conflicts with his brother. The war lasted for nearly six years (with interruptions thanks to the mediation attempts of Duke [[Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica]], of the Bishop of Wroclaw, [[Preczlaw of Pogarell]] and Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] himself). The final agreement concluded between the brothers was signed on 23 July 1359. The winner in the conflict was Louis, who in addition to the confirmation of his government over Lubin, obtained from Wenceslas I the town of [[Chojn\u00f3w]], half of the O\u0142awa territory, the Duchy of Brzeg and a monetary compensation of 4,500 pieces of silver. For his part, Louis promised to pay half of his late father's debts and formally renounced all claim over the Duchy of Legnica.\n\nWenceslaus died on 2 June 1364, leaving four underage sons. Louis took the regency on behalf of his nephews until 1373 (initially he shared the regency with his sister-in-law, Anna of Teschen, until 1367). From the beginning of his regency, he made significant efforts to save the Legnica treasury and to eliminate the specter of bankruptcy. His talent in government affairs caused Louis I to be actively involved in the rule of Legnica by the request of his eldest nephew Rupert I, who followed most of his advice.\n\nThanks to the great improvement of the Legnica finances, Louis I was able to retake the half of the Duchy of Brzeg-O\u0142awa lost by his late brother (in 1368) and also acquired the towns of [[Kluczbork]], [[Byczyna]], [[Wo\u0142czyn]] (in 1373) and [[Niemcza]] (years 1392-1395).\n\nIn order to maintain his sole authority over his lands, despite the attainment of majority of his eldest son Henry VII, Louis I didn't give him a separate state, and only named him co-regent - but without any real power - in 1360 or 1361. Henry VII received his own district only in 1395 (at the age of 52 years): Niemcza, purchased by his father three years before.\n\nLouis I participated actively in foreign politics. On 21 May 1379, with his brother Wenceslaus I, he renewed his homage to [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]]. In exchange, the King promised the succession to the whole Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg only to the descendants of Boles\u0142aw III the Generous from then on, which saved this line of the House of Piast from further intrusions by their relatives. A second renewal of homage took place on 6 January 1383, but this time Louis I had to renounce any claims over the duchies whose current holders were relatives of the King of Bohemia: [[Wroclaw]], [[Schweidnitz]] and [[Jawor]].\n\nOn 12 June 1397 Louis took part in the [[Congress of \u0141ubnice]], at which were present, among others, King [[Jogaila|Vladislaus II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] and [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn]].\n\nThe dynastic politics of Louis I had also a good result. He managed to orchestrate the marriages of his oldest daughter Margaret to Albert I of Bavaria, son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis IV]] and his only son Henry VII (then a long-time widower) to Margaret of Masovia, widow of [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]]; also he arranged the marriage of his nephew Rupert I to Hedwig of \u017baga\u0144, widow of King [[Casimir III the Great]]. Louis I expected that with these marriages he would have additional arguments to fight for the Polish throne after the death of King Casimir III. Very quickly it became clear that the prospects for the throne of Krak\u00f3w were very distant. Finally, in 1396 he made an alliance with the new ruler of Poland, Vladislaus II Jagie\u0142\u0142o against [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk]].\n\nThe reputation of the Duke of Brzeg was so great that Louis I had been repeatedly appointed by Charles IV and Wenceslaus IV as a mediator in disputes (as in 1365 between the Bishop Przec\u0142aw von Pogarell and Duke Conrad I of Ole\u015bnica, in 1367 between the sons of Duke [[Nicholas II, Duke of Troppau|Nicholas II of Troppau]] for the division of the Duchy or in 1373 between Duke [[Konrad II the Gray|Conrad II of Ole\u015bnica]] and [[Przemyslaw I Noszak]] for the Duchy of [[Bytom]]).\n\nLouis I, during his long government, was known as a founder of a number of laic and religious buildings (such as castles in Lubin and Brzeg with their respective Chapels and the Kolegiata Chapter in Brzeg). At this time the ''[[Hedwig Codex|Kodeks lubi\u0144ski]]'' was also made, which illustrated the life of his great-great-great-grandmother St. [[Hedwig of Andechs]], whose cult he promoted throughout all his reign.\n\nLouis I died between 6 and 23 December 1398 and was buried in the collegiate [[St. Jadwiga's Church, Brzeg|church of St Hedwig]] in Brzeg.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nAround 1341, Louis married Agnes (b. ca. 1321 \u2013 d. 7 July 1362), daughter of Duke [[Henry IV the Faithful|Henry IV of G\u0142og\u00f3w-\u017baga\u0144]] and widow of Duke [[Leszek of Racib\u00f3rz]]. They had six children:\n# [[Margaret of Brieg|Margaret]] (b. 1342/43 \u2013 d. 18/22 February 1386), married aft. 19 July 1353 to [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria]]\n# [[Henry VII of Brzeg|Henry VII with a Scar]] (b. 1343/45 \u2013 d. 11 July 1399)\n# Catherine (b. ca. 1344 \u2013 d. 10 April 1404/4 October 1405?),  Abbess of [[Trzebnica|Trebnitz]] (1372)\n# Hedwig (b. 1346 \u2013 d. ca. 30 January 1385), married ca. 1366 to [[Jan II of O\u015bwi\u0119cim|Jan II, Duke of O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]\n# Wenceslaus (b. ca. 1350 \u2013 d. aft. 15 September 1358)\n# A daughter (b. bef.

In 1346 Wenceslaus - whose wife, after eight years of marriage was finally expecting their first child - tried to modify the treaty, under which Louis gave up all his lands to his elder brother (who apparently was dying), and in exchange, he was named his sole heir, even in the case of the birth of a son. As a temporary compensation, Louis received 400 pieces of silver ''per year'' and the possession of the palace of [[Byczyna]].\n\nIt soon became apparent the reality was totally different. The \"ill\" Wenceslaus wasn't in any danger of dying. In addition, the situation was more complicated after the birth of the first of Wenceslaus's four sons, Rupert. Now Wenceslaus wanted to force his brother to renounce his succession rights, and Louis saw how his brother reduced the payment of his allowance. However, Louis's financial situation was not so bad as he was able to buy the town of [[Lubin]] from his father and moved there with his family.\n\nBetween 1349 and 1350 Louis took part in a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. After the death of his father Boles\u0142aw III in 1352, Louis opted for a military solution to the conflicts with his brother. The war lasted for nearly six years (with interruptions thanks to the mediation attempts of Duke [[Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica]], of the Bishop of Wroclaw, [[Preczlaw of Pogarell]] and Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] himself). The final agreement concluded between the brothers was signed on 23 July 1359. The winner in the conflict was Louis, who in addition to the confirmation of his government over Lubin, obtained from Wenceslas I the town of [[Chojn\u00f3w]], half of the O\u0142awa territory, the Duchy of Brzeg and a monetary compensation of 4,500 pieces of silver. For his part, Louis promised to pay half of his late father's debts and formally renounced all claim over the Duchy of Legnica.\n\nWenceslaus died on 2 June 1364, leaving four underage sons. Louis took the regency on behalf of his nephews until 1373 (initially he shared the regency with his sister-in-law, Anna of Teschen, until 1367). From the beginning of his regency, he made significant efforts to save the Legnica treasury and to eliminate the specter of bankruptcy. His talent in government affairs caused Louis I to be actively involved in the rule of Legnica by the request of his eldest nephew Rupert I, who followed most of his advice.\n\nThanks to the great improvement of the Legnica finances, Louis I was able to retake the half of the Duchy of Brzeg-O\u0142awa lost by his late brother (in 1368) and also acquired the towns of [[Kluczbork]], [[Byczyna]], [[Wo\u0142czyn]] (in 1373) and [[Niemcza]] (years 1392-1395).\n\nIn order to maintain his sole authority over his lands, despite the attainment of majority of his eldest son Henry VII, Louis I didn't give him a separate state, and only named him co-regent - but without any real power - in 1360 or 1361. Henry VII received his own district only in 1395 (at the age of 52 years): Niemcza, purchased by his father three years before.\n\nLouis I participated actively in foreign politics. On 21 May 1379, with his brother Wenceslaus I, he renewed his homage to [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]]. In exchange, the King promised the succession to the whole Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg only to the descendants of Boles\u0142aw III the Generous from then on, which saved this line of the House of Piast from further intrusions by their relatives. A second renewal of homage took place on 6 January 1383, but this time Louis I had to renounce any claims over the duchies whose current holders were relatives of the King of Bohemia: [[Wroclaw]], [[Schweidnitz]] and [[Jawor]].\n\nOn 12 June 1397 Louis took part in the [[Congress of \u0141ubnice]], at which were present, among others, King [[Jogaila|Vladislaus II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] and [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn]].\n\nThe dynastic politics of Louis I had also a good result. He managed to orchestrate the marriages of his oldest daughter Margaret to Albert I of Bavaria, son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis IV]] and his only son Henry VII (then a long-time widower) to Margaret of Masovia, widow of [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]]; also he arranged the marriage of his nephew Rupert I to Hedwig of \u017baga\u0144, widow of King [[Casimir III the Great]]. Louis I expected that with these marriages he would have additional arguments to fight for the Polish throne after the death of King Casimir III. Very quickly it became clear that the prospects for the throne of Krak\u00f3w were very distant. Finally, in 1396 he made an alliance with the new ruler of Poland, Vladislaus II Jagie\u0142\u0142o against [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk]].\n\nThe reputation of the Duke of Brzeg was so great that Louis I had been repeatedly appointed by Charles IV and Wenceslaus IV as a mediator in disputes (as in 1365 between the Bishop Przec\u0142aw von Pogarell and Duke Conrad I of Ole\u015bnica, in 1367 between the sons of Duke [[Nicholas II, Duke of Troppau|Nicholas II of Troppau]] for the division of the Duchy or in 1373 between Duke [[Konrad II the Gray|Conrad II of Ole\u015bnica]] and [[Przemyslaw I Noszak]] for the Duchy of [[Bytom]]).\n\nLouis I, during his long government, was known as a founder of a number of laic and religious buildings (such as castles in Lubin and Brzeg with their respective Chapels and the Kolegiata Chapter in Brzeg). At this time the ''[[Hedwig Codex|Kodeks lubi\u0144ski]]'' was also made, which illustrated the life of his great-great-great-grandmother St. [[Hedwig of Andechs]], whose cult he promoted throughout all his reign.\n\nLouis I died between 6 and 23 December 1398 and was buried in the collegiate [[St. Jadwiga's Church, Brzeg|church of St Hedwig]] in Brzeg.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nAround 1341, Louis married Agnes (b. ca. 1321 \u2013 d. 7 July 1362), daughter of Duke [[Henry IV the Faithful|Henry IV of G\u0142og\u00f3w-\u017baga\u0144]] and widow of Duke [[Leszek of Racib\u00f3rz]]. They had six children:\n# [[Margaret of Brieg|Margaret]] (b. 1342/43 \u2013 d. 18/22 February 1386), married aft. 19 July 1353 to [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria]]\n# [[Henry VII of Brzeg|Henry VII with a Scar]] (b. 1343/45 \u2013 d. 11 July 1399)\n# Catherine (b. ca. 1344 \u2013 d. 10 April 1404/4 October 1405?),  Abbess of [[Trzebnica|Trebnitz]] (1372)\n# Hedwig (b. 1346 \u2013 d. ca. 30 January 1385), married ca. 1366 to [[Jan II of O\u015bwi\u0119cim|Jan II, Duke of O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]\n# Wenceslaus (b. ca. 1350 \u2013 d. aft. 15 September 1358)\n# A daughter (b. bef.
