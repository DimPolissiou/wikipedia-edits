{"title_page": "Georgian Dublin", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2010}}\n[[Image:MaltonCH.jpg|thumb|240px|<center>18th century view of the [[Royal Exchange, Dublin|Royal Exchange]] one of \"Malton's views of Dublin\"</center>]]\n\n'''''Georgian Dublin''''' is a phrase used in terms of the [[history of Dublin]] that has two interwoven meanings:\n# to describe a historic period in the development of the city of [[Dublin]], Ireland, from 1714 (the beginning of the reign of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of Great Britain and of Ireland) to the death in 1830 of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. During this period, the reign of the four Georges, hence the word ''Georgian'', covers a particular and unified style, derived from [[Palladian Architecture]], which was used in erecting public and private buildings\n# to describe the modern day surviving buildings in Dublin erected in that period and which share that architectural style\n\nThough, strictly speaking, [[Georgian architecture]] could only exist during the reigns of the four Georges, it had its antecedents prior to 1714 and its style of building continued to be erected after 1830, until replaced by later styles named after the then monarch, Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], i.e. ''Victorian''.\n\n==Dublin's development==\nDublin was for much of its existence a [[medieval]] city, marked by the existence of a particular style of buildings, built on narrow winding medieval streets. The first major changes to this pattern occurred during the reign of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] when the then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Earl of Ormonde]] (later made [[Duke of Ormonde]]) issued an instruction which was to have dramatic repercussions for the city as it exists today. Though the city over the century had grown around the [[River Liffey]], as in many other medieval cities, buildings backed onto the river. This allowed the dumping of household waste directly into the river, creating a form of collective sewer. As Dublin's quays underwent development, Ormonde insisted that the ''frontages'' of the houses, not their rears, should face the quay sides, with a street to run along each quay. By this single regulation Ormonde changed the face of the city. No longer would the river be a sewer hidden between buildings. Instead it became a central feature of the city, with its quays lined by large three and four-storey houses and classic public buildings, such as the [[Four Courts]], the old Custom House and, later and grander, [[The Custom House]] designed, as was the Four Courts, by master architect [[James Gandon]]. For his initiative, Ormonde's name is now given to one of the city quays. \n\nIt was, however, only one of a number of crucial developments. As the city grew in size, stature, population and wealth, two changes were needed. (1) The existing narrow street medieval city required major redevelopment, and (2) major new development of residential areas was required.\n\n==Rebuilding Dublin's Core==\n[[File:Electric chandeliers, georgian ceiling in Dublin, May 2003.jpg|thumb|An example of Georgian opulence.<br>A ceiling from the Dublin townhouse of [[Viscount Powerscourt]], showing the splendour of Georgian decoration. His former townhouse was sensitively turned into a shopping centre in the 1980s.]] A new body called the [[Wide Streets Commission]] was created to remodel the old medieval city. It created a network of main thoroughfares by wholesale demolition or widening of old streets or the creation of entirely new ones. On the north side of the city, a series of narrow streets were merged and widened enormously to create a new street, called ''Sackville Street'' (now called [[O'Connell Street]]). At its lower end, a new bridge (now called [[O'Connell Bridge]]) was erected, beyond which two new streets in the form of a 'V' appeared, known as [[Westmoreland Street]] and [[D'Olier Street]]. Westmoreland Street in turn led to a renamed ''Hoggen Green'', which became ''[[College Green, Dublin|College Green]]'' because it faced unto [[Trinity College Dublin]]. The new [[Irish Houses of Parliament]], designed by [[Edward Lovett Pearce]], also faced onto College Green, while from College Green a new widened [[Dame Street]] led directly down to the medieval [[Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin]], past [[Dublin Castle]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]], the latter a new building. The Castle began the process of rebuilding, turning it from a medieval castle to a Georgian palace.\n\n==18th Century Property Developers==\n[[File:Mountjoy Square, Dublin, Ireland (January 2010).jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Square]], Dublin, Ireland (January 2010)]] \nWhile the rebuilding by the Wide Streets Commission fundamentally changed the streetscape in Dublin, a property boom led to additional building outside the central core. Unlike twentieth century building booms in Dublin the eighteenth century developments were carefully controlled. The developing areas were divided into precincts, each of which was given to a different developer. The scope of their developments were restricted, however, with strict controls imposed on style of residential building, design of buildings and location, so producing a cohesive unity that came to be called Georgian Dublin. \n\n[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|left|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. The street contains some of the oldest and largest Georgian houses in Dublin. It was converted into tenements in the latter part of the 19th century.]]\nInitially developments were focused on the city's north side. Among the earliest developments was ''Henrietta Street'', a wide street lined on both sides by massive Georgian houses built on a palatial scale. At the top end of the street, a new [[James Gandon]] building, the ''[[King's Inns]]'', was erected between 1795 and 1816. In this building, [[barrister]]s were trained and earned their academic qualifications. Such was the prestige of the street that many of the most senior figures in Irish 'establishment' society, [[peers of the realm]], judges, barristers, bishops bought houses here. Under the [[anti-Catholic]] [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], [[Roman Catholic]]s, though the overwhelming majority in Ireland, were harshly discriminated against, barred from holding property rights or from voting in parliamentary elections until 1793. Thus the houses of Georgian Dublin, particularly in the early phase before [[Catholic Emancipation]] was granted in 1829, were almost invariably owned by a small [[Church of Ireland]] [[Anglican]] elite, with Catholics only gaining admittance to the houses as skivvies and servants. Ultimately the north side was laid out centred on two major squares, ''Rutland Square'' (now called ''[[Parnell Square]]'' for [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]), at the top end of Sackville Street, and ''[[Mountjoy Square]]''. Such was the prestige of the latter square that among its many prominent residents was the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]]. Many of the streets in the new areas were named after the property developers, often with developers commemorated both in their name and by their peerage when the received one. Among the streets named after developers are ''Capel Street'', ''Mountjoy Square'' and ''Aungier Street''. \n\n[[File:Dublin Castle Four Court.jpg|thumb|[[Dublin Castle]]'s Georgian Upper Castle Yard<br>The main body of the Castle was rebuilt along Georgian lines following a disastrous fire in the late seventeenth century]]\nFor the initial years of the Georgian era, the north side of the city was considered a far more respectable area to live. However, when the [[Earl of Kildare]] chose to move to a new large ducal palace built for him on what up to that point was seen as the ''inferior'' southside, he caused shock. When his Dublin townhouse, Kildare House (renamed [[Leinster House]] when he was made Duke of Leinster) was finished, it was by far the biggest aristocratic residence other than Dublin Castle, and it was greeted with envy. \n\nThe Earl had predicted that his move would be followed, and it was. Three new residential squares appeared on the southside, [[Merrion Square]] (facing his residence's garden front), [[St Stephen's Green]] and the smallest and last of Dublin's five Georgian squares to be built, [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. [[Aristocracy (class)|Aristocrats]], bishops and the wealthy sold their northside townhouses and migrated to the new southside developments, even though many of the developments, particularly in Fitzwilliam Square, were smaller and less impressive than the buildings in [[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. While the wealthier people lived in houses ''on'' the squares, those with lesser means and lesser titles lived in smaller, less grand but still impressive developments off the main squares, such as Upper and Lower Mount Street and [[Leeson Street]].\n\n==The Act of Union and Georgian Dublin==\n[[File:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|left|Leinster House<br>18th century ducal palace built by the Duke of Leinster. Since 1922 it has served as the seat of the modern Irish parliament, ''[[Oireachtas \u00c9ireann]]''.]]\n[[File:Djustice.jpg|thumb|upright|A surviving Georgian house on [[St. Stephen's Green]], stuck between a Victorian building (picture right) and a 1960s office block (left). Over half the Georgian buildings on St. Stephen's Green having been lost since the Georgian era, with many demolished in the 1950s and 1960s .]]\n\nAlthough the Irish Parliament was composed exclusively of representatives of the [[Anglo Irish Ascendency]], the established ruling minority Protestant community in Ireland, it did show significant sparks of independence, most notably the achievement of full legislative independence in 1782, where all the restrictions previously surrounding the powers of the new parliament in College Green, notably [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] were repealed. This period of legislative freedom however was short-lived. \n\nIn 1800, under pressure from the British Government of Mr. Pitt, in the wake of the rebellion of the last years of the century, which was aided and abetted by the French invasion in support of the rebels [[Dublin Castle]] administration of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] both the House of Commons and the House of Lords passed the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]], uniting both the Kingdom of Ireland and its parliament with the Kingdom of Great Britain and its parliament in London. As a result, from 1 January 1801 Dublin found itself without a parliament with which to draw hundreds of peers and bishops, along with their thousands of servants. While many did come to Dublin still for the ''Social Season'', where the Lord Lieutenant hosted debutantes balls, state balls and drawing rooms in a period from January until [[St. Patrick's Day]] (17 March) every year, many found them less appealing than in the days when they could sit in parliament for a session in College Green. Many of the leading peers, including the [[Duke of Leinster]] and [[Viscount Powerscourt]], almost immediately sold their palatial Dublin townhouses, Powerscourt House and Leinster House. Though many still flocked to Dublin every social season, many didn't or went to London. The loss of their revenue and that of their extensive staff hurt the Dublin economy severely. While the 'new' Georgian centres southside continued to flourish, the northside Georgian squares soon fell into squalor, as new owners of the buildings crammed in massive numbers of poor into the former residences of earls and bishops, in some cases cramming an entire family into one old drawing room. Mountjoy Square in particular became run-down, until such was its state and degree of dereliction in the 1980s that it was used as a film set for stories set in post-[[the Blitz|blitz]] London and post-[[World War II|war]] [[Berlin]]. The empty shells of the graceful houses, reduced to unsanitary tenements before being demolished in the 1980s, were used as a backdrop for a [[U2]] rock video.\n\n==Georgian Dublin today==\n[[File:Georgian doors in Fitzwilliam Square - geograph.org.uk - 228788.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Georgian doorways in Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. ]]\nIn the years after independence in 1922, [[Irish Free State|independent Ireland]] had little sympathy for Georgian Dublin, viewing it as a symbol of British rule and of the [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] identity that was alien to Irish identity. By this time, many of the gentry who had lived in them had moved elsewhere; some to the wealthy Victorian suburbs of [[Rathmines]] and [[Rathgar]], [[Killiney]] and [[Ballsbridge]], where Victorian residences were built on larger plots of land, allowing for gardens, rather than the lack of space of the Georgian eras. Those that had not moved in many cases had by the early twentieth century sold their mansions in Dublin. The abolition of the [[Dublin Castle]] administration and the Lord Lieutenant in 1922 saw an end to Dublin's traditional \"[[Irish Social Season|Social Season]]\" of masked balls, drawing rooms and court functions in the Castle. Many of the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] families lost their heirs in the [[First World War]], their homes in the country to [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] burnings (during the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]]) and their townhouses to the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]]. Daisy, the [[Countess of Fingall]], in her regularly republished memoirs ''Seventy Years Young'', wrote in the 1920s of the disappearance of that world and of her change from a big townhouse in Dublin, full of servants to a small flat with one maid. By the 1920s and certainly by the 1930s, many of the previous homes in Merrion Square had become business addresses of companies, with only Fitzwilliam Square of all the five squares having any residents. (Curiously, in the 1990s, new wealthy businessmen such as Sir [[Tony O'Reilly]] and [[Dermot Desmond]] began returning to live in former offices they had bought and converted ''back'' into homes.) By the 1930s, plans were discussed in [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government to demolish all of Merrion Square, perhaps the most intact of the five squares, on the basis that the houses were \"old fashioned\" and \"un-national\". These plans were put on hold in 1939 due to the outbreak of [[World War II]] and a lack of capital and investment and had been essentially forgotten about by 1945. \n\n[[File:Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Lower [[Leeson Street]], Dublin, Ireland. [[Mock-Georgian]] houses erected in the 1980s and 1990s, where the previous Georgian buildings had been demolished decades earlier. ]]\nSome destruction of Georgian buildings did still occur despite these circumstances. [[Mountjoy Square]], was under threat when a large amount of property on the south side was demolished by property speculators during the 1960s and 70s; even so, buildings with facsimile facades were subsequently built in place, re-completing the square's uniform external appearance.

During this period, the reign of the four Georges, hence the word ''Georgian'', covers a particular and unified style, derived from [[Palladian Architecture]], which was used in erecting public and private buildings\n# to describe the modern day surviving buildings in Dublin erected in that period and which share that architectural style\n\nThough, strictly speaking, Georgian architecture could only exist during the reigns of the four Georges, it had its antecedents prior to 1714 and its style of building continued to be erected after 1830, until replaced by later styles named after the then monarch, Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], i.e. ''Victorian''.\n\n==Dublin's development==\nDublin was for much of its existence a [[medieval]] city, marked by the existence of a particular style of buildings, built on narrow winding medieval streets. The first major changes to this pattern occurred during the reign of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] when the then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Earl of Ormonde]] (later made [[Duke of Ormonde]]) issued an instruction which was to have dramatic repercussions for the city as it exists today. Though the city over the century had grown around the [[River Liffey]], as in many other medieval cities, buildings backed onto the river. This allowed the dumping of household waste directly into the river, creating a form of collective sewer. As Dublin's quays underwent development, Ormonde insisted that the ''frontages'' of the houses, not their rears, should face the quay sides, with a street to run along each quay. By this single regulation Ormonde changed the face of the city. No longer would the river be a sewer hidden between buildings. Instead it became a central feature of the city, with its quays lined by large three and four-storey houses and classic public buildings, such as the [[Four Courts]], the old Custom House and, later and grander, [[The Custom House]] designed, as was the Four Courts, by master architect [[James Gandon]]. For his initiative, Ormonde's name is now given to one of the city quays. \n\nIt was, however, only one of a number of crucial developments. As the city grew in size, stature, population and wealth, two changes were needed. (1) The existing narrow street medieval city required major redevelopment, and (2) major new development of residential areas was required.\n\n==Rebuilding Dublin's Core==\n[[File:Electric chandeliers, georgian ceiling in Dublin, May 2003.jpg|thumb|An example of Georgian opulence.<br>A ceiling from the Dublin townhouse of [[Viscount Powerscourt]], showing the splendour of Georgian decoration. His former townhouse was sensitively turned into a shopping centre in the 1980s.]] A new body called the [[Wide Streets Commission]] was created to remodel the old medieval city. It created a network of main thoroughfares by wholesale demolition or widening of old streets or the creation of entirely new ones. On the north side of the city, a series of narrow streets were merged and widened enormously to create a new street, called ''Sackville Street'' (now called [[O'Connell Street]]). At its lower end, a new bridge (now called [[O'Connell Bridge]]) was erected, beyond which two new streets in the form of a 'V' appeared, known as [[Westmoreland Street]] and [[D'Olier Street]]. Westmoreland Street in turn led to a renamed ''Hoggen Green'', which became ''[[College Green, Dublin|College Green]]'' because it faced unto [[Trinity College Dublin]]. The new [[Irish Houses of Parliament]], designed by [[Edward Lovett Pearce]], also faced onto College Green, while from College Green a new widened [[Dame Street]] led directly down to the medieval [[Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin]], past [[Dublin Castle]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]], the latter a new building. The Castle began the process of rebuilding, turning it from a medieval castle to a Georgian palace.\n\n==18th Century Property Developers==\n[[File:Mountjoy Square, Dublin, Ireland (January 2010).jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Square]], Dublin, Ireland (January 2010)]] \nWhile the rebuilding by the Wide Streets Commission fundamentally changed the streetscape in Dublin, a property boom led to additional building outside the central core. Unlike twentieth century building booms in Dublin the eighteenth century developments were carefully controlled. The developing areas were divided into precincts, each of which was given to a different developer. The scope of their developments were restricted, however, with strict controls imposed on style of residential building, design of buildings and location, so producing a cohesive unity that came to be called Georgian Dublin. \n\n[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|left|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. The street contains some of the oldest and largest Georgian houses in Dublin. It was converted into tenements in the latter part of the 19th century.]]\nInitially developments were focused on the city's north side. Among the earliest developments was ''Henrietta Street'', a wide street lined on both sides by massive Georgian houses built on a palatial scale. At the top end of the street, a new [[James Gandon]] building, the ''[[King's Inns]]'', was erected between 1795 and 1816. In this building, [[barrister]]s were trained and earned their academic qualifications. Such was the prestige of the street that many of the most senior figures in Irish 'establishment' society, [[peers of the realm]], judges, barristers, bishops bought houses here. Under the [[anti-Catholic]] [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], [[Roman Catholic]]s, though the overwhelming majority in Ireland, were harshly discriminated against, barred from holding property rights or from voting in parliamentary elections until 1793. Thus the houses of Georgian Dublin, particularly in the early phase before [[Catholic Emancipation]] was granted in 1829, were almost invariably owned by a small [[Church of Ireland]] [[Anglican]] elite, with Catholics only gaining admittance to the houses as skivvies and servants. Ultimately the north side was laid out centred on two major squares, ''Rutland Square'' (now called ''[[Parnell Square]]'' for [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]), at the top end of Sackville Street, and ''[[Mountjoy Square]]''. Such was the prestige of the latter square that among its many prominent residents was the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]]. Many of the streets in the new areas were named after the property developers, often with developers commemorated both in their name and by their peerage when the received one. Among the streets named after developers are ''Capel Street'', ''Mountjoy Square'' and ''Aungier Street''. \n\n[[File:Dublin Castle Four Court.jpg|thumb|[[Dublin Castle]]'s Georgian Upper Castle Yard<br>The main body of the Castle was rebuilt along Georgian lines following a disastrous fire in the late seventeenth century]]\nFor the initial years of the Georgian era, the north side of the city was considered a far more respectable area to live. However, when the [[Earl of Kildare]] chose to move to a new large ducal palace built for him on what up to that point was seen as the ''inferior'' southside, he caused shock. When his Dublin townhouse, Kildare House (renamed [[Leinster House]] when he was made Duke of Leinster) was finished, it was by far the biggest aristocratic residence other than Dublin Castle, and it was greeted with envy. \n\nThe Earl had predicted that his move would be followed, and it was. Three new residential squares appeared on the southside, [[Merrion Square]] (facing his residence's garden front), [[St Stephen's Green]] and the smallest and last of Dublin's five Georgian squares to be built, [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. [[Aristocracy (class)|Aristocrats]], bishops and the wealthy sold their northside townhouses and migrated to the new southside developments, even though many of the developments, particularly in Fitzwilliam Square, were smaller and less impressive than the buildings in [[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. While the wealthier people lived in houses ''on'' the squares, those with lesser means and lesser titles lived in smaller, less grand but still impressive developments off the main squares, such as Upper and Lower Mount Street and [[Leeson Street]].\n\n==The Act of Union and Georgian Dublin==\n[[File:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|left|Leinster House<br>18th century ducal palace built by the Duke of Leinster. Since 1922 it has served as the seat of the modern Irish parliament, ''[[Oireachtas \u00c9ireann]]''.]]\n[[File:Djustice.jpg|thumb|upright|A surviving Georgian house on [[St. Stephen's Green]], stuck between a Victorian building (picture right) and a 1960s office block (left). Over half the Georgian buildings on St. Stephen's Green having been lost since the Georgian era, with many demolished in the 1950s and 1960s .]]\n\nAlthough the Irish Parliament was composed exclusively of representatives of the [[Anglo Irish Ascendency]], the established ruling minority Protestant community in Ireland, it did show significant sparks of independence, most notably the achievement of full legislative independence in 1782, where all the restrictions previously surrounding the powers of the new parliament in College Green, notably [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] were repealed. This period of legislative freedom however was short-lived. \n\nIn 1800, under pressure from the British Government of Mr. Pitt, in the wake of the rebellion of the last years of the century, which was aided and abetted by the French invasion in support of the rebels [[Dublin Castle]] administration of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] both the House of Commons and the House of Lords passed the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]], uniting both the Kingdom of Ireland and its parliament with the Kingdom of Great Britain and its parliament in London. As a result, from 1 January 1801 Dublin found itself without a parliament with which to draw hundreds of peers and bishops, along with their thousands of servants. While many did come to Dublin still for the ''Social Season'', where the Lord Lieutenant hosted debutantes balls, state balls and drawing rooms in a period from January until [[St. Patrick's Day]] (17 March) every year, many found them less appealing than in the days when they could sit in parliament for a session in College Green. Many of the leading peers, including the [[Duke of Leinster]] and [[Viscount Powerscourt]], almost immediately sold their palatial Dublin townhouses, Powerscourt House and Leinster House. Though many still flocked to Dublin every social season, many didn't or went to London. The loss of their revenue and that of their extensive staff hurt the Dublin economy severely. While the 'new' Georgian centres southside continued to flourish, the northside Georgian squares soon fell into squalor, as new owners of the buildings crammed in massive numbers of poor into the former residences of earls and bishops, in some cases cramming an entire family into one old drawing room. Mountjoy Square in particular became run-down, until such was its state and degree of dereliction in the 1980s that it was used as a film set for stories set in post-[[the Blitz|blitz]] London and post-[[World War II|war]] [[Berlin]]. The empty shells of the graceful houses, reduced to unsanitary tenements before being demolished in the 1980s, were used as a backdrop for a [[U2]] rock video.\n\n==Georgian Dublin today==\n[[File:Georgian doors in Fitzwilliam Square - geograph.org.uk - 228788.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Georgian doorways in Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. ]]\nIn the years after independence in 1922, [[Irish Free State|independent Ireland]] had little sympathy for Georgian Dublin, viewing it as a symbol of British rule and of the [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] identity that was alien to Irish identity. By this time, many of the gentry who had lived in them had moved elsewhere; some to the wealthy Victorian suburbs of [[Rathmines]] and [[Rathgar]], [[Killiney]] and [[Ballsbridge]], where Victorian residences were built on larger plots of land, allowing for gardens, rather than the lack of space of the Georgian eras. Those that had not moved in many cases had by the early twentieth century sold their mansions in Dublin. The abolition of the [[Dublin Castle]] administration and the Lord Lieutenant in 1922 saw an end to Dublin's traditional \"[[Irish Social Season|Social Season]]\" of masked balls, drawing rooms and court functions in the Castle. Many of the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] families lost their heirs in the [[First World War]], their homes in the country to [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] burnings (during the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]]) and their townhouses to the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]]. Daisy, the [[Countess of Fingall]], in her regularly republished memoirs ''Seventy Years Young'', wrote in the 1920s of the disappearance of that world and of her change from a big townhouse in Dublin, full of servants to a small flat with one maid. By the 1920s and certainly by the 1930s, many of the previous homes in Merrion Square had become business addresses of companies, with only Fitzwilliam Square of all the five squares having any residents. (Curiously, in the 1990s, new wealthy businessmen such as Sir [[Tony O'Reilly]] and [[Dermot Desmond]] began returning to live in former offices they had bought and converted ''back'' into homes.) By the 1930s, plans were discussed in [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government to demolish all of Merrion Square, perhaps the most intact of the five squares, on the basis that the houses were \"old fashioned\" and \"un-national\". These plans were put on hold in 1939 due to the outbreak of [[World War II]] and a lack of capital and investment and had been essentially forgotten about by 1945. \n\n[[File:Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Lower [[Leeson Street]], Dublin, Ireland. [[Mock-Georgian]] houses erected in the 1980s and 1990s, where the previous Georgian buildings had been demolished decades earlier. ]]\nSome destruction of Georgian buildings did still occur despite these circumstances. [[Mountjoy Square]], was under threat when a large amount of property on the south side was demolished by property speculators during the 1960s and 70s; even so, buildings with facsimile facades were subsequently built in place, re-completing the square's uniform external appearance. The world's longest row of Georgian houses, running from the corner of Merrion Square down to Leeson Street Bridge, was divided in the early 1960s to demolish part of the row and replace them with a modern styled office block.\n\n[[File:Fitzwilliam Square West - geograph.org.uk - 1410337.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]] West]]\nBy the 1990s, attitudes had changed dramatically.

The clan does not have a [[clan chief|chief]] now, therefore it is considered by Court of the Lord Lyon and the Stand Council of Scottish Chiefs as an [[Armigerous clan]].<ref name=history>[http://www.clanstrachan.org/history/today.htm History of Clan Strachan]</ref>\n\nClan Strachan held a Family Convention (or Ad Hoc [[Derbhfine]]) under the supervision of the Court of the Lord Lyon on 11 April 2014 in Edinburgh.  The meeting ended amicably with unanimous support for [[Rob Strachan]], Mill of Strachan, Strachan, Aberdeenshire to be recognised as [[Scottish clan chief#Recognition of Chief in Scots law|Commander]].\n\nOn 29 April 2014, Lord Lyon Dr. Joseph Morrow dispatched a letter to the Sennachie of Clan Strachan, Jim Strachan, whereas Lyon wrote, \"I have signed a Warrant authorizing the Lyon Clerk to prepare a Commission appointing Charles Robert Lund Strachan to be Commander of the Hounourable Clan Strachan for a period of 5 years.\"\n\nIn 2024, Clan Strachan hopes to hold another Strachan Family Convention to recognize Rob Strachan as Hereditary Chief of the Honourable Clan Strachan.  The [http://www.clanstrachan.org Clan Strachan Society] will be notifying its membership and those on their email lists of tentative plans as time approaches.\n\nThe Clan Strachan warcry is ''Clachnaben!''<ref name=cry>[http://www.clanstrachan.org/history/warcry.htm Clan Strachan Warcry - Clachnaben!]</ref>\n\n== Highland or Lowland Clan? ==\n\nThe [[Highland Boundary Fault]] is a geologic fault that traverses Scotland from Arran and Helensburgh on the west coast to [[Stonehaven]] in the east. It separates two distinctly different physiographic regions: the Highlands from the Lowlands, but in most places it is only recognisable as a change in topography.\n\nThe village of Strachan ([[Strachan, Aberdeenshire]]) is located some 15 miles northwest of [[Stonehaven]], 3 miles outside of Banchory, north and adjacent to the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. Therefore, the auld Barony of Strachan is located within the Highland Region.  These lands, including Birse and Durris, as well as the Howe O' Mearns fell under the demesne of the Mormaer of the Mearns, M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns. His name means \"tonsured one of (Saint) Peter\".  One source tells us that M\u00e1el Petair was the son of a M\u00e1el Coluim. His name occurs in many sources because he was the man who, in 1094, is often credited for the murder of King Duncan II of Scotland.  Most historians agree that King Edgar, the brother and heir of Duncan II confiscated M\u00e1el Petair's mormaerdom, and converted it to crown lands. By mid-13th century, virtually all of the Mearns were converted to [[Thane (Scotland)|thanages]].\n\nClan Strachan should most appropriately be classified (during the medieval period) as \"a Lowland Family residing within the Highland Region\". This was not uncommon as, for example, the Name of [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]], [[Clan Fraser|Fraser]] and others fall within this same classification.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:KincardineshireTraditional.png|thumb|left|220px|Map of Scotland showing the district of [[Kincardineshire]], where the Strachans of Thornton lived]]\n\n===Origins===\nThis surname of Strachan is local as others of the greatest antiquity and has been according to ancient custom taken from lands. (GC, ii, 265)\n\nAs the Strachan surname is considered a \"local\" or \"territorial\" name it is merely an indication of where the individual came from, and it cannot be assumed that people with the surname are necessarily ancestors.\n\nThe Village of Strachan is located some 20 miles southwest of Aberdeen, in the Royal Deeside Grampian Highlands of Scotland.\n\nThe District of Strachan is about twenty miles in length, extending from the confines of the parish of Durris, on the east; to Mount Battock, on the west; and is twelve miles in breadth, from Cairn-o'-Mount, in the south, to the river Dee, which constitutes its northern boundary, and separates it from the parish of Banchory-Ternan. It encompasses 56,362 acres.  (Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, ii, p.&nbsp;504-5)\n\nThrough the District of Strachan run the Waters of the Dye, the Avon (pronounced: /on/), and Feugh.  The first are tributaries to the latter, which falls into the Dee at Banchory-Teran, where the channel, wild and rocky, shaded by mountain pine, birch, and copsewood, presents a singularly romantic appearance. (Jervise p.&nbsp;4)\n\nThe word Strachan is an anglicized derivative with origins in the Scottish Gaelic (or 'Scottis') language.   It is derived from the Gaelic word \"strath\" meaning \"broad valley\", and \"Aven\" (pronounced /on/) which is a Gaelic word for 'river', and also the name of one of the tributaries of the Dee that runs through the Strachan District (Water of the Aven, or alternatively spelt on other maps \"Water of the Awen\").\n\nAccording to the ''Herald & Genealogist'' (vol. viii,302), Strachan means 'Vale of the Waters,' apparently due to the three main burns in the District (Waters of the Dye, Avon and Feugh).\n\nOthers suggest the Strachan surname means 'Valley of the Avon' (pronounced /on/).  If this definition is accurate, it suggests the main burn in Strachan in or about the year 1200, was the  Water of the Avon. Similarly suggesting the main medieval settlement of Strachan was located much farther to the west than where the main body of the current village is located.  Perhaps just south and west of the Mill of Strachan in the area of Little Ennochie, Balblyth, Weir or Cuttieshillock, in the District of Strachan.\n\n===Charter History of Strachan of that Ilk===\nThe lands of Strachan were granted by [[William the Lion|King William the Lion]] to William Giffard of Lethington, in the barony of Yester, in feu-tenure and in forest with permanent and hereditary rights for an annual render of 9 merks (c. 1189-95, RRS.  ii, no. 340, 410). Simply, the lands of Strachan were owned by the crown, and held 'in forest' as a royal hunting preserve. Evidence also suggests that William Giffard was succeeded by Ranulf (de Strachan) sometime between 1189-1211 (St A. Lib., 276-7), and as such Ranulf de Strachan and his heirs were direct vassals of the crown.\n\nWaltheof de Strachan succeeded Ranulf (c. 1230), and appears to have had an affinity to Fife, and granted part of the lands of Strachan to the priory of St. Andrews in Fife (St A. Lib., 276-7).\n\nIn 1230-1240, Sir Waldeve de Strachechin witnessed an undated charter which is translated as follows:  Alicia (or Alice), daughter of John, son of Ranulph, with the consent of her son and heir John, has given, granted and by this her present charter established to Blessed Queen Margaret and Dunfermline Abbey, in free, pure and perpetual alms, six acres of land with toft and croft in the villa of Cramond \u2018of the Scots\u2019 (MLO)\u2026 in free and perpetual alms.(Dunf. Reg. no 202)  Thus, it is possible, although not for certain, that Strachan of that Ilk may have been blood related to the Cramond family though the female line give the names provided in this charter.\n\nThe cartulary also suggest that Strachan of that Ilk married into the de Quincy family (c. 1196-1264), and obtained at least half the lands of Beath Waldeve (DR, no. 154; RRS, ii, no. 396; DR, no. 86).  Elizabeth de Quincy married Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan, and if this thesis is proved true, it would have made Strachan of the Ilk blood related to the Alexander and Elizabeth's son, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.\n\nIn 1264, 'R' Strachan (believed to be Ranulf de Strachan) was appointed Viscount (Sheriff) of Banffshire (a county North of Aberdeenshire) in succession of Alexander Comyn, the Earl of Buchan. (Exchequer Rolls i, p 15).  This may support the thesis that Strachan of that Ilk were related to the Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan.  Sheriffdoms were generally thought to be hereditary. (Grant. Medieval Scotland, p.&nbsp;57)\n\nin 1268, Elizabeth, Countess of Buchan, formally endorsed the appointment of Ranulph and Michael de Strachan, and William Comyn, named \u2018the Black\u2019 (probably the brother of the Earl of Badenoch and cousin of the Earl of Buchan), to receive her property on her behalf. (CDS / BAIN, i, 2509, 2513)\n\n===Wars of Independence===\nStrachan of that Ilk, holding crown lands, were no doubt beholding to the sovereign and would have supported the King of Scotland, and his heirs.  This being King John Balliol in 1292, and in 1306 would have been Red Comyn.  When Robert the Bruce murdered Red Comyn at the altar at Grayfriars Abbey, the new heir to the throne of Scotland was John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.  Strachan of that Ilk, as mentioned, was likely blood-kin of John Comyn.\n\nBruce forces likely burned-out a timber fortress in Strachan, now called Castlehill of Strachan during the early summer of 1308 (Yeoman).  Comyn, and his loyal supporters which likely included Clan Strachan, were defeated at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1308)]].  After the Battle of Bannockburn (1314), the Strachans were disinherited by Robert the Bruce and the lands of Strachan were granted to Sir Alexander Fraser, thane of Cowie (1316).\n\nBefore 1325, Alexander Strachan, son and heir of John Strachan of that Ilk, and his wife Christina, daughter of Maule of Panmure, was granted by Maule all his land of Carmyllie, his whole land of Drumnadych, his whole land of Hacwrangdrom, half his land of Lochlair, the mill, the grain, Strathyis Copresille (ANG) \u2026 with all their just pertinents, correct bounds, etc.\n\nThe battle of Neville\u2019s Cross took place to the west of Durham, England, on 17 October 1346.  King David of Scotland \u2013 son and heir of Robert the Bruce \u2013 was wounded in the face by two arrows, and eventually captured.  Both Alexander Strachan (spelt Straghern) and his son died fighting alongside of the Earl of Buchan, and all of whom serving in the same division under the direct command of King David of Scotland. (Sir Herbert Maxwell, The Chronicle of Lanercost, 1913, page 339)\n\nAround 1350, many of the families that benefited from Robert the Bruce confiscations and disinheritance rushed to make amends with promises of noble marriages and grants of land.  During this period, five new Houses of Strachan were formed... Knock, Glenkindie, Thornton, Lenturk, and a barony in Aberdeenshire.\n\n===17th-18th century: Civil war and a split in family loyalties===\nSir Alexander Strachan of Thornton obtained the Baronet of Nova Scotia from King Charles I in 1625. The baronetcy passed to a distant relative, Sir James Strachan of Inchtuthill.  Sir James, minister of Keith, is believed to be from the senior line of Monboddo by a charter under the great seal in 1663.\n\nIn 1683, Sir James sold the Mains and Estate of Thornton to his wife's father (Robert Forbes).  Some debate exists as to whether the sale was due to a financial over encumbrance, or fear that a more senior claim might be made.\n\nThe elder Sir James, continued his ministry at Keith until he was deprived of his living by the Privy Council in 1689, because he refused to pray for King William and Mary, but instead prayed for the restoration of King James II. Sir James Strachan (the elder) died at Inverness in 1715.\n\nHis son and heir, also named Sir James entrusted their three daughters and their tutorship to the father of his wife, Barbara Forbes' father.  Sir James joined the Highland force that Calverhouse, for the Viscount Dundee, in support of the deposed King James II.  It is thus apparent the Royalist sentiments passed from father to son.  On 27 July 1689 Bonnie Dundee\u2019s Highlanders met and defeated General Mackay\u2019s army at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]].  Unfortunately, Dundee, and the rising hope of the Jacobite cause, was slain in the hour of its own victory.  Among the highland dead, was also James Strachan, younger of Thornton.\n\nThe kinsmen of Strachan of Thornton, Alexander Strachans of Glenkindie was known as the 'Great Covenanter' (d.c. 1674). This allegiance to the government was passed down to his grandson, Sir Patrick was imprisoned by the Jacobites during the first Rebellion in 1715, and on his release he appears to have been very active in the disarming of the country.\n\nBy 1746, at the [[Battle of Culloden]] all Houses of Strachan were extinct except for the Representor of Thornton who was now residing in London.  Strachan was a broken clan by this time, and progressive generations of this surviving line had begun failing in the male line.  At Culloden, there are a number of Strachans who are recorded in the ranks of the Jacobites.  The remains of John Strachan has been identified at Culloden, and is in the ranks of the Jacobites.  John Strachan is listed among the dead at Culloden Centre at the exit from the battle field film exhibit.\n\n===Napoleonic Wars===\n\nIn the 19th century, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Admiral Sir Richard Strachan]], 6th baronet from the direct line of the chieftainship of the Clan Strachan, commanded a squadron. On 2 November 1805, his squadron engaged four French battleships that had escaped from [[Lord Nelson]]'s triumph at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Sir Richard captured all four French vessels with little loss of British life. He was created a [[Knight of the Bath]] and in 1810 was granted freedom of the [[City of London]].  Sir Richard died in 1829 without male heir.\n\n[[File:Arms of the Clan Strachan Society.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Arms of the Clan Strachan Society]],\n\n===Present day===\n\nThe last chief of Clan Strachan was one Admiral Sir Richard John Strachan (Bart.), RN, who died in 1828. As he was without male heir, his title and the baronetcy became dormant in 1854.\n\nThe Strachan surname is recognized by the Court of the Lord Lyon, and the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs as an [[Armigerous clan]].\n\nAs mentioned above Clan Strachan Society held a Family Convention (Ad Hoc Derbhfine) in 2014 to recognize a new Commander for Clan Strachan, Rob Strachan, Mill of Strachan, Strachan, Aberdeenshire.  The Commander will likely become the hereditary Chief of Clan Strachan after waiting 10 years.  This 'waiting period' is to determine if a more legitimate claimant to the Chiefdom comes forth with a documented blood line (found satisfactory to the Lord Lyon) that proves descent from the past Chief (or a cadet branch therein).  A person with documented blood line to the past Chief (or a cadet branch) would have a priority claim for the Chiefship. As no one in 186+ years has come forth to claim the Strachan Chiefship, it is expected the appointed Commander (Rob Strachan, Mill of Strachan) will eventually become the recognized and legal hereditary Chief of Clan Strachan.\n\nThe Clan Strachan Society in July 2012 was issued a new Grant of Arms by the Lord Lyon.  The Society is therefore recognized as an Armigerous Society, an 'indeterminant cadet' [Innes].  According to Innes, an Armigerous Clan Society as a corporate Armiger is responsible to act as the economic and business affairs arm of the clan, subordinate to the Chief.\n\n'''Armorial description of the Society Arms:'''\n\n:Azure, a hart trippant Or attired and ungulled Gules in chief three annulets conjoined in fess Or.  \n::\"Crest issuant from a celestial crown Purpure a demi-hart rampant Or attired and ungulled Gules charged with a saltire Argent and in its mouth a California Poppy Proper.\"\n\n[[File:Strach1.gif|thumbnail|right|Clan Strachan Tartan \u2013 designed in 1987, by Tony Murray. According to Kenneth Dalgliesh (Scottish World Tartan Society) it was first seen in 1999, and was registered in 2000.]]\n\n==Clan Castles==\n\n*'''Glenkindie House''': Adam Strachan was granted lands in Aberdeenshire from William Keith (1350). William Keith had inherited the barony of Strachan through his mother, the daughter of Sir Alexander Fraser and niece of King Robert I. Adam Strachan also married the niece of Thomas, [[Earl of mar|Earl of Mar]], Margaret Mar, and gained the lands and baronetcy of Glenkindie. As a result of this marriage between the Strachan of Glenkindie and the Earldom of Mar, Strachans may wear the Tribe of Mar tartan. Additionally, as the Earldom of Mar were related to the King Robert the Bruce, descendants from this marriage would no doubt have royal blood.\n*'''House of Thornton''': In 1348, seven years before Adam Strachan obtained Glenkindie, a Sir James Strachan of Monboddo married Agnete, heiress of the Barony of Thornton, which had been granted to her father by Robert I in 1309. From thenceforth, the Strachans of Thornton and the Strachans of Glenkindie became the two principal chieftains of the Strachan family. Thornton Castle lies about 15&nbsp;miles to the south of the village of Strachan and Glenkindie House lies about 30&nbsp;miles to its north.\n*'''House of Carmyllie''': Alexander de Strachan granted the barony of [[Carmylie]] in Forfarshire (1347) by [[Henry Maule|Sir Henry Maule of Panmure]]. Also received the lands of Drummayeth, Hackmangerum, Acheyclare, and Moncur.\n*'''House of Lenturk''': Sir John de Strachan was granted the barony of Lenturk in Aberdeenshire (1350 possibly by the Earl of Mar, as his lands were situated quite near to the Earl of Mar's fortress, Kildrummy Castle). In 1359, Sir John became Viscount (Sheriff) of Forfarshire. In official documents of the time, he is listed as a witness to the installation of John of Mar as Bishop of Aberdeen and, to another charter, as co-witness with William Keith, the Earl Marshall. In 1380, the granted the lands of Petgervy to his son Galfrid.\n*'''Barony of Aberdeenshire''':  ~1347, King David II himself granted to Donald de Strachan and his wife Annabel very extensive lands in Forfarshire, and a barony in Aberdeenshire.\n*'''House of Knock''':  Thomas de Strachan got the lands of Knock in Kincardineshire.\n\nIt is highly unlikely this is a coincidence, as all these grants occurred almost simultaneously, particularly as they involved marriages, and marriages amongst the nobility were typically political. It follows that there must have been some new motivation that made marriage with the Strachans politically desirable.\n\nIt is believed by historians (see \"Notes\" immediately below) that the former Baron de Strachan was one of the large numbers of pro-Balliol nobles who, after the Battle of Inverurie (1308) fled to the English court, and where they were known as \"the disinherited\". But in 1347, King David, honouring obligations under the Franco-Scottish alliance, invaded the north of England, were heavily defeated, and captured by the English. So, from the perspective of \"the disinherited\", here was the son of the man (King Robert the Bruce) who had disinherited them arriving captive in London. If one king could disinherit them, why should not another? With a little persuasion King David reinstated the Strachans, among others.\n\n==Clan Septs==\n\nThe Anglicization of the Gaelic led to different spellings of the name, as transliterations were made in various censuses: Strachan (mainly Scots), Straghan (mainly Irish), or Strahan (both) and Strawn (American).  Strachen, Strachn, Straughan, Strawhun, Straun, Strane, Stracon, Strahin, Strain, Strong, Strongman, Stronger, Strang, Stronge, Strang, Strange, Strangeman, Straughn, Strauchon, and Stranahan are also recognized derivations of Strachan.<ref name=septs>[http://www.clanstrachan.org/history/nameslist.htm Strachan Names List]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Scottish clan]]\n*[[Armigerous clan]]\n*[[Strachan, Aberdeenshire]]\n*[[Strachan Baronets]]\n*[[Strachan (disambiguation)]]\n*[http://www.clanstrachan.org/ Clan Strachan Society]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090331131639/http://www.clanstrachan.org/clan_story.htm Story of Clan Strachan]\n*Strachan, Major Benjamin, CMG.

The clan does not have a [[clan chief|chief]] now, therefore it is considered by Court of the Lord Lyon and the Stand Council of Scottish Chiefs as an [[Armigerous clan]].<ref name=history>[http://www.clanstrachan.org/history/today.htm History of Clan Strachan]</ref>\n\nClan Strachan held a Family Convention (or Ad Hoc [[Derbhfine]]) under the supervision of the Court of the Lord Lyon on 11 April 2014 in Edinburgh.  The meeting ended amicably with unanimous support for [[Rob Strachan]], Mill of Strachan, Strachan, Aberdeenshire to be recognised as [[Scottish clan chief#Recognition of Chief in Scots law|Commander]].\n\nOn 29 April 2014, Lord Lyon Dr. Joseph Morrow dispatched a letter to the Sennachie of Clan Strachan, Jim Strachan, whereas Lyon wrote, \"I have signed a Warrant authorizing the Lyon Clerk to prepare a Commission appointing Charles Robert Lund Strachan to be Commander of the Hounourable Clan Strachan for a period of 5 years.\"\n\nIn 2024, Clan Strachan hopes to hold another Strachan Family Convention to recognize Rob Strachan as Hereditary Chief of the Honourable Clan Strachan.  The [http://www.clanstrachan.org Clan Strachan Society] will be notifying its membership and those on their email lists of tentative plans as time approaches.\n\nThe Clan Strachan warcry is ''Clachnaben!''<ref name=cry>[http://www.clanstrachan.org/history/warcry.htm Clan Strachan Warcry - Clachnaben!]</ref>\n\n== Highland or Lowland Clan? ==\n\nThe [[Highland Boundary Fault]] is a geologic fault that traverses Scotland from Arran and Helensburgh on the west coast to [[Stonehaven]] in the east. It separates two distinctly different physiographic regions: the Highlands from the Lowlands, but in most places it is only recognisable as a change in topography.\n\nThe original Strachan lands and home of all Strachans ([[Strachan, Aberdeenshire]]) is located in some 15 miles northwest of [[Stonehaven]], 3 miles outside of Banchory, north and adjacent to the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. Therefore, the auld Barony of Strachan is located within the Highland Region.  These lands, including Durris, and the entire Howe O' Mearns were held under the Mormaer of the Mearns, M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns. His name means \"tonsured one of (Saint) Peter\".  One source tells us that M\u00e1el Petair was the son of a M\u00e1el Coluim. His name occurs in many sources because he was the man who, in 1094, is often credited for the murder of King Duncan II of Scotland.  Most historians agree that King Edgar, the brother and heir of Duncan II confiscated M\u00e1el Petair's mormaerdom, and converted it to crown lands. By mid-13th century, virtually all of the Mearns were converted to [[Thane (Scotland)|thanages]].\n\nAs will be seen herein,  evidence from various charters and grants suggests that Clan Strachan should most appropriately be classified (during the medieval period) as \"a Lowland Clan residing within the Highland Region\".  The Parish of Strachan was not held by the Clan in the traditional highland sense, but were occupied by the first of the name, Ranulf de Strachan (c. 1212) and his heirs until about 1315.\n\nVarious grants and charters confirm that Ranulf de Strachan was extremely loyal to the Scottish Crown and the [[House of Dunkeld]], as would be expected given the barony of Strachan was held by the Crown, and part of the Royal Demesne.   Given the cultural divide between highland and lowland peoples, in all likelihood the 'de Strachan' would have been greatly offended had anyone considered him a \"Highlander\", which in the 13th century inferred loyalty to MacDonald [[Lord of the Isles]].  During that period, Lowlanders generally considered Highlanders outlaws and traitors to the Scottish Crown.\n\nAs mentioned, one might accurately describe Clan Strachan as a Lowland Clan within the Highland Region.  This was not uncommon as, for example, the Name of [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]], [[Clan Fraser|Fraser]] and others fall within this same category.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:KincardineshireTraditional.png|thumb|left|220px|Map of Scotland showing the district of [[Kincardineshire]], where the Strachans of Thornton lived]]\n\n===Origins===\nThis surname of Strachan is local as others of the greatest antiquity and has been according to ancient custom taken from lands. (GC, ii, 265)\n\nAs the Strachan surname is considered a \"local\" or \"territorial\" name it is merely an indication of where the individual came from, and it cannot be assumed that people with the surname are necessarily ancestors.\n\nThe Village of Strachan is located some 20 miles southwest of Aberdeen, in the Royal Deeside Grampian Highlands of Scotland.\n\nThe District of Strachan is about twenty miles in length, extending from the confines of the parish of Durris, on the east; to Mount Battock, on the west; and is twelve miles in breadth, from Cairn-o'-Mount, in the south, to the river Dee, which constitutes its northern boundary, and separates it from the parish of Banchory-Ternan. It encompasses 56,362 acres.  (Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, ii, p.&nbsp;504-5)\n\nThrough the District of Strachan run the Waters of the Dye, the Avon (pronounced: /on/), and Feugh.  The first are tributaries to the latter, which falls into the Dee at Banchory-Teran, where the channel, wild and rocky, shaded by mountain pine, birch, and copsewood, presents a singularly romantic appearance. (Jervise p.&nbsp;4)\n\nThe word Strachan is an anglicized derivative with origins in the Scottish Gaelic (or 'Scottis') language.   It is derived from the Gaelic word \"strath\" meaning \"broad valley\", and \"Aven\" (pronounced /on/) which is a Gaelic word for 'river', and also the name of one of the tributaries of the Dee that runs through the Strachan District (Water of the Aven, or alternatively spelt on other maps \"Water of the Awen\").\n\nAccording to the ''Herald & Genealogist'' (vol. viii,302), Strachan means 'Vale of the Waters,' apparently due to the three main burns in the District (Waters of the Dye, Avon and Feugh).\n\nOthers suggest the Strachan surname means 'Valley of the Avon' (pronounced /on/).  If this definition is accurate, it suggests the main burn in Strachan in or about the year 1200, was the  Water of the Avon. Similarly suggesting the main medieval settlement of Strachan was located much farther to the west than where the main body of the current village is located.  Perhaps just south and west of the Mill of Strachan in the area of Little Ennochie, Balblyth, Weir or Cuttieshillock, in the District of Strachan.\n\n===Charter History of Strachan of that Ilk===\nThe lands of Strachan were granted by [[William the Lion|King William the Lion]] to William Giffard of Lethington, in the barony of Yester, in feu-tenure and in forest with permanent and hereditary rights for an annual render of 9 merks (c. 1189-95, RRS.  ii, no. 340, 410). Simply, the lands of Strachan were owned by the crown, and held 'in forest' as a royal hunting preserve. Evidence also suggests that William Giffard was succeeded by Ranulf (de Strachan) sometime between 1189-1211 (St A. Lib., 276-7), and as such Ranulf de Strachan and his heirs were direct vassals of the crown.\n\nWaltheof de Strachan succeeded Ranulf (c. 1230), and appears to have had an affinity to Fife, and granted part of the lands of Strachan to the priory of St. Andrews in Fife (St A. Lib., 276-7).\n\nIn 1230-1240, Sir Waldeve de Strachechin witnessed an undated charter which is translated as follows:  Alicia (or Alice), daughter of John, son of Ranulph, with the consent of her son and heir John, has given, granted and by this her present charter established to Blessed Queen Margaret and Dunfermline Abbey, in free, pure and perpetual alms, six acres of land with toft and croft in the villa of Cramond \u2018of the Scots\u2019 (MLO)\u2026 in free and perpetual alms.(Dunf. Reg. no 202)  Thus, it is possible, although not for certain, that Strachan of that Ilk may have been blood related to the Cramond family though the female line give the names provided in this charter.\n\nThe cartulary also suggest that Strachan of that Ilk married into the de Quincy family (c. 1196-1264), and obtained at least half the lands of Beath Waldeve (DR, no. 154; RRS, ii, no. 396; DR, no. 86).  Elizabeth de Quincy married Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan, and if this thesis is proved true, it would have made Strachan of the Ilk blood related to the Alexander and Elizabeth's son, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.\n\nIn 1264, 'R' Strachan (believed to be Ranulf de Strachan) was appointed Viscount (Sheriff) of Banffshire (a county North of Aberdeenshire) in succession of Alexander Comyn, the Earl of Buchan. (Exchequer Rolls i, p 15).  This may support the thesis that Strachan of that Ilk were related to the Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan.  Sheriffdoms were generally thought to be hereditary. (Grant. Medieval Scotland, p.&nbsp;57)\n\nin 1268, Elizabeth, Countess of Buchan, formally endorsed the appointment of Ranulph and Michael de Strachan, and William Comyn, named \u2018the Black\u2019 (probably the brother of the Earl of Badenoch and cousin of the Earl of Buchan), to receive her property on her behalf. (CDS / BAIN, i, 2509, 2513)\n\n===Wars of Independence===\nStrachan of that Ilk, holding crown lands, were no doubt beholding to the sovereign and would have supported the King of Scotland, and his heirs.  This being King John Balliol in 1292, and in 1306 would have been Red Comyn.  When Robert the Bruce murdered Red Comyn at the altar at Grayfriars Abbey, the new heir to the throne of Scotland was John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.  Strachan of that Ilk, as mentioned, was likely blood-kin of John Comyn.\n\nBruce forces likely burned-out a timber fortress in Strachan, now called Castlehill of Strachan during the early summer of 1308 (Yeoman).  Comyn, and his loyal supporters which likely included Clan Strachan, were defeated at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1308)]].  After the Battle of Bannockburn (1314), the Strachans were disinherited by Robert the Bruce and the lands of Strachan were granted to Sir Alexander Fraser, thane of Cowie (1316).\n\nBefore 1325, Alexander Strachan, son and heir of John Strachan of that Ilk, and his wife Christina, daughter of Maule of Panmure, was granted by Maule all his land of Carmyllie, his whole land of Drumnadych, his whole land of Hacwrangdrom, half his land of Lochlair, the mill, the grain, Strathyis Copresille (ANG) \u2026 with all their just pertinents, correct bounds, etc.\n\nThe battle of Neville\u2019s Cross took place to the west of Durham, England, on 17 October 1346.  King David of Scotland \u2013 son and heir of Robert the Bruce \u2013 was wounded in the face by two arrows, and eventually captured.  Both Alexander Strachan (spelt Straghern) and his son died fighting alongside of the Earl of Buchan, and all of whom serving in the same division under the direct command of King David of Scotland. (Sir Herbert Maxwell, The Chronicle of Lanercost, 1913, page 339)\n\nAround 1350, many of the families that benefited from Robert the Bruce confiscations and disinheritance rushed to make amends with promises of noble marriages and grants of land.  During this period, five new Houses of Strachan were formed... Knock, Glenkindie, Thornton, Lenturk, and a barony in Aberdeenshire.\n\n===17th-18th century: Civil war and a split in family loyalties===\nSir Alexander Strachan of Thornton obtained the Baronet of Nova Scotia from King Charles I in 1625. The baronetcy passed to a distant relative, Sir James Strachan of Inchtuthill.

Adam Strachan also married the niece of Thomas, [[Earl of mar|Earl of Mar]], Margaret Mar, and gained the lands and baronetcy of Glenkindie. As a result of this marriage between the Strachan of Glenkindie and the Earldom of Mar, Strachans may wear the Tribe of Mar tartan. Additionally, as the Earldom of Mar were related to the King Robert the Bruce, descendants from this marriage would no doubt have royal blood.\n*'''House of Thornton''': In 1348, seven years before Adam Strachan obtained Glenkindie, a Sir James Strachan of Monboddo married Agnete, heiress of the Barony of Thornton, which had been granted to her father by Robert I in 1309. From thenceforth, the Strachans of Thornton and the Strachans of Glenkindie became the two principal chieftains of the Strachan family. Thornton Castle lies about 15&nbsp;miles to the south of the village of Strachan and Glenkindie House lies about 30&nbsp;miles to its north.\n*'''House of Carmyllie''': Alexander de Strachan granted the barony of [[Carmylie]] in Forfarshire (1347) by [[Henry Maule|Sir Henry Maule of Panmure]]. Also received the lands of Drummayeth, Hackmangerum, Acheyclare, and Moncur.\n*'''House of Lenturk''': Sir John de Strachan was granted the barony of Lenturk in Aberdeenshire (1350 possibly by the Earl of Mar, as his lands were situated quite near to the Earl of Mar's fortress, Kildrummy Castle). In 1359, Sir John became Viscount (Sheriff) of Forfarshire. In official documents of the time, he is listed as a witness to the installation of John of Mar as Bishop of Aberdeen and, to another charter, as co-witness with William Keith, the Earl Marshall. In 1380, the granted the lands of Petgervy to his son Galfrid.\n*'''Barony of Aberdeenshire''':  ~1347, King David II himself granted to Donald de Strachan and his wife Annabel very extensive lands in Forfarshire, and a barony in Aberdeenshire.\n*'''House of Knock''':  Thomas de Strachan got the lands of Knock in Kincardineshire.\n\nIt is highly unlikely this is a coincidence, as all these grants occurred almost simultaneously, particularly as they involved marriages, and marriages amongst the nobility were typically political. It follows that there must have been some new motivation that made marriage with the Strachans politically desirable.\n\nIt is believed by historians (see \"Notes\" immediately below) that the former Baron de Strachan was one of the large numbers of pro-Balliol nobles who, after the Battle of Inverurie (1308) fled to the English court, and where they were known as \"the disinherited\". But in 1347, King David, honouring obligations under the Franco-Scottish alliance, invaded the north of England, were heavily defeated, and captured by the English. So, from the perspective of \"the disinherited\", here was the son of the man (King Robert the Bruce) who had disinherited them arriving captive in London. If one king could disinherit them, why should not another? With a little persuasion King David reinstated the Strachans, among others.\n\n==Clan Septs==\n\nThe Anglicization of the Gaelic led to different spellings of the name, as transliterations were made in various censuses: Strachan (mainly Scots), Straghan (mainly Irish), or Strahan (both) and Strawn (American).  Strachen, Strachn, Straughan, Strawhun, Straun, Strane, Stracon, Strahin, Strain, Strong, Strongman, Stronger, Strang, Stronge, Strang, Strange, Strangeman, Straughn, Strauchon, and Stranahan are also recognized derivations of Strachan.<ref name=septs>[http://www.clanstrachan.org/history/nameslist.htm Strachan Names List]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Scottish clan]]\n*[[Armigerous clan]]\n*[[Strachan, Aberdeenshire]]\n*[[Strachan Baronets]]\n*[[Strachan (disambiguation)]]\n*[http://www.clanstrachan.org/ Clan Strachan Society]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090331131639/http://www.clanstrachan.org/clan_story.htm Story of Clan Strachan]\n*Strachan, Major Benjamin, CMG.
