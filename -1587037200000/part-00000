It has also been isolated from ''[[Mucor]] ramannianus'' and ''[[Isaria]] kogana''. The drug is licensed for use as its [[sodium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] '''sodium fusidate''', and it is approved for use under prescription in South Korea, Japan, Canada, the EU, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, India and Taiwan.

Resistance is defined as an MIC of 2&nbsp;mg/l or more.  In laboratories using disc diffusion methods, susceptibility for a 2.5&nbsp;\u00b5g disc is defined as a zone of 22&nbsp;mm or more, and resistance is defined as a zone of 17&nbsp;mm or less; intermediate values are defined as intermediate resistance.  These susceptibility criteria are based on lower dosing regimens used outside of the U.S.  Clinical trials in the U.S. incorporate a different dosing regimen that results in higher blood levels.  Therefore, the U.S. dosing regimen may warrant different susceptibility criteria.\n\nMechanisms of resistance have been extensively studied only in ''Staphylococcus aureus''.  The most important mechanism is the development of point mutations in ''fusA'', the chromosomal gene that codes for EF-G.  The mutation alters EF-G so that fusidic acid is no longer able to bind to it.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Turnidge J, Collignon P | title=Resistance to fusidic acid\n| year=1999\n| journal=Int J Antimicrob Agents\n| volume=12\n| issue=Suppl 2\n| pages=S35&ndash;44|doi=10.1016/S0924-8579(98)00072-7\n| pmid=10528785\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Besier S, Ludwig A, Brade V, Wichelhaus TA | title=Molecular analysis of fusidic acid resistance in ''Staphylococcus aureus''\n| year=2003\n| journal=Mol Microbiol\n| volume=47\n| pages=463&ndash;9|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03307.x\n| pmid=12519196\n| issue=2\n}}</ref>  Resistance is readily acquired when fusidic acid is used alone and commonly develops during the course of treatment.

Resistance is defined as an MIC of 2&nbsp;mg/l or more.  In laboratories using disc diffusion methods, susceptibility for a 2.5&nbsp;\u00b5g disc is defined as a zone of 22&nbsp;mm or more, and resistance is defined as a zone of 17&nbsp;mm or less; intermediate values are defined as intermediate resistance.  These susceptibility criteria are based on lower dosing regimens used outside of the U.S.  Clinical trials in the U.S. incorporate a different dosing regimen that results in higher blood levels.  Therefore, the U.S. dosing regimen may warrant different susceptibility criteria.\n\nMechanisms of resistance have been extensively studied only in ''Staphylococcus aureus''.  The most important mechanism is the development of point mutations in ''fusA'', the chromosomal gene that codes for EF-G.  The mutation alters EF-G so that fusidic acid is no longer able to bind to it.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Turnidge J, Collignon P | title=Resistance to fusidic acid\n| year=1999\n| journal=Int J Antimicrob Agents\n| volume=12\n| issue=Suppl 2\n| pages=S35&ndash;44|doi=10.1016/S0924-8579(98)00072-7\n| pmid=10528785\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Besier S, Ludwig A, Brade V, Wichelhaus TA | title=Molecular analysis of fusidic acid resistance in ''Staphylococcus aureus''\n| year=2003\n| journal=Mol Microbiol\n| volume=47\n| pages=463&ndash;9|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03307.x\n| pmid=12519196\n| issue=2\n}}</ref>  Resistance is readily acquired when fusidic acid is used alone and commonly develops during the course of treatment.

On 27 May 1970 [[Don Whillans]] and [[Dougal Haston]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna I]] which at {{convert|26545|ft}} is the highest peak in the [[Annapurna Massif]] in [[Nepal]]. [[Chris Bonington]] led the expedition which approached up a glacier from the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] and then used rock climbing techniques to put [[fixed rope]]s up the steep South Face. Although the plan had been to use supplementary oxygen, in the event it was not possible to carry any cylinders high enough for the lead climbers to use on their summit bid.\n\nLow down on the mountain, on 30 May as the expedition was about to leave, [[Ian Clough]] was killed by a falling [[serac]]. Several members of the expedition rose to fame in Britain, and as a whole the expedition received international recognition in mountaineering circles on account of its innovative and extremely difficult nature.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Annapurna ===\n{{see also|Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal}}\nThe [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna massif]] is in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]a region of Nepal where for over one hundred years the ruling [[Rana dynasty]]  had not allowed explorers or mountaineers to enter the country.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=238\u2013241}}{{sfnp|Ward|Clark|1992}} In 1950 Nepal at last gave permission for the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]], to attempt [[Dhaulagiri]] or [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna I]], the two highest peaks in the Annapurna region. The expedition, led by [[Maurice Herzog]], mounted a successful summit attempt via the North Face. For most Himalayan mountains the easiest route to the summit is along a ridge route but for Annapurna the North Face is not too steep (though it is very exposed to avalanches) and the route subsequently turned out to be the easiest.{{sfnp|Herzog|1954|pp=48,54,57,102\u2013103}}{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=242\u2013253,387}} Although it was the first climbed of the eight-thousanders, Annapurna is not often climbed and there is a high death rate among those attempting it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Voiland |title=The Eight-Thousanders |url=https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/8000MeterPeaks |website=www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2013 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503184334/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Start of rock climbing in Himalaya ===\nAfter years of stagnation between the wars, British rock climbing underwent a renaissance, particularly with working-class climbing clubs starting up in the north of England and Scotland. The [[Rock and Ice Club]] in [[Manchester]], the Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club in [[Glasgow]] and several university climbing clubs were amongst those that engendered a highly competitive climbing environment. At [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] in Wales numerous routes of a very high standard were achieved using strictly [[free climbing]] techniques. [[Hamish MacInnes]] and [[Dougal Haston]], although not members, climbed with Creagh Dhu and MacInnes had mentored [[Chris Bonington]]'s youthful climbing as early as 1953.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nIn 1960, Bonington, as a member of a joint British\u2013Indian\u2013Nepalese army team led by [[J. O. M. Roberts|Jimmy Roberts]], reached the summit of the {{convert|26039|ft|adj=on}} [[Annapurna II]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of the range's main summit, Annapurna I. The route did not involve rock climbing.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=347,387}}\n\n[[Mount Everest]] was ascended in 1963 by an American team along [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1963|a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=387}}  Two years later, when planning with the American [[John Harlin]] for Harlin's ''direttissima'' attempt on the [[Eigerwand|North Face of the Eiger]], Harlin introduced Bonington to the American [[Big wall climbing|big wall]] technique of directly ascending a [[fixed rope]] using [[Jumar]]s.{{sfnp|Harlin|2008|pp=109\u2013111}} Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and [[Mick Burke (mountaineer)|Mick Burke]] who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=246}} The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=231}} From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8000-metre peaks]] climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nEncouraged by Roberts, Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing [[Annapurna]] by its South Face which he realised was going to require not just rock climbing but also [[Expedition style|siege climbing tactics]] because the ascent would take many weeks. No one had tried rock climbing at high altitude before. The face itself was almost twice as high as the {{convert|6000|ft}} [[Eigerwand]] and even above the rock band there was another {{convert|3000|ft}} to the summit.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971b|p=18\u201333}}{{sfnp|Bonington|2017|p=155}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}  The topography near the summit could be assessed from photographs Bonington had taken on the Annapurna II expedition of ten years earlier.{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=411}}\n\n===Planning===\n{{external media|topic=Clip from TV programme|Annapurna|title=Annapurna South Face|headerimage=|caption=\n|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQE_65nk_p4 Annapurna: The Hardest Way Up]{{sfnp|Edwards|1971}}}}\nWith financial support for the expedition from the [[Mount Everest Foundation]], Bonington assembled a team from amongst his friends: [[Nick Estcourt]], [[Martin Boysen]], [[Ian Clough]], Mike Thompson, Burke and Haston. Advised to include an American to boost sales of the book he was planning, Bonington appointed [[Tom Frost]] who had considerable [[big wall]] experience in [[Yosemite]] as well as \u2013 secretly at the time \u2013 [[Nanda Devi]] on a [[Nanda Devi#CIA mission|CIA mission]] to install a nuclear-powered listening device for monitoring [[China and weapons of mass destruction|Chinese missiles]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}} Frost was known to and respected by Haston and [[Don Whillans]]. Whillans was to be deputy leader for, although by then he was an overweight heavy drinker and smoker who disliked Bonington, he had more Himalayan experience than any other British mountaineer still active.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=389\u2013390}} Indeed, only he, Bonington and Clough had been to Himalaya at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1986|p=16}} Also included as climbers were [[Kelvin Kent (mountaineer)|Kelvin Kent]], base camp manager, and David Lambert, the doctor. A four-man television team from [[ITN]] and [[Thames Television]] was to be accompanying them.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=414}}\n\n===Departure===\nThey took {{convert|18000|ft}} of rope for fixing (they did not use their climbing rope), 40 cylinders of Oxygen and six breathing sets.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=246,257}} The baggage was sent from London by sea with Whillans and Lambert flying to [[Bombay]]{{refn|group=note|[[Mumbai]] is the present name.}} to see to its unloading and transport to [[Pokhara]] by lorry. However, the ship was then delayed by about three weeks so Bonington arranged for Whillans and Lambert to travel to [[Kathmandu]] to reconnoitre the approach route instead of waiting at Bombay, and Clough would go to Bombay to deal with the baggage.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29\u201331,39}} They took oxygen cylinders intending to use supplementary oxygen above about {{convert|22500|ft}} but it was very little used for climbing and not at all above Camp VI. It was used, however, for people who had become ill.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=257\u2013259}}\n\n==Expedition==\n===March-in and Base Camp===\n[[File:1970 Annapurna south face expedition approach route.svg|thumb|Approach route from [[Pokhara]] to Annapurna Base Camp]]\nIn March 1970 the expedition flew to Kathmandu and then on to [[Pokhara]] from where the trek to the southern vicinity of Annapurna was along an easy route. Unlike twenty years earlier when [[Maurice Herzog|Herzog]] had no satisfactory map and had to pioneer a route, by 1970 the track was well known even to [[hippie]] wanderers.{{refn|group=note|The eight-day trek route from Pokhara went up beside the [[Seti Gandaki River|Seti Khola]] river and then the Modi Khola (a tributary of the [[Gandaki river]]). Bonington notes passing through [[Naudanda]], [[Lumle]], Chondracot (now Chandrakot), Ghandrung (now [[Ghandruk]]), Chomro (now Chhomrong), Thomo and Hinko Cave.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=47\u201350,54,79}}}} Another change was that the Sherpas were no longer unsophisticated peasants \u2013 they were smart in appearance, spoke good English and had a Western attitude. [[Pasang Kami]], the sirdar, treated the sahibs as equals and this was reciprocated. The other Sherpas were Pemba Tharkay, Ang Pema, Mingma Tsering, Nima Tsering and Kancha. As it turned out, a group from the British Army Mountaineering Association, led by [[Henry Day (colonel)|Henry Day]], was setting off at the same time for an ascent on Herzog's north face route and they had greatly helped Bonington by flying out {{convert|1500|lb}} of baggage to supply him until his main baggage arrived.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=390\u2013391}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29,39,43,238}}{{sfnp|Day|1971|p=89}}\n\nOn 16 March Whillans, Thompson and two Sherpas went ahead of the main parties to reconnoitre the route and to find a suitable place for the base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=38\u201339}} A temporary location was found to be at the entrance to the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] at the location of a previous base camp: that of the 1957 expedition to [[Machapuchare]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=18,51}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=416}}\nThe slower-moving baggage train of 140 porters set off from Pokhara on 22 March and Clough with his 240 porters was able to leave Bombay with the delayed baggage on 24 March.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=42,53,81}}\n\nBonington and Whillans met up on 27 March and Whillans said he thought he and his Sherpas had seen a [[yeti]] and had photographed the footprints. More significantly, he had been able to identify a climbing route up the mountain's south face.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=56\u201362,68, ill 10}} After the whole party has gathered at the temporary base camp on 29 March an advance party including Whillans, Haston and Burke established a final base camp at {{convert|14000|ft}} three miles from the foot of the face.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=391}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=42}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=417}} Estcourt used a theodolite to make accurate altitude measurements of various points on the face because foreshortening makes estimation inaccurate. The porters returned to Pokhara from where many of them would help move up to Base Camp the main baggage being carried from Bombay by the party led by Clough, Thompson and Kent. Meanwhile, the lead climbers and Sherpas were left to ferry the advance baggage up to the final Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=62\u201366}} The monsoon was due at bbout the end of May.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=166,195}}\n\n===Climbing route===\n[[File:1970 Annapurna south face expedition climbing route.png|thumb|Climbing route up South Face]]\nBetween Camp III at {{convert|20100|ft}} and the top of the Rock Band at {{convert|24750|ft}} the average slope is 55\u00b0.{{refn|group=note|Bonington compares this with 44\u00b0 on the [[Aiguille de la Brenva|Brenva face]] of [[Mont Blanc]] and 61\u00b0 on the Walker Spur of the [[Grandes Jorasses]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=237}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=236\u2013237}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Locations of camps on mountain\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Camp\n! colspan=\"2\" | Altitude\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupied{{refn|group=note|Dates of occupation{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=233}} unless noted otherwise.}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Description\n|-\n!  feet{{refn|group=note|Altitudes{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=237}} unless noted otherwise.}} !! metres{{refn|group=note|Altitudes in metres calculated from referenced figures in feet.}}\n|-\n| Temporary Base || 12,000{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|loc=plate 12}} || {{convert|12000|ft|disp=number}} || 28&nbsp;March<br />{{refn|group=note|Date of occupation by main party;  for advance party \u2013 21 March.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=51}}}} || sited at Base Camp of 1957 Machapuchare expedition{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=18,60}}\n|-\n| Base || 14,000 || {{convert|14000|ft|disp=number}} || 31 March{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=66}} || side of Annapurna glacier{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=60}}\n|-\n| Camp I || 16,000 || {{convert|16000|ft|disp=number}} || 2 April || on [[Nunatak|\"rognon\"]] (island of rock in glacier){{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=64}}\n|-\n| Camp II || 17,500 || {{convert|17500|ft|disp=number}} || 6 April || under rock overhang{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=76}}\n|-\n| Camp III || 20,100 || {{convert|20100|ft|disp=number}} || 13 April || large, flat area at Col{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=85}}\n|-\n| Camp IV || 21,300 || {{convert|21300|ft|disp=number}} || 23 April || sloping 30\u00b0  on Ice Ridge{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109,111}}\n|-\n| dump || 21,650{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,236}} || {{convert|21650|ft|disp=number}} || 11 May || col at top of Ice Ridge{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=139\u2013140,154,236}}\n|-\n| temporary<br /> Camp&nbsp;V || 22,500<br />{{refn|group=note|8,500 feet above Base Camp at 14,000 feet.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=147,237}}}} || {{convert|22500|ft|disp=number}} || 6 May{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=141}} || foot of Ice Wall, vulnerable to snow sliding from above{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=141}}\n|-\n| Camp V || 22,750 || {{convert|22750|ft|disp=number}} || 9 May || [[bergschrund]] at foot of Rock Band{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149,152}}\n|-\n| Camp VI || 24,000 || {{convert|24000|ft|disp=number}} || 19 May || tiny platform carved in snow at top of Flat Iron{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=194}}\n|-\n| Summit || 26,545 || {{convert|26545|ft|disp=number}} || 27 May ||\n|}\n\n===To Camp III and abortive start up Ice Ridge===\nWhillans and Haston had found a difficult route across the glacier and up to a [[Nunatak|rognon]] \u2013 an island of rock on a glacier \u2013 where Camp I was planned to be and then reached the flattish top of the rognon where Camp I would be just far enough away from the face \u2013 about a mile away \u2013 to avoid avalanche danger. Bonington and Burke relocated the lower part of the route hoping to make it suitable for porters.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe ridge they were to use at the start of the climb was straightforwardly approached across the glacier but steep cliff barred the way onto the ridge itself so they skirted these on the right to reach a site for Camp II, lower than hoped for but with nowhere suitable immediately higher. For a short distance the route was seriously threatened by an ice overhang which they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" but they decided to reduce the risk by moving under it as quickly as possible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=73\u201377}}\n\nWhen he arrived with the main baggage Clough was supposed to stop at Hinko Cave overnight on 7 April but, due to confusing instructions, with his entourage of 240 porters he continued on in a snowstorm to temporary base camp some miles further on. Some porters had refused to go beyond Hinko Cave and the rest, overloaded and without adequate clothes and shoes in the bad weather, variously got into states of anger and collapse. However, now the main gear had arrived, it was possible to sort out shelter under cover for the night and provide medical help when necessary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=79\u201381}} On this same day Whillans and Haston had reached the Ice Ridge at a col where Camp III was to be established. They had to climb through deep snow in bad weather. In ten days the expedition had got from the Sanctuary to half height on the face, although with the difficult climbing all to be done further ahead. They [[abseil]]ed down to Camp II from where, next day, they started placing fixed ropes towards the col.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nOn 11 March Boysen and Estcourt established Camp III on the col, where there were to be two Whillans Box tents at a spacious location, free from risk of avalanches or falling rocks.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=85,98}} The version used on Annapurna, designed by Whillans, was [[cuboid]] in shape, {{convert|6.5|x|4.0|x|4|ft}}, made of socketed aluminium tubes covered in nylon top and bottom and cotton-[[terylene]] at the sides. It was strengthened with nylon webbing straps and at one end was a nylon-zipped entrance. An inner nylon tent was available but not always used. It weighed {{convert|30|lb}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison the nylon tents of a hooped design, Bonington calls them RAFMA tents, weighed only {{convert|10|lb}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=251}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=66\u201367,249\u2013250}}\n\nOn 12 April, after Bonington had organised the logistics of getting Base Camp fully set up and equipped, he and Frost set from there so that on 14 April they could start to prospect a route up the Ice Ridge above Camp III. After investigating a snow shelf leading to a gully on the west of the ridge, Bonington decided avalanches posed too great a threat so he joined Frost who was ascending along the actual crest of the ridge. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than they had expected with snow too soft and loose for firm [[piton]] placements and there would be a need to set [[fixed rope]]s all the way up the ridge. Also, they had not formed a plan for placing fixed ropes \u2013 should the lead climber fix his rope or should he climb normally leaving the second climber to pay out a rope from his rucksack, fixing it as he climbed? To begin with the latter method seemed more successful but progress was dreadfully slow with Bonington never having previously encountered such appalling snow.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=86\u201391}} Later in the expedition the technique changed and they climbed using their {{convert|9|mm|adj=on}} fixed rope which they then secured with pitons and [[karabiner]]s, not using their {{convert|11|mm|adj=on}} climbing rope at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=247}}\n\nThat night at Camp III they discussed their religious beliefs \u2013 Bonington was a sceptic and Frost a [[Morman]]. Bonington wrote to his wife \"He is a convinced and fervent Mormon, never rams it down your throat, yet his faith has given him a code of conduct that puts him way out in front of most of us\". Next day it was straightforward to re-climb their fixed rope but again onward climbing was extremely difficult. On the previous day and this one Whillans and Haston had been ferrying supplies from Camp II up to Camp III and following their second climb they starting exploring the shelf which Bonington had investigated previously beside the ridge. Here they made such good progress that the pair on the ridge needed little persuasion to abandon  entirely their efforts on the lowest part of the ridge.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=91\u201395}}\n\nNext day all four climbers set off along the shelf with Haston breaking trail and never surrendering the lead. The avalanche risk was considerable even though they kept their distance from the ridge and matters got worse as they reached the gully threatened by avalanches from ice cliffs thousands of feet above and by [[Snow cornice|cornices]] on the ridge itself. They decided to avoid the gully by climbing a minor [[ar\u00eate]] which led from the foot of the gully up to a high point on the main ridge but they had to leave a [[deadman anchor]] when deteriorating weather forced them to retreat to camp. Next day Bonington and Frost got within {{convert|50|ft}} of the crest of the Ice Ridge but again bad weather forced a retreat.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=95\u201399}}\n\nBy 18 April only {{convert|1000|ft}} had been gained since the Col had been reached eleven days earlier and from Base Camp and on 19 April Haston again ascended the minor ar\u00eate where the way to the main ridge was blocked by huge cornices but he found he could slip through gaps in the rotten snow between the wall of the ridge and one of the cornices. However, after reaching the crest of main ridge and fixing a rope he was forced back by the weather. At last, two days later, he was able to reach the Ice Ridge and find an ideal place for Camp IV.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=102\u2013109}}\n\nThe expedition was unexpectedly enhanced when four trekkers \u2013 the Sherpas called them the \"London Sherpas\" \u2013 turned up at Base Camp completely unexpectedly.{{refn|group=note|The trekkers had left [[Essex]] in England in 1969 in a [[Land Rover]], planning to climb in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Delayed in Austria they had spent the winter in Afghanistan and then had driven to Kathmandu, flown to Pokhara, trekked over to the foothills of [[Dhaulagiri]] and crossed to Chomro via the Deroli Pass intending to reach the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=109}} The Deroli Pass, now more usually referred to as the [[Deurali Pass]], is on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] trail, near [[Ghorepani]] and [[Poon Hill]].}} In return for \"board and lodging\" the two men helped carry loads even as high as Camp IV and the women helped at Base Camp where Bonington thought their presence engendered a more a civilised and relaxed air. Other trekkers also turned up to get a grandstand view of the climb and to help carrying loads.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Camp IV to Camp V on the Rock Band===\nBoysen, Estcourt, Haston and Whillans worked together establishing Camp IV but the situation at Camp III became critical after several attempts to supply it from Camp II had failed because of deep snow and avalanches. Eventually an overnight carry was successful and in general it seemed the snow conditions improved the higher one got up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=110\u2013114}}\n\nBoysen and Estcourt tackled the upper part of the Ice Ridge above Camp IV which was very narrow with cornices to the left but solid rock on the right. At one point Boysen's progress was blocked except for a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tunnel which he could clamber through, without his rucksack, as if potholing. The tunnel led not further up the ridge but out onto an ice cliff with a {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} drop to the glacier. However, he managed to climb onto and up the cliff despite the drag of his climbing rope passing along a highly contorted route behind him. When he reached safety he had let out {{convert|150|ft}} of rope in ascending only {{convert|50|ft}}. It was the most difficult ice climb Boysen had ever done. There was no direct way for Estcourt to ascend to Boysen's stance so he had to repeat the circuitous climb. Boysen's next lead again went on to a traverse, which was later called the \"Terrible Traverse\", which he was not able to complete before descending to Camp IV for the night. They had spent all day climbing {{convert|300|ft}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=115\u2013119,125}} Next day it again proved impossible to keep to the crest of the ridge but a descent on the right to solid rock gave access to an ice-covered rock wall leading upwards. This climb had to be without the rope being secured with pitons because the rope would have jammed along its contorted route. They regained the ridge again only some {{convert|50|ft}} higher than they had reached the previous day. The following day they extended their route slightly further. After that they had to go down to recover from exhaustion but the fixed ropes they had left allowed everyone following to take a direct line though one that was neither safe nor easy.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=119\u2013121,125}}\n\nBonington and Clough took over the work of extending the route, reaching Camp IV on 27 April. Sometimes they advanced only {{convert|10|ft}} in an hour.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=123\u2013128}} At Whillans' suggestion, they arranged for Sherpas to carry all the climbers'supplies up to Camp III so that when climbers went down to rest they only needed to go to Camp III rather than Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=128}} After a few very difficult days, and without being able to regain the crest of the Ice Ridge at a higher point, Clough went down to be replaced by Haston. On 3 May Whillans, Frost and Burke carried a box tent up to Camp IV while Bonington and Haston with very difficult ice climbing reached a col at {{convert|21650|ft}} where the Ice Ridge terminates to be replaced by a snow slope leading up to the Ice Wall.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=124\u2013141}} Next day they carried a load of ropes to the col and Haston ran out {{convert|500|ft}} of rope towards the Ice Wall. At {{convert|22350|ft}} the slope suddenly changes from 45\u00b0 to vertical and this point was planned to become Camp V{{refn|group=note|The site turned out to be very poor so the camp here was only temporary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=149}}}} where a {{convert|18|lb|adj=on}} hooped tent was set up, capable of sleeping three. Supplying as high as here was a logistical problem because it took at least five days for anything to arrive from base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141,251}}\n\nSupported by Frost and Burke, Whillans and Haston established Camp V but that night spindrift  inundated the site and the tent so they decided to find a better camp location. Next day they explored the Ice Wall finding a \"gangway\" leading to the top of the Ice Wall and the foot of the Rock Band. At this point the overhang of the [[bergschrund]], although threatening, provided excellent shelter so they proposed moving Camp V to this point. On 9 May Frost and Burke established the camp at the new, higher location.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141\u2013153}} The climb from Camp IV to V was very long and difficult so two intermediate dumps{{refn|group=note|The lower of the dumps was at the top of the Ice Ridge and the other was at the original site for Camp V at the bottom of the Ice Wall.}} for supplies were used with carrying being done in shorter sections from above and below.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149\u2013150,154,178}}\n\n===Above Camp V===\n[[File:Tom Frost - South Face of Annapurna - 1970.jpg|thumb|Photograph by Frost: Boysen descending to Camp IV after carrying supplies up to Camp V.]]\nFrost and Burke started on the Rock Band which sloped at about 50\u00b0{{refn|group=note|Bonington likens this to the Second Ice Field on the [[Nordwand|North face of the Eiger]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=160}}}} Instead of taking the most direct line up a groove leading straight upwards, they cut over to the left aiming for the \"Flat Iron\", named after the similar-looking feature on the Eiger, with Burke doing the lead climbing. The good weather helped with the climbing but because of the thaw they were bombarded  from above by falling rocks. The climbers Further down the mountain were having to rest through illness or exhaustion so shortages of rope, oxygen, tents, food and fuel built up towards Camp V. On 12 May Burke and Frost made more progress but only through taking serious risks with inadequate piton placements but when they turned back for the day a storm hit them and their tent was almost buried. Fortunately by that time fresh supplies had arrived from lower camps.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154\u2013172}}\n\nBonington's general plan had been to pair off the leading climbers and to share the work of the pairs equitably by having periods of rest, carrying supplies to higher camps and extending the route. The Sherpas were carrying higher up the mountain than expected and other trekkers with climbing experience had turned up by chance and helped out. However at the higher camps things were not going so well and so on 13 May Bonington decided that when Frost and Burke came down to be rested they would be replaced by Whillans and Haston. In fact it was the turn of Estcourt and Boysen to force the route upwards but they had been working hard doing carrying while Whillans and Haston were rested. Over the radio between various camps some of the adversely affected climbers complained but were accepting it after Bonington agreed for Whillans and Haston to do a single carry before rotating into the lead. Whillans then started criticising Burke and Frost for making very slow progress on the Rock Band and so, to curtail the increasing bitterness, the radio call was ended leaving each pair to plan the detail of their newly assigned roles.{{refn|group=note|Bonington did not think Whillans' criticisms were at all fair. Indeed Burke and Frost has worked hard and made good progress.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=182}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=173\u2013180}}\n\nOn their last day in the lead Burke and Frost, possibly goaded by the criticism, managed to fix ropes up all the way to the Flat Iron. Burke had been on the face for 28 days, and Frost only slightly less \u2013 Bonington thought Burke's climb had been on the most exacting rock of the entire expedition. When Frost met Bonington down at Camp II he firmly told him he thought the stab in the back of Estcourt and Boysen had wrecked the morale of the expedition \u2013 all the same he maintained his close relationship with Bonington.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=180\u2013184}}\n\nOn 17 May Boysen, Whillans and Haston carried equipment to the top of the Flat Iron to a suitable site for Camp VI but on the way Boysen had to return to camp to recover. Whillans and Haston found a site for Camp VI but that night at Camp V the ridge tent was crushed with an avalanche of snow so Estcourt and Haston went down to the upper dump to collect the one intended for Camp VII and to get more food. Climbing back to Camp VI on 19 May, Haston's rucksack, containing his personal gear and food for Camp VI, fell down the mountain. So, that night, Whillans was alone at Camp VII with no food after the others had descended. Estcourt was alone at Camp V and so Bonington went up there to help him support the lead team. The climb from there to Camp VI was even more tiring and Bonington scarcely managed the {convert|200|ft|adj=on}} [[jumar]] climb near the top. However, he managed and even took the time on his way down to relocate the dangling rope and place further [[piton]]s on this [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] of the climb. As for oxygen, there were only three bottles at Camp V and another three at the upper dump. There was hardly any food or rope at Camp VI.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,185\u2013195}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=205\u2013209}}\n\nOn 20 May Haston returned to Camp VI where Whillans had been without food for over twenty-four hours. Bonington carried up there more food and a radio but had to dump the rope slightly below the camp. Camp VI was a terrible place \u2013 the tent was too large to fit on the ledge so Whillans and Haston had to sleep lying across the width of the tent. Also, the wind was severe and it was only held by two tent pegs, a rope over the top, and the weight of the climbers.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=209\u2013209}} The same day Estcourt carried the oxygen bottles up to Camp V from the upper dump and the lead climbers climbed {{convert|400|ft}} up from Camp VI but they were then out of food and rope and had no tent to pitch for Camp VII which they intended to place at the top of the Rock Band. They heard news that the army team on the other side of the mountain had reached the summit using a similar route to that of the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|French expedition in 1950]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\nOn 22 May Bonington and Estcourt headed up with supplies and oxygen cylinders towards Camp VI but Estcourt had to retreat back and Bonington, who was using supplementary oxygen, had to abandon the tent and oxygen ''en route''. Haston and Whillans had reached the top of the \"mini rock band\" at the top of the Rock Band but, with no rope left, they had needed to climb without protection, leaving only about {{convert|1500|ft}} to the summit, they estimated.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=200\u2013202}} They had reached the {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} snowfield above the Rock Band but without a tent or food. Next day Bonington carried tent, cin\u00e9 camera and food up from V to VI but he had needed to abandon his personal gear so he had to turn down an offer to join then on a summit attempt, Bonington and so had to go down again but the tent could be carried up next day to be left on the snow field above Camp VI. On 23 May with insufficient rope and no tent for Camp VII, the lead climbers took a rest day.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=212\u2013216,224}}\n\nIn terrible conditions on 24 May Bonington and Clough managed a carry to Camp VI but found Haston and Whillans had been forced back there so all four climbers had to spend the night together in the two-man tent. Bonington and Clough got back to Camp IV but once there the weather became impossible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\n===Summit===\nFor the next two days the entire mountain was snowbound and it seemed the monsoon had arrived but on 27 May 1970 at Camp VI there was an improvement in the weather. Leaving Camp VI about 07:00, without supplementary oxygen because they had none, Whillans and Haston reached the snow field at 11:00 from where they could see the summit through breaks in the cloud. They agreed to move the tent up to establish a camp at a higher location but they really had a more ambitious goal for the day. Indeed, any camp would be entirely lacking food or sleeping bags. They were faced with an ice plateau leading to a snow ridge and then an {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} cliff of mixed ice and rock rising up to the top of the mountain. They abandoned the tent at the foot of the ridge and climbed on without [[belay]]s. Neither climber had any difficulty with breathing.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\nThe last fifty feet of the ice cliff was vertical though there were good holds and as they reached the northern side of the mountain the wind dropped. They could see traces of army boot footprints but the flag that had been left a week earlier by the army expedition had blown away. Haston took a cin\u00e9 film of Whillans reaching the summit and then they swapped places. From the top, which they reached at 14:30 and stayed for about 10 minutes, they could see the other two Annapurna summits but nothing more. With no feeling of exhilaration, which they knew would come later. They had {{convert|150|ft}} of rope which, after they had abseiled down, was all there was left on the summit. By 17:00 they had managed the difficult descent to Camp VI.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Day|2010|p=188}}{{sfnp|Frost|1971|p=232}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=427}}\n\nLower down the mountain everyone had been completely stormbound but Bonington, having been confined to Camp IV, put in his routine 17:00 radio call asking Haston if they had been able to get out of their camp. Due to static on the radio he did not hear the reply \"Aye, we've just climbed Annapurna\" but this was heard load and clear at Base Camp and the news spread rapidly up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=204}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|p=219}}\n\n===Leaving the mountain===\nBurke and Frost wanted to make their own attempt on the summit and, contrary to his better judgement, Bonington agreed subject to the clearing of the camps proceeding at the same time. So on 28 May, Burke and Frost while Whillans and Haston descended, reaching Camp III at midday. Everyone was very excited but were held back by their British formality. Only by evening did Frost and Burke reach Camp VI. On 29 May they made their attempt but Burke had to turn back and Frost, having reached the snowfield, stayed there almost three hours but then, because it was the Lord's will, turned back in ferocious wind.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=220\u2013224}}\n\nOn 30 May the mountain was being cleared apace with most of the party reaching Base Camp when Thompson rushed down, calling out in despair. He and Clough had been passing under the place of the \"Sword of Damocles\" when a [[serac]] fell creating an avalanche which had killed Clough.{{refn|group=note|The overhanging wall of ice they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" had collapsed on 23 May so they thought the location had become less dangerous. However, there were ice towers higher up and it was one of these that fell.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=111225\u2013226}}}} His body was carried down to base camp and he was buruied near there at the foot of a face where Clough had taught the Sherpas and television to use jumars and to abseil. Returning down the valley they found the earlier snow had melted and flowers were blooming.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=224\u2013229}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe expedition proved to be Britain's most important mountaineering achievement since the [[1953 Everest expedition|1953 British Mount Everest expedition]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Ed |title=Don Whillans: the vertical beatnik |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/06/features.sportmonthly1 |work=The Observer |date=6 March 2005 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912235700/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/06/features.sportmonthly1 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was a huge success because not only was the summit reached but it had been, for its time, the most difficult technical climb to the summit of a major world peak.{{sfnp|Unsworth|2000|p=434}} In mountaineering circles the expedition was recognised as a paradigm shift in [[Alpine style|alpine-style]] climbing.

On 27 May 1970 [[Don Whillans]] and [[Dougal Haston]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna I]] which at {{convert|26545|ft}} is the highest peak in the [[Annapurna Massif]] in [[Nepal]]. [[Chris Bonington]] led the expedition which approached up a glacier from the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] and then used rock climbing techniques to put [[fixed rope]]s up the steep South Face. Although the plan had been to use supplementary oxygen, in the event it was not possible to carry any cylinders high enough for the lead climbers to use on their summit bid.\n\nLow down on the mountain, on 30 May as the expedition was about to leave, [[Ian Clough]] was killed by a falling [[serac]]. Several members of the expedition rose to fame in Britain, and as a whole the expedition received international recognition in mountaineering circles on account of its innovative and extremely difficult nature.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Annapurna ===\n{{see also|Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal}}\nThe [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna massif]] is in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]a region of Nepal where for over one hundred years the ruling [[Rana dynasty]]  had not allowed explorers or mountaineers to enter the country.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=238\u2013241}}{{sfnp|Ward|Clark|1992}} In 1950 Nepal at last gave permission for the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]], to attempt [[Dhaulagiri]] or [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna I]], the two highest peaks in the Annapurna region. The expedition, led by [[Maurice Herzog]], mounted a successful summit attempt via the North Face. For most Himalayan mountains the easiest route to the summit is along a ridge route but for Annapurna the North Face is not too steep (though it is very exposed to avalanches) and the route subsequently turned out to be the easiest.{{sfnp|Herzog|1954|pp=48,54,57,102\u2013103}}{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=242\u2013253,387}} Although it was the first climbed of the eight-thousanders, Annapurna is not often climbed and there is a high death rate among those attempting it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Voiland |title=The Eight-Thousanders |url=https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/8000MeterPeaks |website=www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2013 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503184334/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Start of rock climbing in Himalaya ===\nAfter years of stagnation between the wars, British rock climbing underwent a renaissance, particularly with working-class climbing clubs starting up in the north of England and Scotland. The [[Rock and Ice Club]] in [[Manchester]], the Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club in [[Glasgow]] and several university climbing clubs were amongst those that engendered a highly competitive climbing environment. At [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] in Wales numerous routes of a very high standard were achieved using strictly [[free climbing]] techniques. [[Hamish MacInnes]] and [[Dougal Haston]], although not members, climbed with Creagh Dhu and MacInnes had mentored [[Chris Bonington]]'s youthful climbing as early as 1953.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nIn 1960, Bonington, as a member of a joint British\u2013Indian\u2013Nepalese army team led by [[J. O. M. Roberts|Jimmy Roberts]], reached the summit of the {{convert|26039|ft|adj=on}} [[Annapurna II]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of the range's main summit, Annapurna I. The route did not involve rock climbing.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=347,387}}\n\n[[Mount Everest]] was ascended in 1963 by an American team along [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1963|a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=387}}  Two years later, when planning with the American [[John Harlin]] for Harlin's ''direttissima'' attempt on the [[Eigerwand|North Face of the Eiger]], Harlin introduced Bonington to the American [[Big wall climbing|big wall]] technique of directly ascending a [[fixed rope]] using [[Jumar]]s.{{sfnp|Harlin|2008|pp=109\u2013111}} Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and [[Mick Burke (mountaineer)|Mick Burke]] who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=246}} The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=231}} From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8000-metre peaks]] climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nEncouraged by Roberts, Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing [[Annapurna]] by its South Face which he realised was going to require not just rock climbing but also [[Expedition style|siege climbing tactics]] because the ascent would take many weeks. No one had tried rock climbing at high altitude before. The face itself was almost twice as high as the {{convert|6000|ft}} [[Eigerwand]] and even above the rock band there was another {{convert|3000|ft}} to the summit.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971b|p=18\u201333}}{{sfnp|Bonington|2017|p=155}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}  The topography near the summit could be assessed from photographs Bonington had taken on the Annapurna II expedition of ten years earlier.{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=411}}\n\n===Planning and departure===\n{{external media|topic=Clip from TV programme|Annapurna|title=Annapurna South Face|headerimage=|caption=\n|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQE_65nk_p4 Annapurna: The Hardest Way Up]{{sfnp|Edwards|1971}}}}\nWith financial support for the expedition from the [[Mount Everest Foundation]], Bonington assembled a team from amongst his friends: [[Nick Estcourt]], [[Martin Boysen]], [[Ian Clough]], Mike Thompson, Burke and Haston. Advised to include an American to boost sales of the book he was planning, Bonington appointed [[Tom Frost]] who had considerable [[big wall]] experience in [[Yosemite]] as well as \u2013 secretly at the time \u2013 [[Nanda Devi]] on a [[Nanda Devi#CIA mission|CIA mission]] to install a nuclear-powered listening device for monitoring [[China and weapons of mass destruction|Chinese missiles]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}} Frost was known to and respected by Haston and [[Don Whillans]]. Whillans was to be deputy leader for, although by then he was an overweight heavy drinker and smoker who disliked Bonington, he had more Himalayan experience than any other British mountaineer still active.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=389\u2013390}} Indeed, only he, Bonington and Clough had been to Himalaya at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1986|p=16}} Also included as climbers were [[Kelvin Kent (mountaineer)|Kelvin Kent]], base camp manager, and David Lambert, the doctor. A four-man television team from [[ITN]] and [[Thames Television]] was to be accompanying them.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=414}}\n\n===Departure===\nThey took {{convert|18000|ft}} of rope for fixing (they did not use their climbing rope), 40 cylinders of Oxygen and six breathing sets.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=246,257}} The baggage was sent from London by sea with Whillans and Lambert flying to [[Bombay]]{{refn|group=note|[[Mumbai]] is the present name.}} to see to its unloading and transport to [[Pokhara]] by lorry. However, the ship was then delayed by about three weeks so Bonington arranged for Whillans and Lambert to travel to [[Kathmandu]] to reconnoitre the approach route instead of waiting at Bombay, and Clough would go to Bombay to deal with the baggage.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29\u201331,39}} They took oxygen cylinders intending to use supplementary oxygen above about {{convert|22500|ft}} but it was very little used for climbing and not at all above Camp VI. It was used, however, for people who had become ill.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=257\u2013259}}\n\n== March-in and Base Camp ==\n[[File:1970 Annapurna south face expedition approach route.svg|thumb|Approach route from [[Pokhara]] to Annapurna Base Camp]]\nIn March 1970 the expedition flew to Kathmandu and then on to [[Pokhara]] from where the trek to the southern vicinity of Annapurna was along an easy route. Unlike twenty years earlier when [[Maurice Herzog|Herzog]] had no satisfactory map and had to pioneer a route, by 1970 the track was well known even to [[hippie]] wanderers.{{refn|group=note|The eight-day trek route from Pokhara went up beside the [[Seti Gandaki River|Seti Khola]] river and then the Modi Khola (a tributary of the [[Gandaki river]]). Bonington notes passing through [[Naudanda]], [[Lumle]], Chondracot (now Chandrakot), Ghandrung (now [[Ghandruk]]), Chomro (now Chhomrong), Thomo and Hinko Cave.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=47\u201350,54,79}}}} Another change was that the Sherpas were no longer unsophisticated peasants \u2013 they were smart in appearance, spoke good English and had a Western attitude. [[Pasang Kami]], the sirdar, treated the sahibs as equals and this was reciprocated. The other Sherpas were Pemba Tharkay, Ang Pema, Mingma Tsering, Nima Tsering and Kancha. As it turned out, a group from the British Army Mountaineering Association, led by [[Henry Day (colonel)|Henry Day]], was setting off at the same time for an ascent on Herzog's north face route and they had greatly helped Bonington by flying out {{convert|1500|lb}} of baggage to supply him until his main baggage arrived.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=390\u2013391}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29,39,43,238}}{{sfnp|Day|1971|p=89}}\n\nOn 16 March Whillans, Thompson and two Sherpas went ahead of the main parties to reconnoitre the route and to find a suitable place for the base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=38\u201339}} A temporary location was found to be at the entrance to the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] at the location of a previous base camp: that of the 1957 expedition to [[Machapuchare]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=18,51}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=416}}\nThe slower-moving baggage train of 140 porters set off from Pokhara on 22 March and Clough with his 240 porters was able to leave Bombay with the delayed baggage on 24 March.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=42,53,81}}\n\nBonington and Whillans met up on 27 March and Whillans said he thought he and his Sherpas had seen a [[yeti]] and had photographed the footprints. More significantly, he had been able to identify a climbing route up the mountain's south face.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=56\u201362,68, ill 10}} After the whole party has gathered at the temporary base camp on 29 March an advance party including Whillans, Haston and Burke established a final base camp at {{convert|14000|ft}} three miles from the foot of the face.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=391}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=42}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=417}} Estcourt used a theodolite to make accurate altitude measurements of various points on the face because foreshortening makes estimation inaccurate. The porters returned to Pokhara from where many of them would help move up to Base Camp the main baggage being carried from Bombay by the party led by Clough, Thompson and Kent. Meanwhile, the lead climbers and Sherpas were left to ferry the advance baggage up to the final Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=62\u201366}} The monsoon was due at bbout the end of May.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=166,195}}\n\n== Climbing route ==\n[[File:1970 Annapurna south face expedition climbing route.png|thumb|Climbing route up South Face]]\nBetween Camp III at {{convert|20100|ft}} and the top of the Rock Band at {{convert|24750|ft}} the average slope is 55\u00b0.{{refn|group=note|Bonington compares this with 44\u00b0 on the [[Aiguille de la Brenva|Brenva face]] of [[Mont Blanc]] and 61\u00b0 on the Walker Spur of the [[Grandes Jorasses]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=237}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=236\u2013237}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Locations of camps on mountain\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Camp\n! colspan=\"2\" | Altitude\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupied{{refn|group=note|Dates of occupation{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=233}} unless noted otherwise.}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Description\n|-\n!  feet{{refn|group=note|Altitudes{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=237}} unless noted otherwise.}} !! metres{{refn|group=note|Altitudes in metres calculated from referenced figures in feet.}}\n|-\n| Temporary Base || 12,000{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|loc=plate 12}} || {{convert|12000|ft|disp=number}} || 28&nbsp;March<br />{{refn|group=note|Date of occupation by main party;  for advance party \u2013 21 March.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=51}}}} || sited at Base Camp of 1957 Machapuchare expedition{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=18,60}}\n|-\n| Base || 14,000 || {{convert|14000|ft|disp=number}} || 31 March{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=66}} || side of Annapurna glacier{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=60}}\n|-\n| Camp I || 16,000 || {{convert|16000|ft|disp=number}} || 2 April || on [[Nunatak|\"rognon\"]] (island of rock in glacier){{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=64}}\n|-\n| Camp II || 17,500 || {{convert|17500|ft|disp=number}} || 6 April || under rock overhang{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=76}}\n|-\n| Camp III || 20,100 || {{convert|20100|ft|disp=number}} || 13 April || large, flat area at Col{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=85}}\n|-\n| Camp IV || 21,300 || {{convert|21300|ft|disp=number}} || 23 April || sloping 30\u00b0  on Ice Ridge{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109,111}}\n|-\n| dump || 21,650{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,236}} || {{convert|21650|ft|disp=number}} || 11 May || col at top of Ice Ridge{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=139\u2013140,154,236}}\n|-\n| temporary<br /> Camp&nbsp;V || 22,500<br />{{refn|group=note|8,500 feet above Base Camp at 14,000 feet.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=147,237}}}} || {{convert|22500|ft|disp=number}} || 6 May{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=141}} || foot of Ice Wall, vulnerable to snow sliding from above{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=141}}\n|-\n| Camp V || 22,750 || {{convert|22750|ft|disp=number}} || 9 May || [[bergschrund]] at foot of Rock Band{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149,152}}\n|-\n| Camp VI || 24,000 || {{convert|24000|ft|disp=number}} || 19 May || tiny platform carved in snow at top of Flat Iron{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=194}}\n|-\n| Summit || 26,545 || {{convert|26545|ft|disp=number}} || 27 May ||\n|}\n\n==To Camp III and abortive start up Ice Ridge==\nWhillans and Haston had found a difficult route across the glacier and up to a [[Nunatak|rognon]] \u2013 an island of rock on a glacier \u2013 where Camp I was planned to be and then reached the flattish top of the rognon where Camp I would be just far enough away from the face \u2013 about a mile away \u2013 to avoid avalanche danger.

For a short distance the route was seriously threatened by an ice overhang which they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" but they decided to reduce the risk by moving under it as quickly as possible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=73\u201377}}\n\nWhen he arrived with the main baggage Clough was supposed to stop at Hinko Cave overnight on 7 April but, due to confusing instructions, with his entourage of 240 porters he continued on in a snowstorm to temporary base camp some miles further on. Some porters had refused to go beyond Hinko Cave and the rest, overloaded and without adequate clothes and shoes in the bad weather, variously got into states of anger and collapse. However, now the main gear had arrived, it was possible to sort out shelter under cover for the night and provide medical help when necessary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=79\u201381}} On this same day Whillans and Haston had reached the Ice Ridge at a col where Camp III was to be established. They had to climb through deep snow in bad weather. In ten days the expedition had got from the Sanctuary to half height on the face, although with the difficult climbing all to be done further ahead. They [[abseil]]ed down to Camp II from where, next day, they started placing fixed ropes towards the col.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nOn 11 March Boysen and Estcourt established Camp III on the col, where there were to be two Whillans Box tents at a spacious location, free from risk of avalanches or falling rocks.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=85,98}} The version used on Annapurna, designed by Whillans, was [[cuboid]] in shape, {{convert|6.5|x|4.0|x|4|ft}}, made of socketed aluminium tubes covered in nylon top and bottom and cotton-[[terylene]] at the sides. It was strengthened with nylon webbing straps and at one end was a nylon-zipped entrance. An inner nylon tent was available but not always used. It weighed {{convert|30|lb}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison the nylon tents of a hooped design, Bonington calls them RAFMA tents, weighed only {{convert|10|lb}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=251}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=66\u201367,249\u2013250}}\n\nOn 12 April, after Bonington had organised the logistics of getting Base Camp fully set up and equipped, he and Frost set from there so that on 14 April they could start to prospect a route up the Ice Ridge above Camp III. After investigating a snow shelf leading to a gully on the west of the ridge, Bonington decided avalanches posed too great a threat so he joined Frost who was ascending along the actual crest of the ridge. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than they had expected with snow too soft and loose for firm [[piton]] placements and there would be a need to set [[fixed rope]]s all the way up the ridge. Also, they had not formed a plan for placing fixed ropes \u2013 should the lead climber fix his rope or should he climb normally leaving the second climber to pay out a rope from his rucksack, fixing it as he climbed? To begin with the latter method seemed more successful but progress was dreadfully slow with Bonington never having previously encountered such appalling snow.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=86\u201391}} Later in the expedition the technique changed and they climbed using their {{convert|9|mm|adj=on}} fixed rope which they then secured with pitons and [[karabiner]]s, not using their {{convert|11|mm|adj=on}} climbing rope at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=247}}\n\nThat night at Camp III they discussed their religious beliefs \u2013 Bonington was a sceptic and Frost a [[Morman]]. Bonington wrote to his wife \"He is a convinced and fervent Mormon, never rams it down your throat, yet his faith has given him a code of conduct that puts him way out in front of most of us\". Next day it was straightforward to re-climb their fixed rope but again onward climbing was extremely difficult. On the previous day and this one Whillans and Haston had been ferrying supplies from Camp II up to Camp III and following their second climb they starting exploring the shelf which Bonington had investigated previously beside the ridge. Here they made such good progress that the pair on the ridge needed little persuasion to abandon  entirely their efforts on the lowest part of the ridge.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=91\u201395}}\n\nNext day all four climbers set off along the shelf with Haston breaking trail and never surrendering the lead. The avalanche risk was considerable even though they kept their distance from the ridge and matters got worse as they reached the gully threatened by avalanches from ice cliffs thousands of feet above and by [[Snow cornice|cornices]] on the ridge itself. They decided to avoid the gully by climbing a minor [[ar\u00eate]] which led from the foot of the gully up to a high point on the main ridge but they had to leave a [[deadman anchor]] when deteriorating weather forced them to retreat to camp. Next day Bonington and Frost got within {{convert|50|ft}} of the crest of the Ice Ridge but again bad weather forced a retreat.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=95\u201399}}\n\nBy 18 April only {{convert|1000|ft}} had been gained since the Col had been reached eleven days earlier and from Base Camp and on 19 April Haston again ascended the minor ar\u00eate where the way to the main ridge was blocked by huge cornices but he found he could slip through gaps in the rotten snow between the wall of the ridge and one of the cornices. However, after reaching the crest of main ridge and fixing a rope he was forced back by the weather. At last, two days later, he was able to reach the Ice Ridge and find an ideal place for Camp IV.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=102\u2013109}}\n\nThe expedition was unexpectedly enhanced when four trekkers \u2013 the Sherpas called them the \"London Sherpas\" \u2013 turned up at Base Camp completely unexpectedly.{{refn|group=note|The trekkers had left [[Essex]] in England in 1969 in a [[Land Rover]], planning to climb in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Delayed in Austria they had spent the winter in Afghanistan and then had driven to Kathmandu, flown to Pokhara, trekked over to the foothills of [[Dhaulagiri]] and crossed to Chomro via the Deroli Pass intending to reach the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=109}} The Deroli Pass, now more usually referred to as the [[Deurali Pass]], is on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] trail, near [[Ghorepani]] and [[Poon Hill]].}} In return for \"board and lodging\" the two men helped carry loads even as high as Camp IV and the women helped at Base Camp where Bonington thought their presence engendered a more a civilised and relaxed air. Other trekkers also turned up to get a grandstand view of the climb and to help carrying loads.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n==Camp IV to Camp V on the Rock Band==\nBoysen, Estcourt, Haston and Whillans worked together establishing Camp IV but the situation at Camp III became critical after several attempts to supply it from Camp II had failed because of deep snow and avalanches. Eventually an overnight carry was successful and in general it seemed the snow conditions improved the higher one got up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=110\u2013114}}\n\nBoysen and Estcourt tackled the upper part of the Ice Ridge above Camp IV which was very narrow with cornices to the left but solid rock on the right. At one point Boysen's progress was blocked except for a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tunnel which he could clamber through, without his rucksack, as if potholing. The tunnel led not further up the ridge but out onto an ice cliff with a {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} drop to the glacier. However, he managed to climb onto and up the cliff despite the drag of his climbing rope passing along a highly contorted route behind him. When he reached safety he had let out {{convert|150|ft}} of rope in ascending only {{convert|50|ft}}. It was the most difficult ice climb Boysen had ever done. There was no direct way for Estcourt to ascend to Boysen's stance so he had to repeat the circuitous climb. Boysen's next lead again went on to a traverse, which was later called the \"Terrible Traverse\", which he was not able to complete before descending to Camp IV for the night. They had spent all day climbing {{convert|300|ft}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=115\u2013119,125}} Next day it again proved impossible to keep to the crest of the ridge but a descent on the right to solid rock gave access to an ice-covered rock wall leading upwards. This climb had to be without the rope being secured with pitons because the rope would have jammed along its contorted route. They regained the ridge again only some {{convert|50|ft}} higher than they had reached the previous day. The following day they extended their route slightly further. After that they had to go down to recover from exhaustion but the fixed ropes they had left allowed everyone following to take a direct line though one that was neither safe nor easy.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=119\u2013121,125}}\n\nBonington and Clough took over the work of extending the route, reaching Camp IV on 27 April. Sometimes they advanced only {{convert|10|ft}} in an hour.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=123\u2013128}} At Whillans' suggestion, they arranged for Sherpas to carry all the climbers'supplies up to Camp III so that when climbers went down to rest they only needed to go to Camp III rather than Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=128}} After a few very difficult days, and without being able to regain the crest of the Ice Ridge at a higher point, Clough went down to be replaced by Haston. On 3 May Whillans, Frost and Burke carried a box tent up to Camp IV while Bonington and Haston with very difficult ice climbing reached a col at {{convert|21650|ft}} where the Ice Ridge terminates to be replaced by a snow slope leading up to the Ice Wall.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=124\u2013141}} Next day they carried a load of ropes to the col and Haston ran out {{convert|500|ft}} of rope towards the Ice Wall. At {{convert|22350|ft}} the slope suddenly changes from 45\u00b0 to vertical and this point was planned to become Camp V{{refn|group=note|The site turned out to be very poor so the camp here was only temporary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=149}}}} where a {{convert|18|lb|adj=on}} hooped tent was set up, capable of sleeping three. Supplying as high as here was a logistical problem because it took at least five days for anything to arrive from base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141,251}}\n\nSupported by Frost and Burke, Whillans and Haston established Camp V but that night spindrift  inundated the site and the tent so they decided to find a better camp location. Next day they explored the Ice Wall finding a \"gangway\" leading to the top of the Ice Wall and the foot of the Rock Band. At this point the overhang of the [[bergschrund]], although threatening, provided excellent shelter so they proposed moving Camp V to this point. On 9 May Frost and Burke established the camp at the new, higher location.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141\u2013153}} The climb from Camp IV to V was very long and difficult so two intermediate dumps{{refn|group=note|The lower of the dumps was at the top of the Ice Ridge and the other was at the original site for Camp V at the bottom of the Ice Wall.}} for supplies were used with carrying being done in shorter sections from above and below.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149\u2013150,154,178}}\n\n==Above Camp V==\n[[File:Tom Frost - South Face of Annapurna - 1970.jpg|thumb|Photograph by Frost: Boysen descending to Camp IV after carrying supplies up to Camp V.]]\nFrost and Burke started on the Rock Band which sloped at about 50\u00b0{{refn|group=note|Bonington likens this to the Second Ice Field on the [[Nordwand|North face of the Eiger]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=160}}}} Instead of taking the most direct line up a groove leading straight upwards, they cut over to the left aiming for the \"Flat Iron\", named after the similar-looking feature on the Eiger, with Burke doing the lead climbing. The good weather helped with the climbing but because of the thaw they were bombarded  from above by falling rocks. The climbers Further down the mountain were having to rest through illness or exhaustion so shortages of rope, oxygen, tents, food and fuel built up towards Camp V. On 12 May Burke and Frost made more progress but only through taking serious risks with inadequate piton placements but when they turned back for the day a storm hit them and their tent was almost buried. Fortunately by that time fresh supplies had arrived from lower camps.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154\u2013172}}\n\nBonington's general plan had been to pair off the leading climbers and to share the work of the pairs equitably by having periods of rest, carrying supplies to higher camps and extending the route. The Sherpas were carrying higher up the mountain than expected and other trekkers with climbing experience had turned up by chance and helped out. However at the higher camps things were not going so well and so on 13 May Bonington decided that when Frost and Burke came down to be rested they would be replaced by Whillans and Haston. In fact it was the turn of Estcourt and Boysen to force the route upwards but they had been working hard doing carrying while Whillans and Haston were rested. Over the radio between various camps some of the adversely affected climbers complained but were accepting it after Bonington agreed for Whillans and Haston to do a single carry before rotating into the lead. Whillans then started criticising Burke and Frost for making very slow progress on the Rock Band and so, to curtail the increasing bitterness, the radio call was ended leaving each pair to plan the detail of their newly assigned roles.{{refn|group=note|Bonington did not think Whillans' criticisms were at all fair. Indeed Burke and Frost has worked hard and made good progress.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=182}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=173\u2013180}}\n\nOn their last day in the lead Burke and Frost, possibly goaded by the criticism, managed to fix ropes up all the way to the Flat Iron. Burke had been on the face for 28 days, and Frost only slightly less \u2013 Bonington thought Burke's climb had been on the most exacting rock of the entire expedition. When Frost met Bonington down at Camp II he firmly told him he thought the stab in the back of Estcourt and Boysen had wrecked the morale of the expedition \u2013 all the same he maintained his close relationship with Bonington.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=180\u2013184}}\n\nOn 17 May Boysen, Whillans and Haston carried equipment to the top of the Flat Iron to a suitable site for Camp VI but on the way Boysen had to return to camp to recover. Whillans and Haston found a site for Camp VI but that night at Camp V the ridge tent was crushed with an avalanche of snow so Estcourt and Haston went down to the upper dump to collect the one intended for Camp VII and to get more food. Climbing back to Camp VI on 19 May, Haston's rucksack, containing his personal gear and food for Camp VI, fell down the mountain. So, that night, Whillans was alone at Camp VII with no food after the others had descended. Estcourt was alone at Camp V and so Bonington went up there to help him support the lead team. The climb from there to Camp VI was even more tiring and Bonington scarcely managed the {convert|200|ft|adj=on}} [[jumar]] climb near the top. However, he managed and even took the time on his way down to relocate the dangling rope and place further [[piton]]s on this [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] of the climb. As for oxygen, there were only three bottles at Camp V and another three at the upper dump. There was hardly any food or rope at Camp VI.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,185\u2013195}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=205\u2013209}}\n\nOn 20 May Haston returned to Camp VI where Whillans had been without food for over twenty-four hours. Bonington carried up there more food and a radio but had to dump the rope slightly below the camp. Camp VI was a terrible place \u2013 the tent was too large to fit on the ledge so Whillans and Haston had to sleep lying across the width of the tent. Also, the wind was severe and it was only held by two tent pegs, a rope over the top, and the weight of the climbers.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=209\u2013209}} The same day Estcourt carried the oxygen bottles up to Camp V from the upper dump and the lead climbers climbed {{convert|400|ft}} up from Camp VI but they were then out of food and rope and had no tent to pitch for Camp VII which they intended to place at the top of the Rock Band. They heard news that the army team on the other side of the mountain had reached the summit using a similar route to that of the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|French expedition in 1950]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\nOn 22 May Bonington and Estcourt headed up with supplies and oxygen cylinders towards Camp VI but Estcourt had to retreat back and Bonington, who was using supplementary oxygen, had to abandon the tent and oxygen ''en route''. Haston and Whillans had reached the top of the \"mini rock band\" at the top of the Rock Band but, with no rope left, they had needed to climb without protection, leaving only about {{convert|1500|ft}} to the summit, they estimated.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=200\u2013202}} They had reached the {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} snowfield above the Rock Band but without a tent or food. Next day Bonington carried tent, cin\u00e9 camera and food up from V to VI but he had needed to abandon his personal gear so he had to turn down an offer to join then on a summit attempt, Bonington and so had to go down again but the tent could be carried up next day to be left on the snow field above Camp VI. On 23 May with insufficient rope and no tent for Camp VII, the lead climbers took a rest day.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=212\u2013216,224}}\n\nIn terrible conditions on 24 May Bonington and Clough managed a carry to Camp VI but found Haston and Whillans had been forced back there so all four climbers had to spend the night together in the two-man tent. Bonington and Clough got back to Camp IV but once there the weather became impossible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\n==Summit==\nFor the next two days the entire mountain was snowbound and it seemed the monsoon had arrived but on 27 May 1970 at Camp VI there was an improvement in the weather. Leaving Camp VI about 07:00, without supplementary oxygen because they had none, Whillans and Haston reached the snow field at 11:00 from where they could see the summit through breaks in the cloud. They agreed to move the tent up to establish a camp at a higher location but they really had a more ambitious goal for the day. Indeed, any camp would be entirely lacking food or sleeping bags. They were faced with an ice plateau leading to a snow ridge and then an {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} cliff of mixed ice and rock rising up to the top of the mountain. They abandoned the tent at the foot of the ridge and climbed on without [[belay]]s. Neither climber had any difficulty with breathing.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\nThe last fifty feet of the ice cliff was vertical though there were good holds and as they reached the northern side of the mountain the wind dropped. They could see traces of army boot footprints but the flag that had been left a week earlier by the army expedition had blown away. Haston took a cin\u00e9 film of Whillans reaching the summit and then they swapped places. From the top, which they reached at 14:30 and stayed for about 10 minutes, they could see the other two Annapurna summits but nothing more. With no feeling of exhilaration, which they knew would come later. They had {{convert|150|ft}} of rope which, after they had abseiled down, was all there was left on the summit. By 17:00 they had managed the difficult descent to Camp VI.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Day|2010|p=188}}{{sfnp|Frost|1971|p=232}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=427}}\n\nLower down the mountain everyone had been completely stormbound but Bonington, having been confined to Camp IV, put in his routine 17:00 radio call asking Haston if they had been able to get out of their camp. Due to static on the radio he did not hear the reply \"Aye, we've just climbed Annapurna\" but this was heard load and clear at Base Camp and the news spread rapidly up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=204}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|p=219}}\n\n==Leaving the mountain==\nBurke and Frost wanted to make their own attempt on the summit and, contrary to his better judgement, Bonington agreed subject to the clearing of the camps proceeding at the same time. So on 28 May, Burke and Frost while Whillans and Haston descended, reaching Camp III at midday. Everyone was very excited but were held back by their British formality. Only by evening did Frost and Burke reach Camp VI. On 29 May they made their attempt but Burke had to turn back and Frost, having reached the snowfield, stayed there almost three hours but then, because it was the Lord's will, turned back in ferocious wind.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=220\u2013224}}\n\nOn 30 May the mountain was being cleared apace with most of the party reaching Base Camp when Thompson rushed down, calling out in despair. He and Clough had been passing under the place of the \"Sword of Damocles\" when a [[serac]] fell creating an avalanche which had killed Clough.{{refn|group=note|The overhanging wall of ice they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" had collapsed on 23 May so they thought the location had become less dangerous. However, there were ice towers higher up and it was one of these that fell.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=111225\u2013226}}}} His body was carried down to base camp and he was buruied near there at the foot of a face where Clough had taught the Sherpas and television to use jumars and to abseil. Returning down the valley they found the earlier snow had melted and flowers were blooming.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=224\u2013229}}\n\n==After the expedition==\nThe expedition proved to be Britain's most important mountaineering achievement since the [[1953 Everest expedition|1953 British Mount Everest expedition]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Ed |title=Don Whillans: the vertical beatnik |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/06/features.sportmonthly1 |work=The Observer |date=6 March 2005 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912235700/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/06/features.sportmonthly1 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was a huge success because not only was the summit reached but it had been, for its time, the most difficult technical climb to the summit of a major world peak.{{sfnp|Unsworth|2000|p=434}} In mountaineering circles the expedition was recognised as a paradigm shift in [[Alpine style|alpine-style]] climbing.

It is the largest and southernmost county of Ireland, situated in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]] and named after the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland's second-largest city. The [[Cork County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. Its largest market towns are [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]], [[Macroom]], [[Midleton]], and [[Skibbereen]]. In 2016, the county's population was 542,868, making it the third-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county in Ireland.<ref name=cso2016City/><ref name=cso2016County/> Notable Corkonians include [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Jack Lynch]], and [[Sonia O'Sullivan]].\n\nCork borders four other counties: [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. The county contains a section of the [[Golden Vale]] pastureland that stretches from [[Kanturk]] in the north to [[Allihies]] in the south. The south-west region, including [[West Cork]], is one of Ireland's main tourist destinations,<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.thejournal.ie/tourism-ireland-4-3506617-Jul2017/ | newspaper = TheJournal.ie | title = Ireland's most popular tourist counties and attractions have been revealed | date = 23 July 2017 | accessdate = 15 October 2017 | quote = \"'' the southwest, comprising Cork and Kerry, has the second-largest spend by tourists [after the Dublin region]''\" }}</ref> known for its rugged coast and [[List of megalithic monuments in Cork|megalithic monuments]] and as the starting point for the [[Wild Atlantic Way]].\n\nThe county is known as the \"Rebel county\", a name given to them by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII of England]] for its support of a man claiming to be Richard, Duke of York in a futile attempt at a rebellion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/if-not-for-collins-why-is-it-called-the-rebel-county-29469436.html|title=If not for collins, why is it called the rebel county?|website=Independent.ie}}</ref> The main third-level educator is [[University College Cork]], founded in 1845, and with a current undergraduate population around 15,000. Significant local industry and employers include technology company [[Dell EMC]], the European headquarters of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and Dairygold, which own milk-processing factories in [[Mitchelstown]] and [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]].\n\n==Political subdivisions==\nTwo [[Local government|local authorities]] have remits which collectively encompass the geographic area of the county and city of Cork. The county, excluding [[Cork city]], is administered by [[Cork County Council]], while the city is administered separately by [[Cork City Council]]. Both city and county are part of the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. For [[Eurostat|standardized European statistical purposes]], both Cork County Council and Cork City Council rank equally as first-level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. Thirty-four such [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities are in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nFor elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the county is divided into five constituencies\u2014[[Cork East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork East]], [[Cork North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-Central]], [[Cork North-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-West]], [[Cork South-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork South-Central]] and [[Cork South-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork South-West]]. Together they return 18 deputies ([[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]]) to the D\u00e1il.  The county is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]].\n\nFor purposes other than local government, such as the formation of sporting teams, the term \"County Cork\" is often taken to include both city and county.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Wedge tomb, [[Glantane East]]]]\nCounty Cork is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]], bordering [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. It is the [[List of Irish counties by area|largest county]] in Ireland by land area, and the largest of Munster's six counties by population and area. At the last census in 2016, Cork city stood at 125,657.<ref name=cso2016City/> The population of the entire county is 542,868<ref name=cso2016City/><ref name=cso2016County/> making it the state's second-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county and the third-most populous county on the island of Ireland. The remit of Cork County Council includes some suburbs of the city not within the area of Cork City Council.\n\n=== Baronies ===\n{{see also|List of baronies of Ireland}}\nTwenty-four historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] are in the county\u2014the most of any county in [[List of baronies of Ireland|Ireland]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed.\n\n===Civil parishes and townlands===\n{{main|List of civil parishes of County Cork}}\n{{see also|List of townlands of County Cork}}\n\nThe county has 253 civil parishes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |title=Placenames Database of Ireland.

The [[Shehy Mountains]] are on the border with Kerry and may be accessed from the area known as Priests Leap, near the village of Coomhola. The upland areas of the [[Ballyhoura Mountains|Ballyhoura]], [[Boggeragh Mountains|Boggeragh]], [[Derrynasaggart Mountains|Derrynasaggart]], and  [[Mullaghareirk Mountains|Mullaghareirk Mountain]] ranges add to the range of habitats found in the county. Important habitats in the uplands include blanket bog, heath, glacial lakes, and upland grasslands. Cork has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|13th-highest]] county peak in Ireland.\n\n===Rivers and lakes===\n[[File:Loch an Ghleanna Bhig (Glenbeg Lough) - geograph.org.uk - 263779.jpg|thumb|left|[[Glenbeg Lough]], [[Beara Peninsula]]]]\n[[File:Three Castle Head Upper Lake 2009 09 10.jpg|thumb|left|Upper lake at Three Castle Head, Mizen Head]]\nThree rivers, the [[River Bandon|Bandon]], [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]], and [[River Lee (Ireland)|Lee]], and their valleys dominate central Cork.{{original research inline|date=July 2017}} Habitats of the valleys and floodplains include woodlands, marshes, fens, and species-rich limestone grasslands. The River Bandon flows through several towns, including [[Dunmanway]] to the west of the town of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] before draining into Kinsale Harbour on the south coast. Cork's sea loughs include [[Lough Hyne]] and [[Lough Mahon]], and the county also has many small lakes. An area has formed where the River Lee breaks into a network of channels weaving through a series of wooded islands. About 85 hectares of swamp are around Cork's wooded area. The Environmental Protection Agency  carried out a survey of surface waters in County Cork between 1995 and 1997, which identified 125 rivers and 32 lakes covered by the regulations.\n\n===Coastline===\n{{See also|List of islands of Ireland}}\nCork has a mountainous and flat landscape with many beaches and sea cliffs along its coast. The southwest of Ireland is known for its peninsulas and some in Cork include the [[Beara Peninsula]], [[Sheep's Head]], [[Mizen Head]], and [[Brow Head]]. Brow Head is the most southerly point of mainland [[Ireland]]. There are many islands off the coast of the county, in particular, off [[West Cork]]. [[Carbery's Hundred Isles]] are the islands around Long Island Bay and Roaringwater Bay.\n\n[[File:Mizen head ireland.png|thumbnail|right|[[Mizen Head]] is the most south-westerly point of both Cork and Ireland.]]\n[[Fastnet Rock]] lies in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 11.3&nbsp;km south of mainland Ireland, making it the most southerly point of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Many notable islands lie off Cork, including [[Bere Island|Bere]], [[Great Island|Great]], [[Sherkin Island|Sherkin]], and [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]]. Cork has 1,094&nbsp;km of coastline, the second-longest coastline of any county after [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which has 1,168&nbsp;km.\n\n===Land and forestry===\nLike many parts of Munster, Cork has fertile agricultural land and many bog and peatlands. Cork has around 74,000 hectares of peatlands, which amount to 9.8% of the county's total land area. And the county contains around {{convert|79188|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of forest and woodland area, or 10.5% of Cork's land area, higher than the national average of 9%.\n\n===Wildlife===\nThe [[hooded crow]], ''Corvus cornix'' is a common bird, particularly in areas nearer the coast. Due to this bird's ability to (rarely) prey upon small lambs, the gun clubs of Cork County have killed many of these birds in modern times.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009.

This name has 15th Century origins, but from the 20th century the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u20131921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-treaty stronghold during the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the [[Kingdom of Desmond|Kingdom of ''Deas Mumhan'']] (South [[Munster]]), anglicised as [[Kingdom of Desmond|\"Desmond\"]], ruled by the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthy M\u00f3r dynasty]]. After the [[Norman Ireland|Norman Invasion]] in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and [[County Kerry]]. [[Dunlough Castle]], standing just north of [[Mizen Head]], is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (A.D. 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], who became the [[Earl of Desmond|Earls of Desmond]]. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of 1569\u20131573 and 1579\u201383. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]]. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantation of Munster]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Perkin Warbeck.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Perkin Warbeck]]\nIn 1491 Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow [[Henry VII of England]]. The Cork people fought with Perkin because he was French and not English, they were the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel city' originates in these events.\n\nIn 1601 the decisive [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. [[Kinsale]] had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older [[Kingdom of Desmond|County Desmond]] in 1606.\n\n[[File:Michael Collins.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], photographed in 1919]]\nIn the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Fenians]] and for the constitutional [[Irish nationalism|nationalism]] of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], from 1910 that of the [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u20131921). Three Cork Brigades of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] in November 1920 and the [[Crossbarry Ambush]] in March 1921. The activity of IRA [[flying column]]s, such as the one under [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in west Cork, was popularised in the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes The Barley]]''. On 11 December 1920 [[The Burning of Cork|Cork City centre was gutted by fires]] started by the [[Black and Tans]] in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed, many other towns and villages around the county suffered a similar fate including [[Fermoy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebelcork.com/ |title=Rebelcork.com |publisher=Rebelcork.com |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402070746/http://www.rebelcork.com/ |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called [[Munster Republic]]. However, Cork was taken by troops of the [[Irish Free State]] in August 1922 in the [[Irish Free State offensive]], that included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near [[Clonakilty]] and assassinated during the civil war in [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], both in west Cork.\n\n==Irish language==\nCounty Cork has two [[Gaeltacht]] areas where the [[Irish language]] is the primary medium of everyday speech.

It is the largest and southernmost county of Ireland, situated in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]] and named after the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland's second-largest city. The [[Cork County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. Its largest market towns are [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]], [[Macroom]], [[Midleton]], and [[Skibbereen]]. In 2016, the county's population was 542,868, making it the third-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county in Ireland.<ref name=cso2016City/><ref name=cso2016County/> Notable Corkonians include [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Jack Lynch]], and [[Sonia O'Sullivan]].\n\nCork borders four other counties; [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. The county contains a section of the [[Golden Vale]] pastureland which stretches from [[Kanturk]] in the north to [[Allihies]] in the south.

Significant local industry and employers include technology company [[Dell EMC]], the European headquarters of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and Dairygold, which own milk-processing factories in [[Mitchelstown]] and [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]].\n\n==Political subdivisions==\nTwo [[Local government|local authorities]] have remits which collectively encompass the geographic area of the county and city of Cork. The county, excluding [[Cork city]], is administered by [[Cork County Council]], while the city is administered separately by [[Cork City Council]]. Both city and county are part of the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. For [[Eurostat|standardized European statistical purposes]], both Cork County Council and Cork City Council rank equally as first-level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. Thirty-four such [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities are in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nFor elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the county is divided into five constituencies\u2014[[Cork East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork East]], [[Cork North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-Central]], [[Cork North-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-West]], [[Cork South-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork South-Central]] and [[Cork South-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork South-West]]. Together they return 18 deputies ([[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]]) to the D\u00e1il.  The county is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]].\n\nFor purposes other than local government, such as the formation of sporting teams, the term \"County Cork\" is often taken to include both city and county.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Wedge tomb, [[Glantane East]]]]\nCounty Cork is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]], bordering [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. It is the [[List of Irish counties by area|largest county]] in Ireland by land area, and the largest of Munster's six counties by population and area. At the last census in 2016, Cork city stood at 125,657.<ref name=cso2016City/> The population of the entire county is 542,868<ref name=cso2016City/><ref name=cso2016County/> making it the state's second-[[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county and the third-most populous county on the island of Ireland.

While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed.\n\n===Civil parishes and townlands===\n{{main|List of civil parishes of County Cork}}\n{{see also|List of townlands of County Cork}}\n\nThe county has 253 civil parishes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |title=Placenames Database of Ireland.

The [[Shehy Mountains]] are on the border with Kerry and may be accessed from the area known as Priests Leap, near the village of Coomhola. The upland areas of the [[Ballyhoura Mountains|Ballyhoura]], [[Boggeragh Mountains|Boggeragh]], [[Derrynasaggart Mountains|Derrynasaggart]], and  [[Mullaghareirk Mountains|Mullaghareirk Mountain]] ranges add to the range of habitats found in the county.

The River Bandon flows through several towns, including [[Dunmanway]] to the west of the town of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] before draining into Kinsale Harbour on the south coast. Cork's sea loughs include [[Lough Hyne]] and [[Lough Mahon]], and the county also has many small lakes. An area has formed where the River Lee breaks into a network of channels weaving through a series of wooded islands. About 85 hectares of swamp are around Cork's wooded area. The Environmental Protection Agency  carried out a survey of surface waters in County Cork between 1995 and 1997, which identified 125 rivers and 32 lakes covered by the regulations.\n\n===Coastline===\n{{See also|List of islands of Ireland}}\nCork has a mountainous and flat landscape with many beaches and sea cliffs along its coast. The southwest of Ireland is known for its peninsulas and some in Cork include the [[Beara Peninsula]], [[Sheep's Head]], [[Mizen Head]], and [[Brow Head]]. Brow Head is the most southerly point of mainland [[Ireland]]. There are many islands off the coast of the county, in particular, off [[West Cork]]. [[Carbery's Hundred Isles]] are the islands around Long Island Bay and Roaringwater Bay.\n\n[[File:Mizen head ireland.png|thumbnail|right|[[Mizen Head]] is the most south-westerly point of both Cork and Ireland.]]\n[[Fastnet Rock]] lies in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 11.3&nbsp;km south of mainland Ireland, making it the most southerly point of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Cork has around 74,000 hectares of peatlands, which amount to 9.8% of the county's total land area. And the county contains around {{convert|79188|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of forest and woodland area, or 10.5% of Cork's land area, higher than the national average of 9%.\n\n===Wildlife===\nThe [[hooded crow]], ''Corvus cornix'' is a common bird, particularly in areas nearer the coast.

This name has 15th Century origins, but from the 20th century the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u20131921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-treaty stronghold during the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the [[Kingdom of Desmond|Kingdom of ''Deas Mumhan'']] (South [[Munster]]), anglicised as [[Kingdom of Desmond|\"Desmond\"]], ruled by the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthy M\u00f3r dynasty]]. After the [[Norman Ireland|Norman Invasion]] in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and [[County Kerry]]. [[Dunlough Castle]], standing just north of [[Mizen Head]], is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (A.D. 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], who became the [[Earl of Desmond|Earls of Desmond]]. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of 1569\u20131573 and 1579\u201383. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]]. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantation of Munster]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Perkin Warbeck.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Perkin Warbeck]]\nIn 1491 Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow [[Henry VII of England]]. The Cork people fought with Perkin because he was French and not English, they were the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel city' originates in these events.\n\nIn 1601 the decisive [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. [[Kinsale]] had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older [[Kingdom of Desmond|County Desmond]] in 1606.\n\n[[File:Michael Collins.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], photographed in 1919]]\nIn the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Fenians]] and for the constitutional [[Irish nationalism|nationalism]] of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], from 1910 that of the [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u20131921). Three Cork Brigades of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] in November 1920 and the [[Crossbarry Ambush]] in March 1921. The activity of IRA [[flying column]]s, such as the one under [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in west Cork, was popularised in the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes The Barley]]''. On 11 December 1920 [[The Burning of Cork|Cork City centre was gutted by fires]] started by the [[Black and Tans]] in reprisal for IRA attacks.

From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called [[Munster Republic]]. However, Cork was taken by troops of the [[Irish Free State]] in August 1922 in the [[Irish Free State offensive]], that included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923.

An offspring is heterotic if its [[trait (biology)|traits]] are enhanced as a result of mixing the genetic contributions of its parents. These effects can be due to [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] or [[non-Mendelian inheritance]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn proposing the term ''heterosis'' to replace the older term '''heterozygosis''', [[George Harrison Shull|G.H. Shull]] aimed to avoid limiting the term to the effects that can be explained by heterozygosity in Mendelian inheritance.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1948|title=What Is \"Heterosis\"?|author=George Harrison Shull|journal=Genetics|volume=33|issue=5|pages=439\u2013446|pmc=1209417|pmid=17247290}}</ref>\n{{quote|The physiological vigor of an organism as manifested in its rapidity of growth, its height and general robustness, is positively correlated with the degree of dissimilarity in the gametes by whose union the organism was formed \u2026 The more numerous the differences between the uniting gametes \u2014 at least within certain limits \u2014 the greater on the whole is the amount of stimulation \u2026 These differences need not be Mendelian in their inheritance \u2026 To avoid the implication that all the genotypic differences which stimulate cell-division, growth and other physiological activities of an organism are Mendelian in their inheritance and also to gain brevity of expression I suggest \u2026 that the word 'heterosis' be adopted.}}\n\nHeterosis is often discussed as the opposite of [[inbreeding depression]] although differences in these two concepts can be seen in evolutionary considerations such as the role of [[genetic variation]] or the effects of [[genetic drift]] in small populations on these concepts. Inbreeding depression occurs when related parents have children with [[trait (biology)|traits]] that negatively influence their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] largely due to [[homozygosity]].  In such instances, [[outcrossing]] should result in heterosis.\n\nNot all outcrosses result in heterosis.  For example, when a hybrid inherits traits from its parents that are not fully compatible, fitness can be reduced.

[[Inbreeding depression]] is the loss of fitness due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be [[homozygous]] for [[recessive]] [[alleles]] that are mildly harmful (or produce a trait that is undesirable from the standpoint of the breeder). Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.\n\nSelective breeding of plants and animals, including hybridization, began long before there was an understanding of underlying scientific principles. In the early 20th century, after [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's laws]] came to be understood and accepted, geneticists undertook to explain the superior vigor of many plant hybrids. Two competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, were developed:<ref>{{cite journal| author=Crow, James F. |year=1948 |journal=Genetics |title=Alternative Hypotheses of Hybrid Vigor |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=477\u2013487 |author-link=James F.

The dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority of hybrids to the suppression of undesirable recessive alleles from one parent by dominant alleles from the other. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to loss of genetic diversity, with the strains becoming purely homozygous at many loci. The dominance hypothesis was first expressed in 1908 by the geneticist [[Charles Davenport]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Davenport CB|year=1908 |journal=Science |title=Degeneration, albinism and inbreeding |volume=28| pages=454\u20135| doi=10.1126/science.28.718.454-b| pmid=17771943| issue=718 |bibcode=1908Sci....28..454D |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448006 }}</ref> Under the dominance hypothesis, deleterious alleles are expected to be maintained in a random-mating population at a selection\u2013mutation balance that would depend on the rate of mutation, the effect of the alleles and the degree to which alleles are expressed in heterozygotes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=David E.|last2=Dudash|first2=Michele R.|date=2003-06-29|title=Recent approaches into the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in plants|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=358|issue=1434|pages=1071\u20131084|doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1295|issn=0962-8436|pmc=1693197|pmid=12831473}}</ref>\n* '''Overdominance hypothesis'''. Certain combinations of alleles that can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains are [[heterozygote advantage|advantageous in the heterozygote]]. The overdominance hypothesis attributes the heterozygote advantage to the survival of many alleles that are recessive and harmful in homozygotes. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to a high percentage of these harmful recessives. The overdominance hypothesis was developed independently by [[Edward Murray East|Edward M. East]] (1908)<ref>{{cite journal| author=East EM|year=1908 |journal=Reports of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiments Station for 1907 |title=Inbreeding in corn |pages=419\u2013428 }}</ref> and [[George Harrison Shull|George Shull]] (1908).<ref>{{cite journal| author=Shull GH|year=1908 |journal=Reports of the American Breeders Association |title=The composition of a field of maize |pages=296\u2013301 }}</ref> Genetic variation at an overdominant locus is expected to be maintained by balancing selection. The high fitness of heterozygous genotypes favours the persistence of an allelic polymorphism in the population.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDominance and overdominance have different consequences for the [[gene expression|gene expression profile]] of the individuals. If overdominance is the main cause for the fitness advantages of heterosis, then there should be an over-expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of the two parents.\n\n==Historical retrospective==\nPopulation geneticist [[James F. Crow|James Crow]] (1916\u20132012) believed, in his younger days, that overdominance was a major contributor to hybrid vigor. In 1998 he published a retrospective review of the developing science.<ref name=Crow>{{cite journal| author= Crow, James F. |year= 1998 |journal= Genetics |title= 90 Years Ago: The Beginning of Hybrid Maize |volume= 148 |pages= 923\u2013928| pmid= 9539413| issue= 3| pmc= 1460037 |author-link= James F. Crow }}</ref> According to Crow, the demonstration of several cases of [[heterozygote advantage]] in Drosophila and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the overdominance theory among scientists studying plant hybridization.  But overdominance implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs, that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids. Only a few conclusive cases of overdominance have been reported in all of genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance theory has made a comeback.\n\nCrow wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and [of] the high yield of hybrids. There is little statistical evidence for contributions from overdominance and [[epistasis]]. But whether the best hybrids are getting an extra boost from overdominance or favorable epistatic contributions remains an open question.<ref name=Crow/></blockquote>\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe term heterosis often causes confusion and even controversy, particularly in selective breeding of [[domestic animal]]s, because it is sometimes (incorrectly) claimed that all [[crossbred]] plants and animals are \"genetically superior\" to their parents, due to heterosis{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. However, there are two problems with this claim:\n\n* First, according to an article published in the journal ''[[Genome Biology]]'', \"[[genetic superiority]]\" is an ill-defined term and not generally accepted terminology within the scientific field of genetics.<ref name=Risch>{{cite journal |vauthors=Risch N, Burchard E, Ziv E, Tang H |title=Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease |journal=Genome Biol. |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=comment2007 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12184798 |pmc=139378 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007}}</ref> A related term [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is well defined, but it can rarely be directly measured. Instead, scientists use objective, measurable quantities, such as the number of seeds a plant produces, the germination rate of a seed, or the percentage of organisms that survive to reproductive age.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weller SG, Sakai AK, Thai DA, Tom J, Rankin AE |title=Inbreeding depression and heterosis in populations of Schiedea viscosa, a highly selfing species |journal=J.

Use of the term \"superiority\" is commonplace for example in crop breeding, where it is well understood to mean a better-yielding, more robust plant for agriculture. Such a plant may yield better on a farm, but would likely struggle to survive in the wild, making this use open to misinterpretation. In human genetics any question of \"genetic superiority\" is even more problematic due to the historical and political implications of any such claim. Some may even go as far as to describe it as a questionable value judgement in the realm of politics, not science.<ref name=Risch/>\n* Second, not all hybrids exhibit heterosis (see [[outbreeding depression]]).\n\nAn example of the ambiguous value judgements imposed on hybrids and hybrid vigor is the [[mule]]. While mules are almost always infertile, they are valued for a combination of hardiness and temperament that is different from either of their horse or donkey parents. While these qualities may make them \"superior\" for particular uses by humans, the infertility issue implies that these animals would most likely become extinct without the intervention of humans through [[animal husbandry]], making them \"inferior\" in terms of [[natural selection]].\n\n== Genetic and epigenetic bases ==\n{{Main|Heterozygote advantage|Histone H3|microRNA}}\n\nSince the early 1900s, two competing genetic hypotheses, not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been developed to explain hybrid vigor. More recently, an epigenetic component of hybrid vigor has also been established.<ref name=Ni>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ni Z, Kim ED, Ha M, etal |title=Altered circadian rhythms regulate growth vigour in hybrids and allopolyploids |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7227 |pages=327\u201331 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19029881 |pmc=2679702 |doi=10.1038/nature07523 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..327N }}</ref><ref name=Baranwal>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baranwal VK, Mikkilineni V, Zehr UB, Tyagi AK, Kapoor S |title=Heterosis: emerging ideas about hybrid vigour |journal=J.

It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles. The genetic '''overdominance hypothesis''' states that some combinations of alleles (which can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains) are especially [[heterozygote advantage|advantageous when paired in a heterozygous individual]]. This hypothesis is commonly invoked to explain the persistence of some alleles (most famously the [[Sickle cell trait]] allele) that are harmful in homozygotes. In normal circumstances, such harmful alleles would be removed from a population through the process of natural selection.  Like the dominance hypothesis, it attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to expression of such harmful recessive alleles. In any case, outcross matings provide the benefit of masking deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.  This benefit has been proposed to be a major factor in the maintenance of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, as summarized in the article [[Evolution of sexual reproduction]].\n\nAn epigenetic contribution to heterosis has been established in plants,<ref name=Baranwal /> and it has also been reported in animals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Han Z, Mtango NR, Patel BG, Sapienza C, Latham KE |title=Hybrid vigor and transgenerational epigenetic effects on early mouse embryo phenotype |journal=Biol.

The mechanism involves acetylation and/or methylation of specific amino acids in [[histone H3]], a protein closely associated with DNA, which can either activate or repress associated genes.\n\n=== Major histocompatibility complex in animals ===\nOne example of where particular genes may be important in vertebrate animals for heterosis is the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC). Vertebrates inherit several copies of both [[MHC class I]] and [[MHC class II]] from each parent, which are used in [[antigen presentation]] as part of the adaptive immune system. Each different copy of the genes is able to bind and present a different set of potential peptides to [[T-lymphocytes]]. These genes are highly polymorphic throughout populations, but will be more similar in smaller, more closely related populations. Breeding between more genetically distant individuals will decrease the chance of inheriting two alleles which are the same or similar, allowing a more diverse range of peptides to be presented. This therefore gives a decreased chance that any particular pathogen will not be recognised, and means that more antigenic proteins on any pathogen are likely to be recognised, giving a greater range of T-cell activation and therefore a greater response. This will also mean that the immunity acquired to the pathogen will be against a greater range of antigens, meaning that the pathogen must [[Antigenic drift|mutate]] more before immunity is lost. Thus hybrids will be less likely to be succumb to pathogenic disease and will be more capable of fighting off infection.\n\n== Plants ==\nCrosses between inbreds from different '''heterotic groups''' result in vigorous F1 hybrids with significantly more heterosis than F1 hybrids from inbreds within the same heterotic group or pattern. Heterotic groups are created by plant breeders to classify inbred lines, and can be progressively improved by reciprocal recurrent selection.\n\nHeterosis is used to increase yields, uniformity, and vigor.  Hybrid breeding methods are used in [[maize]], [[sorghum]],  [[rice]], [[sugar beet]], [[onion]], [[spinach]], [[sunflowers]], [[broccoli]] and to create a more [[cannabis (drug)|psychoactive]] [[cannabis]].\n\n=== Corn (maize) ===\nNearly all field corn ([[maize]]) grown in most [[Developed country|developed nations]] exhibits heterosis. Modern corn hybrids substantially outyield conventional cultivars and respond better to [[fertilizer]].\n\nCorn heterosis was famously demonstrated in the early 20th century by [[George Harrison Shull|George H. Shull]] and [[Edward Murray East|Edward M. East]] after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. [[William James Beal]] of [[Michigan State University]] based on work begun in 1879 at the urging of [[Charles Darwin]]. Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a [[field experiment]] demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by [[Eugene Davenport]] and [[Perry Greeley Holden|Perry Holden]], 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. [[Donald F. Jones]] at the [[Connecticut]] [[Agricultural experiment station|Agricultural Experiment Station]], [[New Haven]] invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914\u20131917. Jones' method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single-cross hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The process of creating these hybrids often involves [[detasseling]].\n\nTemperate maize hybrids are derived from two main heterotic groups: Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic, and non stiff stalk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Rice (''Oryza sativa'') ===\nRice production has seen enormous rise in China due to heavy uses of hybrid rice. In China, efforts have generated a super hybrid rice strain (LYP9) with a production capability of ~15 tons per hectare. In India also, several varieties have shown high vigor, including RH-10 and Suruchi 5401.\n\n== Hybrid livestock ==\nThe concept of heterosis is also applied in the production of commercial [[livestock]]. In cattle, crosses between [[Black Angus]] and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] produce a cross known as a \"[[Black Baldy]]\". In [[swine]], \"blue butts\" are produced by the cross of [[Hampshire (pig)|Hampshire]] and Yorkshire. Other, more exotic hybrids such as \"[[beefalo]]\" are also used for specialty markets.\n\n=== Poultry ===\nWithin [[poultry]], [[sex-linked]] genes have been used to create hybrids in which males and females can be sorted at one day old by color. Specific genes used for this are genes for barring and wing feather growth. Crosses of this sort create what are sold as Black Sex-links, Red Sex-links, and various other crosses that are known by trade names.\n\nCommercial [[broiler]]s are produced by crossing different strains of White Rocks and White Cornish, the Cornish providing a large frame and the Rocks providing the fast rate of gain. The hybrid vigor produced allows the production of uniform birds with a marketable carcass at 6\u20139 weeks of age.\n\nLikewise, hybrids between different strains of White Leghorn are used to produce laying flocks that provide the majority of white [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] for sale in the United States.\n\n== Dogs ==\nIn 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = O\u2019Neill | first1 = D.

An offspring is heterotic if its [[trait (biology)|traits]] are enhanced as a result of mixing the genetic contributions of its parents. These effects can be due to [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] or [[non-Mendelian inheritance]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn proposing the term ''heterosis'' to replace the older term '''heterozygosis''', [[George Harrison Shull|G.H. Shull]] aimed to avoid limiting the term to the effects that can be explained by heterozygosity in Mendelian inheritance.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1948|title=What Is \"Heterosis\"?|author=George Harrison Shull|journal=Genetics|volume=33|issue=5|pages=439\u2013446|pmc=1209417|pmid=17247290}}</ref>\n{{quote|The physiological vigor of an organism as manifested in its rapidity of growth, its height and general robustness, is positively correlated with the degree of dissimilarity in the gametes by whose union the organism was formed \u2026 The more numerous the differences between the uniting gametes \u2014 at least within certain limits \u2014 the greater on the whole is the amount of stimulation \u2026 These differences need not be Mendelian in their inheritance \u2026 To avoid the implication that all the genotypic differences which stimulate cell-division, growth and other physiological activities of an organism are Mendelian in their inheritance and also to gain brevity of expression I suggest \u2026 that the word 'heterosis' be adopted.}}\n\nHeterosis is often discussed as the opposite of [[inbreeding depression]] although differences in these two concepts can be seen in evolutionary considerations such as the role of [[genetic variation]] or the effects of [[genetic drift]] in small populations on these concepts. Inbreeding depression occurs when related parents have children with [[trait (biology)|traits]] that negatively influence their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] largely due to [[homozygosity]].  In such instances, [[outcrossing]] should result in heterosis.\n\nNot all outcrosses result in heterosis.  For example, when a hybrid inherits traits from its parents that are not fully compatible, fitness can be reduced.  This is a form of [[outbreeding depression]].\n\n==Dominance versus overdominance==\n'''Dominance versus overdominance''' is a [[scientific controversy]] in the field of [[genetics]] that has persisted for more than a century.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Birchler J.A. |author2=Auger D.L. |author3=Riddle N.C. | year = 2003 | title = In search of the molecular basis of heterosis | url = | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 15 | issue = 10| pages = 2236\u20132239 | doi=10.1105/tpc.151030 | pmid=14523245 | pmc=540269}}</ref> These two alternative hypotheses were first stated in 1908.\n\n==Genetic basis==\n\nWhen a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity. [[Inbreeding depression]] is the loss of fitness due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be [[homozygous]] for [[recessive]] [[alleles]] that are mildly harmful (or produce a trait that is undesirable from the standpoint of the breeder). Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.\n\nSelective breeding of plants and animals, including hybridization, began long before there was an understanding of underlying scientific principles. In the early 20th century, after [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's laws]] came to be understood and accepted, geneticists undertook to explain the superior vigor of many plant hybrids. Two competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, were developed:<ref>{{cite journal| author=Crow, James F. |year=1948 |journal=Genetics |title=Alternative Hypotheses of Hybrid Vigor |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=477\u2013487 |author-link=James F.

The dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority of hybrids to the suppression of undesirable recessive alleles from one parent by dominant alleles from the other. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to loss of genetic diversity, with the strains becoming purely homozygous at many loci. The dominance hypothesis was first expressed in 1908 by the geneticist [[Charles Davenport]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Davenport CB|year=1908 |journal=Science |title=Degeneration, albinism and inbreeding |volume=28| pages=454\u20135| doi=10.1126/science.28.718.454-b| pmid=17771943| issue=718 |bibcode=1908Sci....28..454D |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448006 }}</ref> Under the dominance hypothesis, deleterious alleles are expected to be maintained in a random-mating population at a selection\u2013mutation balance that would depend on the rate of mutation, the effect of the alleles and the degree to which alleles are expressed in heterozygotes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=David E.|last2=Dudash|first2=Michele R.|date=2003-06-29|title=Recent approaches into the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in plants|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=358|issue=1434|pages=1071\u20131084|doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1295|issn=0962-8436|pmc=1693197|pmid=12831473}}</ref>\n* '''Overdominance hypothesis'''. Certain combinations of alleles that can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains are [[heterozygote advantage|advantageous in the heterozygote]]. The overdominance hypothesis attributes the heterozygote advantage to the survival of many alleles that are recessive and harmful in homozygotes. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to a high percentage of these harmful recessives. The overdominance hypothesis was developed independently by [[Edward Murray East|Edward M. East]] (1908)<ref>{{cite journal| author=East EM|year=1908 |journal=Reports of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiments Station for 1907 |title=Inbreeding in corn |pages=419\u2013428 }}</ref> and [[George Harrison Shull|George Shull]] (1908).<ref>{{cite journal| author=Shull GH|year=1908 |journal=Reports of the American Breeders Association |title=The composition of a field of maize |pages=296\u2013301 }}</ref> Genetic variation at an overdominant locus is expected to be maintained by balancing selection. The high fitness of heterozygous genotypes favours the persistence of an allelic polymorphism in the population.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDominance and overdominance have different consequences for the [[gene expression|gene expression profile]] of the individuals. If overdominance is the main cause for the fitness advantages of heterosis, then there should be an over-expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of the two parents.\n\n==Historical retrospective==\nPopulation geneticist [[James F. Crow|James Crow]] (1916\u20132012) believed, in his younger days, that overdominance was a major contributor to hybrid vigor. In 1998 he published a retrospective review of the developing science.<ref name=Crow>{{cite journal| author= Crow, James F. |year= 1998 |journal= Genetics |title= 90 Years Ago: The Beginning of Hybrid Maize |volume= 148 |pages= 923\u2013928| pmid= 9539413| issue= 3| pmc= 1460037 |author-link= James F. Crow }}</ref> According to Crow, the demonstration of several cases of [[heterozygote advantage]] in Drosophila and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the overdominance theory among scientists studying plant hybridization.  But overdominance implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs, that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids. Only a few conclusive cases of overdominance have been reported in all of genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance theory has made a comeback.\n\nCrow wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and [of] the high yield of hybrids. There is little statistical evidence for contributions from overdominance and [[epistasis]]. But whether the best hybrids are getting an extra boost from overdominance or favorable epistatic contributions remains an open question.<ref name=Crow/></blockquote>\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe term heterosis often causes confusion and even controversy, particularly in selective breeding of [[domestic animal]]s, because it is sometimes (incorrectly) claimed that all [[crossbred]] plants and animals are \"genetically superior\" to their parents, due to heterosis{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. However, there are two problems with this claim:\n\n* First, according to an article published in the journal ''[[Genome Biology]]'', \"[[genetic superiority]]\" is an ill-defined term and not generally accepted terminology within the scientific field of genetics.<ref name=Risch>{{cite journal |vauthors=Risch N, Burchard E, Ziv E, Tang H |title=Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease |journal=Genome Biol. |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=comment2007 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12184798 |pmc=139378 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007}}</ref> A related term [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is well defined, but it can rarely be directly measured. Instead, scientists use objective, measurable quantities, such as the number of seeds a plant produces, the germination rate of a seed, or the percentage of organisms that survive to reproductive age.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weller SG, Sakai AK, Thai DA, Tom J, Rankin AE |title=Inbreeding depression and heterosis in populations of Schiedea viscosa, a highly selfing species |journal=J. Evol. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1434\u201344 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16313456 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00965.x }}</ref> From this perspective, [[crossbred]] plants and animals exhibiting heterosis may have \"superior\" traits, but this does not necessarily equate to any evidence of outright \"genetic superiority\". Use of the term \"superiority\" is commonplace for example in crop breeding, where it is well understood to mean a better-yielding, more robust plant for agriculture. Such a plant may yield better on a farm, but would likely struggle to survive in the wild, making this use open to misinterpretation. In human genetics any question of \"genetic superiority\" is even more problematic due to the historical and political implications of any such claim. Some may even go as far as to describe it as a questionable value judgement in the realm of politics, not science.<ref name=Risch/>\n* Second, not all hybrids exhibit heterosis (see [[outbreeding depression]]).\n\nAn example of the ambiguous value judgements imposed on hybrids and hybrid vigor is the [[mule]]. While mules are almost always infertile, they are valued for a combination of hardiness and temperament that is different from either of their horse or donkey parents. While these qualities may make them \"superior\" for particular uses by humans, the infertility issue implies that these animals would most likely become extinct without the intervention of humans through [[animal husbandry]], making them \"inferior\" in terms of [[natural selection]].\n\n== Genetic and epigenetic bases ==\n{{Main article|Heterozygote advantage|Histone H3|microRNA}}\n\nSince the early 1900s, two competing genetic hypotheses, not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been developed to explain hybrid vigor. More recently, an epigenetic component of hybrid vigor has also been established.<ref name=Ni>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ni Z, Kim ED, Ha M, etal |title=Altered circadian rhythms regulate growth vigour in hybrids and allopolyploids |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7227 |pages=327\u201331 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19029881 |pmc=2679702 |doi=10.1038/nature07523 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..327N }}</ref><ref name=Baranwal>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baranwal VK, Mikkilineni V, Zehr UB, Tyagi AK, Kapoor S |title=Heterosis: emerging ideas about hybrid vigour |journal=J.

It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles. The genetic '''overdominance hypothesis''' states that some combinations of alleles (which can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains) are especially [[heterozygote advantage|advantageous when paired in a heterozygous individual]]. This hypothesis is commonly invoked to explain the persistence of some alleles (most famously the [[Sickle cell trait]] allele) that are harmful in homozygotes. In normal circumstances, such harmful alleles would be removed from a population through the process of natural selection.  Like the dominance hypothesis, it attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to expression of such harmful recessive alleles. In any case, outcross matings provide the benefit of masking deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.  This benefit has been proposed to be a major factor in the maintenance of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, as summarized in the article [[Evolution of sexual reproduction]].\n\nAn epigenetic contribution to heterosis has been established in plants,<ref name=Baranwal /> and it has also been reported in animals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Han Z, Mtango NR, Patel BG, Sapienza C, Latham KE |title=Hybrid vigor and transgenerational epigenetic effects on early mouse embryo phenotype |journal=Biol.

The mechanism involves acetylation and/or methylation of specific amino acids in [[histone H3]], a protein closely associated with DNA, which can either activate or repress associated genes.\n\n=== Major histocompatibility complex in animals ===\nOne example of where particular genes may be important in vertebrate animals for heterosis is the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC). Vertebrates inherit several copies of both [[MHC class I]] and [[MHC class II]] from each parent, which are used in [[antigen presentation]] as part of the adaptive immune system. Each different copy of the genes is able to bind and present a different set of potential peptides to [[T-lymphocytes]]. These genes are highly polymorphic throughout populations, but will be more similar in smaller, more closely related populations. Breeding between more genetically distant individuals will decrease the chance of inheriting two alleles which are the same or similar, allowing a more diverse range of peptides to be presented. This therefore gives a decreased chance that any particular pathogen will not be recognised, and means that more antigenic proteins on any pathogen are likely to be recognised, giving a greater range of T-cell activation and therefore a greater response. This will also mean that the immunity acquired to the pathogen will be against a greater range of antigens, meaning that the pathogen must [[Antigenic drift|mutate]] more before immunity is lost. Thus hybrids will be less likely to be succumb to pathogenic disease and will be more capable of fighting off infection.\n\n== Plants ==\nCrosses between inbreds from different '''heterotic groups''' result in vigorous F1 hybrids with significantly more heterosis than F1 hybrids from inbreds within the same heterotic group or pattern. Heterotic groups are created by plant breeders to classify inbred lines, and can be progressively improved by reciprocal recurrent selection.\n\nHeterosis is used to increase yields, uniformity, and vigor.  Hybrid breeding methods are used in [[maize]], [[sorghum]],  [[rice]], [[sugar beet]], [[onion]], [[spinach]], [[sunflowers]], [[broccoli]] and to create a more [[cannabis (drug)|psychoactive]] [[cannabis]].\n\n=== Corn (maize) ===\nNearly all field corn ([[maize]]) grown in most [[Developed country|developed nations]] exhibits heterosis. Modern corn hybrids substantially outyield conventional cultivars and respond better to [[fertilizer]].\n\nCorn heterosis was famously demonstrated in the early 20th century by [[George Harrison Shull|George H. Shull]] and [[Edward Murray East|Edward M. East]] after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. [[William James Beal]] of [[Michigan State University]] based on work begun in 1879 at the urging of [[Charles Darwin]]. Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a [[field experiment]] demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by [[Eugene Davenport]] and [[Perry Greeley Holden|Perry Holden]], 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. [[Donald F. Jones]] at the [[Connecticut]] [[Agricultural experiment station|Agricultural Experiment Station]], [[New Haven]] invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914\u20131917. Jones' method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single-cross hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The process of creating these hybrids often involves [[detasseling]].\n\nTemperate maize hybrids are derived from two main heterotic groups: Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic, and non stiff stalk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Rice (''Oryza sativa'') ===\nRice production has seen enormous rise in China due to heavy uses of hybrid rice. In China, efforts have generated a super hybrid rice strain (LYP9) with a production capability of ~15 tons per hectare. In India also, several varieties have shown high vigor, including RH-10 and Suruchi 5401.\n\n== Hybrid livestock ==\nThe concept of heterosis is also applied in the production of commercial [[livestock]]. In cattle, crosses between [[Black Angus]] and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] produce a cross known as a \"[[Black Baldy]]\". In [[swine]], \"blue butts\" are produced by the cross of [[Hampshire (pig)|Hampshire]] and Yorkshire. Other, more exotic hybrids such as \"[[beefalo]]\" are also used for specialty markets.\n\n=== Poultry ===\nWithin [[poultry]], [[sex-linked]] genes have been used to create hybrids in which males and females can be sorted at one day old by color. Specific genes used for this are genes for barring and wing feather growth. Crosses of this sort create what are sold as Black Sex-links, Red Sex-links, and various other crosses that are known by trade names.\n\nCommercial [[broiler]]s are produced by crossing different strains of White Rocks and White Cornish, the Cornish providing a large frame and the Rocks providing the fast rate of gain. The hybrid vigor produced allows the production of uniform birds with a marketable carcass at 6\u20139 weeks of age.\n\nLikewise, hybrids between different strains of White Leghorn are used to produce laying flocks that provide the majority of white [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] for sale in the United States.\n\n== Dogs ==\nIn 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = O\u2019Neill | first1 = D.

It lies on the northern fringe of [[Greater Glasgow]], approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} from the [[Glasgow city centre|city centre]]. [[Shires of Scotland|Historically]] in [[Lanarkshire]], the area was once part of the historic [[Civil parish|parish]] of [[Cadder]] - originally lands granted by [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] to the [[Bishop of Glasgow]], [[Jocelin (Bishop of Glasgow)|Jocelin]], in 1180. It was later part of the county of [[Lanarkshire]], and then an independent [[burgh]] from 1964 to 1975. Today, Bishopbriggs' close geographic proximity to [[Glasgow]] now effectively makes it a suburb and [[commuter town]] of the city. The town's Gaelic name ''Coille Dobhair'' reflects the name of the old parish of Cadder.

Even more than a century later, after substantial growth, the village was still being referred to in the terms of the larger settlement of [[Cadder]]. Despite fears that the village would end up being swamped by the rapid expansion of nearby Glasgow it managed to avoid this, however {{convert|2,000|acre|ha|lk=on}} of the wider parish of Cadder were eventually absorbed by Glasgow Corporation in 1926, which would be used to construct the [[Milton, Glasgow|Milton]] peripheral housing scheme from the late 1940s.\n\nBy 1793, the introduction of new farming techniques had improved yields. While crops such as oats, barley, potatoes and flax flourished, Cadder's population fared less well; a decrease of around 600 from the mid-1760s was attributed to new agricultural methods which combined smaller farms or [[Run rig]]s and swept away independent tenants, known as the [[Lowland Clearances]]. By 1836 there were 'almost no [[Cotter (farmer)|cotters]]' with the largest farms employing no more than ten people, and some of those only as maid servants. Land reclamation (through drainage) changed the landscape so that crops could grow, where once there was only marshland. Dairy farming was relied upon to cover ground rents.\n\n===19th-century development===\nWith the completion of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] in 1790, the area began to attract ironstone and coal mining industry. The [[Carron Company]], became the areas's main employer, building the mining villages of Mavis Valley and Jellyhill to accommodate its workers. From there, the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] formed a convenient and direct transport link with their famous ironworks near [[Falkirk]]. There were also freestone quarries established at Coltpark ([[Colston]]), Crowhill, Huntershill and Kenmure.\n\nDevelopment during the 19th century was slow compared to the industrially-driven expansion of other nearby areas, such as [[Springburn]]. In 1836 Bishopbriggs' population stood at 175, compared to neighbouring [[Auchinairn]] Village's 284. [[Bishopbriggs railway station]] on the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]], opened in 1842 however, underlining its status as the emerging focus of the local area, although expansion remained slow throughout the latter half of the 19th century. The population of Bishopbriggs was recorded as 658 in 1861 and 782 in 1871.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/20672 |title=Gazetteer entries for Cadder |accessdate=2018-08-23 |author=Vision of Britain}}</ref> At the time, the village had also been known as 'Bishopbridges' and was so described in published maps up to the mid-1850s. The arrival of the railway heralded a change, although the first printed tickets called the station Bishopbridges, platform signage showed Bishopbriggs and it has remained so ever since.\n\n[[Cadder Yard]] (2&nbsp;km north of the Cross) became a major facility for the routing of freight and minerals on the line. Short spurs were constructed to link the various quarries (initially with the Forth & Clyde Canal) for transportation of minerals, very little evidence of this is visible today, but it is still possible to discover wooden sleepers in odd places. An underpass for the line which crosses under the A803 Kirkintilloch Road (at Hilton Road) was converted to a pedestrian subway and is one of the town's hidden gems. Also at Cadder Yard was a short spur that connected with Bishopbriggs Oil Terminal, used as a distribution point for West of Scotland deliveries before it ultimately closed in 1982.\n\n[[File:BriggsMap1923.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bishopbriggs and adjacent villages, circa 1923]]\nThe area continued to be a major centre for freestone quarrying during the 19th Century, supplying many major municipal building projects in Glasgow, such as [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]]'s new [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]] main building (the second largest [[Gothic Revival]] building in Britain). The blonde coloured Bishopbriggs Sandstone is from the Upper [[Limestone]] Formation of the Lower [[Carboniferous]] age. It was one of the most important Glasgow building stones, and was a major supplier of stone for Victorian Glasgow along with stone from quarries in other local areas such as [[Giffnock]]. Increasing demand for building stone and the emergence of the railways allowed for the additional transportation of red sandstone to Glasgow from quarries in [[Locharbriggs]] from the late 19th century onwards.\n\nThe blonde sandstone however was still considered to be of such value that in the 1850s when the depth of overburden became too great for opencast quarrying, it was mined using the traditional pillar and stall technique. Quarrying ceased in 1907 however after a fall at Huntershill killed several men.\n\n===20th-century development===\nThe [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow tramway]] network was extended north from Springburn to Bishopbriggs in 1903, with a terminus at Kirkintilloch Road close to traffic lights at what is now the Triangle Shopping Centre. As all trams were required to switch tracks (and direction) at a central crossover this proved dangerous as the levels of traffic on the main road increased. The tracks were eventually relocated and a new crossover created in a short spur which required all trams to turn left and terminate at Kenmure Avenue, where they changed direction and returned southwards to Glasgow. The tram service ceased across Glasgow in 1962.\n\nBishopbriggs suffered an economic decline in the early decades of the 20th century. With the working out of the quarries at that time, what mines the area had closed systematically thereafter, throughout the 1920s.\n\n[[File:SisterLaurasBW.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Sister Lauras Food Supplement]]]][[File:Wire Rope Co catalogue inside cover.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The Scottish Wire Rope Company was one of several firms that located in Bishopbriggs during the early 20th century.]] Manufacturing in the town began to grow after the [[First World War]], one of the manufacturers that located in Bishopbriggs at the time was a producer of [[Infant formula]], [[Sister Lauras Food Supplement]]. There were also engineering firms and the Scottish Wire Rope Company factory at Crowhill, [[Cadbury UK|Trebor Bassett]] at Huntershill, and Blackie and Sons Publishers at Cadder amongst those providing alternative employment.\n\nIn 1929, a new {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} printing works for [[Blackie and Son Limited|Blackie and Sons Publishers]] were erected on Kirkintilloch Road, retaining the name of their original [[Townhead]] works, 'The Villafield Press'. During the [[Second World War]], Blackie & Son Ltd used part of their Bishopbriggs works for the manufacture of [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|3.45\" shells]] for the [[Ministry of Supply]]. They also undertook some toolmaking for another Glasgow company, [[William Beardmore and Company]]; and, for a short time, produced aircraft radiators. By 1960 the publishing and administration section of the company also relocated from Townhead to join the printing section in Kirkintilloch Road, Bishopbriggs, and in 1971, new premises were occupied in Wester Cleddens Road, eventually becoming the headquarters of the company. The printworks were now no longer required and earmarked for demolition, following a demand for residential property in the area. The Villafield name was retained in the housing estate now on the site, opposite Cooper's Fine Fare supermarket (now Asda).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120731153201/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/blackie.html History of Blackie and Sons.]</ref>\n\nThe Robert McCarroll [[Plant Hire]] company was established at Crowhill in 1934 and continues to operate today.<ref>[http://www.robertmccarroll.com/history.html Robert McCarroll Limited - Company History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526003755/http://www.robertmccarroll.com/history.html |date=May 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the town saw the opening of its first (and only) cinema, The Kenmure. Located on Kirkintilloch Road it had an impressive towering facade and a single auditorium with capacity for 1000 patrons. Eventually the clientele dwindled after the arrival of television (in 1953) and by 1958 a decision was made to close it down. It lay derelict for a number of years, before being demolished to make way for the Churchill Way shopping centre which was constructed in 1962 (and demolished in 1993). The entrance to the cinema was where the Bishopbriggs Sub-Post Office is now located.\n\nProposals were also drawn up for the creation of a {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}} \"[[Garden city movement|Garden suburb]]\" at [[Cadder]] by [[Patrick Abercrombie]], under the instruction of [[Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, 10th Baronet|Sir John Stirling-Maxwell]] in 1936 but by the 1950s just 26 art deco [[bungalow]]s had been completed.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the town was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] at around midnight on 7 April 1941, as part of a series of raids on the [[Greater Glasgow]] area during early 1941, which included the notorious [[Clydebank Blitz]] some three weeks earlier. Approximately five bombs were dropped in the vicinity of South Crosshill Road. One fell behind Cadder Church Hall, an annex building of Bishopbriggs School (now the library) housing the junior school, that had been converted into an [[Air Raid Precautions]] first-aid post, received a direct hit, killing five staff instantly, along with four civilian residents of South Crosshill Road. Three ARP staff were also injured in the blast and died of their injuries at Lennox Castle Hospital in [[Lennoxtown]] the next day. The only strategic targets in the area were the railway and RAF Bishopbriggs (now Low Moss Prison), a barrage balloon depot established at Cadder in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkintilloch-herald.co.uk/news/Memories-still-haunt-nearly-70.5811152.jp |title=Memories still haunt nearly 70 years on |publisher=Kirkintilloch Herald |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, an unprecedented boost to the town's population came about as a result of the large-scale building programmes of the fifties and sixties which eventually replaced Balmuildy, Cadder and Woodhill farmlands with private housing, effectively amalgamating the various villages in the area into a single town, centred on the village of Bishopbriggs, increasing the population from 5,272 in 1951 to 21,000 in the early 1970s. The significant increase in local population was at least partially influenced by the recommendations of the [[Bruce Report]], which advocated the reduction of the population density of inner-city Glasgow and dispersal of its population to the outskirts and suburbs of the city.\n\nAgriculture continued to diminish in importance throughout the 20th century as demand for residential development grew; in 1920 there were 31 working farms in the area, in 1948 that number had fallen to 24 and by 1989 there were only 13 left.\n\n==Modern Bishopbriggs==\n===Bishopbriggs Cross===\n[[File:Bishopbriggs Cross - geograph.org.uk - 409245.jpg|thumb|left|View of Bishopbriggs Cross looking north along [[Kirkintilloch]] Road from the junction with Crowhill Road.]]\nThe [[Town centre]] is known as 'The Village', 'Bishopbriggs Cross' or simply 'The Cross'. The principal retail areas are the Triangle Shopping Centre and the Cross Court. The Triangle Shopping Centre was created via the demolition of older tenement housing stock and the Kenmure Church Hall on the eastern side of Kirkintilloch Road to facilitate the construction of new development called 'The Triangle' so called due to the shape of the available land. The first floor fronting Kirkintilloch Road contained commercial offices, with its first anchor tenant  [[Local government in Scotland|as a district council office]], twelve retail units, and a [[Morrisons]] (formerly [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]]) supermarket in 1991. In the Cross itself, tenement buildings dating from the Victorian era are still present on the western side of Bishopbriggs Cross.\n\nThere are proposals by Muse Developments for a \u00a332 million redevelopment of the Triangle Shopping Centre, incorporating the former site of Bishopbriggs High School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkintilloch-herald.co.uk/news/32m-plan-for-Bishopbriggs.5285163.jp |title=\u00a332m plan for Bishopbriggs |publisher=Kirkintilloch Herald |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2018-06-02}}</ref> The plans include: the creation of new public space, retail units, surface car parking, the relocation of St. Matthew's Church and hall and the construction of a new, larger, Morrisons supermarket.

Meadowburn Primary School hosts a Gaelic Medium Unit. There are also two Secondary schools, both of which have been rebuilt as the result of a [[Public-Private Partnership]] investment into education infrastructure, first launched in 2006 by [[East Dunbartonshire]] Council.\n\nBishopbriggs has two secondary schools; [[Bishopbriggs Academy]] ([[Non-denominational]]) at Woodhill and [[Turnbull High School]] ([[Catholic School|Roman Catholic]]) at Kenmure. Both schools rank as some of the best in Scotland, with Bishopbriggs being named Scottish State School of the year in both 2014 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sue Leonard |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-uk-schools-guide-scottish-state-secondary-school-of-the-year-0xwhth3gr |title=Scottish State Secondary School of the Year: Bishopbriggs Academy, Glasgow &#124; Parent Power |publisher=The Sunday Times |date= |accessdate=2018-06-02}}</ref> Both schools have had new-build campuses built, which were completed in August 2009.\n\nBishopbriggs Academy was established in 2006 via the amalgamation of Bishopbriggs High School and Thomas Muir High School and was initially housed in the old Bishopbriggs High School building. The new building for Bishopbriggs Academy was scheduled to be built at the site of the old Bishopbriggs High School campus near Bishopbriggs Cross. However, after representations from the contractors, it was relocated to the former Thomas Muir High School site at Woodhill. The decision to change the location of the new school went against public opinion and caused significant local controversy at the time. The relocation has, however, made a large area of land adjacent to the Cross available for redevelopment.\n\nIn addition to these schools, there is also St Mary's on the edge of Bishopbriggs, which is a secure residential school for [[Young offender]]s on remand, under sentence and Children's Panel Orders. It is a modern, purpose built secure unit for 24 young people aged between 11 and 16<ref>{{cite web|author=CELCIS |url=http://www.stmaryskenmure.org.uk/information/aims-and-values/ |title=Aims and Values |publisher=St Marys Kenmure |date= |accessdate=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare===\nThere has been controversy over the decision by [[NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde|NHS Greater Glasgow]] to downgrade facilities at the local [[Stobhill Hospital]] in nearby Springburn to an [[Ambulatory care]] facility, which will result in the nearest [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency]] and [[inpatient]] facilities being located at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in the city centre, as well as the development of an inpatient [[Psychiatric hospital]] at the site.

Following local government reorganisation, dissolution of the burgh system, and the creation of Regional and District Authorities, as a result of the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], Bishopbriggs became part of the [[Strathclyde]] Region in 1975. The local Ratepayers Association again played a major role in keeping Bishopbriggs outwith Glasgow district and within the [[Strathkelvin]] district of the Strathclyde Region, along with [[Kirkintilloch]] and [[Lenzie]].\n\nWith the introduction of the present [[Local government in Scotland|unitary local government system]] in 1996, and the dissolution of the Regional and District setup, as a result of the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], Bishopbriggs became part of the [[East Dunbartonshire]] Council area. As a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], the town is now represented on the council by two [[Ward (country subdivision)|Wards]], represented by three [[Councillor]]s each: Billy Hendry ([[Scottish Conservative Party|CON]]), Anne McNair ([[Scottish National Party|SNP]]) and Una Walker ([[Scottish Labour Party|LAB]]) in Bishopbriggs North & Torrance, with Alan Moir (LAB), Gordan Low (SNP) and Michael O'Donnell (LAB) in Bishopbriggs South.<ref>[http://www.eastdunbarton.gov.uk/Web+Site/Live/EDWebLive.nsf/LU-AllContent/KRAE-5F2C6E?OpenDocument East Dunbartonshire - List of Councillors with Map of Wards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218025604/http://www.eastdunbarton.gov.uk/Web%2BSite/Live/EDWebLive.nsf/LU-AllContent/KRAE-5F2C6E?OpenDocument |date=December 18, 2007  }}</ref> Cllr Billy Hendry is deputy leader of East Dunbartonshire Council.\n\nIn the national government, Bishopbriggs is represented by the [[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency of the Scottish Parliament]] with the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] being [[Rona Mackay]] of the [[Scottish National Party (SNP)]], as well as the 7 [[Additional Member System|additional]] list MSPs that make up the [[West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|West of Scotland region]]. The town is represented at Westminster by the [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dunbartonshire constituency of the House of Commons]], with the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|MP]] being [[Amy Callaghan]] also of the SNP. Both constituencies are considered to be [[Marginal seat]]s, with relatively high numbers of [[Swing vote]]s.

Although entirely [[Scots language|Scots]] in origin, some prefer the explanation that it was named after 'the Bishop's Bridge', supposedly that over the Callie [[Burn (stream)|Burn]] that runs through Bishopbriggs Park. Early 19c engraved maps show the settlement as 'Bishopbridges'. However others believed the middle 'b' was a corruption. This, so the argument goes, appeared because it rolls off the tongue more easily than the claimed original name of 'Bishop's Riggs'. In this alternative ''[[Run rig|riggs]]'' refers to the lands which the [[Bishop of Glasgow]] raised [[teinds]] from.\n\n==Transport==\n===Air===\n[[Glasgow International Airport]], at [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], is the nearest commercial airport serving the [[Greater Glasgow]] region, however a private landing strip at [[Cumbernauld Airport]] services smaller aircraft and helicopters.\n\n===Road===\nBishopbriggs is connected to the UK motorway network at Junction 2 of the [[M80 motorway]] at [[Robroyston]]. This interchange connects with the Bishopbriggs Relief Road that runs from Robroyston, [[Bypass (road)|bypassing]] Bishopbriggs to the east of Woodhill and Westerhill before linking up with the Torrance Roundabout near Low Moss. The main road through Bishopbriggs itself is Kirkintilloch Road, part of the [[A803 road|A803]] which connects Glasgow to Falkirk and Grangemouth.\n\n===Rail===\nThe town is served by [[Bishopbriggs railway station]], and is the first stop for local trains departing from [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street station]] on the [[Croy Line]] to Stirling. All rail services are provided by [[Abellio ScotRail]].  Journey time to Glasgow is 9 minutes.\n\n===Canal===\nThe Bishopbriggs section of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] opened in 1775 and when completed, connected the [[River Clyde]], at [[Bowling, West Dunbartonshire|Bowling]], to the [[River Forth]], at [[Grangemouth]]. Junctions at [[Falkirk]] with the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] and at [[Maryhill]] to the [[Monkland Canal]] completed the network. The canal reopened in 2003 to non-commercial navigation as part of the Millennium Project. This included the newly reconstructed Farm Bridge over the Canal at Mavis Valley, adjacent to the Leisuredrome. The previous fixed [[Girder bridge]] replaced an older [[Bascule bridge]], and was built after the closure of the canal in 1962. It had been set at a very low level, inhibiting canal navigation. Farm Bridge was also known as \"Brash's Bridge\", because members of the Brash family held the post of bridge-keeper for over a century, from 1838 to 1942. Brash's bridge-house was on the north bank of the canal, beside the bridge. The only other Bridge across the canal in Bishopbriggs is at Cadder.\n\n===Bus===\nBus services provide services through the Kelvin Valley (Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth), long-distance services to Stirling and Falkirk were discontinued on 2017. Bus companies include [[First Glasgow]] in addition to a local circular service 142 from [[Glasgow Citybus]] (previously operated by John Morrow Coaches) that runs a local route around the town linking the Cross, Mavis Valley, Cadder, Strathkelvin Retail Park, Woodhill and Auchinairn from 0800 to 1700 Mon-Fri. Additional services 147 (to Scotstoun) and 148 (to Clydebank) are infrequent and used only to facilitate trips to the bus depot. Defunct operator [[Kelvin Scottish]] Buses had their headquarters in the town at Westerhill Road.\n\n==Twin towns==\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Corbeil-Essonnes]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Japan}} [[Yoichi, Hokkaido|Yoichi]], [[Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.glasgowguide.co.uk/images_bishopbriggs_01.html Images of Bishopbriggs]\n* [http://www.eastdunbarton.gov.uk/ East Dunbartonshire Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091123024343/http://www.huntershillvillage.com/ Huntershill Village]\n* [http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/sumdep.aspx?T=BBG Live train departure information]\n\n{{East Dunbartonshire Settlements}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Burghs]]\n[[Category:Bishopbriggs| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in East Dunbartonshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the singer named after this town|Bishop Briggs}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n |country = Scotland\n |official_name= Bishopbriggs\n |gaelic_name=Coille Dobhair\n |scots_name= Beeshops' Rigs<ref>[http://www.scots-online.org/dictionary/read.asp?letter=B&CurPage=19 The Online Scots Dictionary]</ref>\n |static_image_name= 84bishopbriggs.jpg\n |static_image_width= 120\n |static_image_caption= Bishopbriggs' Burgh Coat of Arms as issued by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]]\n |os_grid_reference= NS615705\n |coordinates = {{coord|55.9046|-4.2250|display=inline,title}}\n |population= 23,500\n| pushpin_map             = Scotland East Dunbartonshire#Scotland Glasgow\n |unitary_scotland= \n |lieutenancy_scotland= [[Lanarkshire]]\n |post_town= GLASGOW <ref>{{cite web|author=Evox Facilities |url=http://www.evoxfacilities.co.uk/evoxptn.html |title=List of UK post towns |publisher=Evox Facilities |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219123813/http://www.evoxfacilities.co.uk/evoxptn.html |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n |postcode_district = G64\n |postcode_area= G\n |dial_code= 0141\n |constituency_westminster= [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dunbartonshire]]\n |constituency_scottish_parliament= [[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden]]\n |london_distance=\n |edinburgh_distance=\n }}\n'''Bishopbriggs''' is a town in [[East Dunbartonshire]], Scotland. It lies on the northern fringe of [[Greater Glasgow]], approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} from the [[Glasgow city centre|city centre]]. [[Shires of Scotland|Historically]] in [[Lanarkshire]], the area was once part of the historic [[Civil parish|parish]] of [[Cadder]] - originally lands granted by [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] to the [[Bishop of Glasgow]], [[Jocelin (Bishop of Glasgow)|Jocelin]], in 1180. It was later part of the county of [[Lanarkshire]], and then an independent [[burgh]] from 1964 to 1975. Today, Bishopbriggs' close geographic proximity to [[Glasgow]] now effectively makes it a suburb and [[commuter town]] of the city. The town's Gaelic name ''Coille Dobhair'' reflects the name of the old parish of Cadder.  It was ranked the 2nd most desirable postcode in Scotland to live in following a study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research in 2015 and 2016.<ref>http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/565708/Scotland-s-most-desirable-postcodes-revealed</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/best-worst-areas-live-uk-9938782 |title=Do you live in one of the nicest areas in Britain?

It has a population of approximately 23,500 people.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Antonine.Wall.Roman.forts.jpg|thumb|upright=2|right|alt=map of Antonine wall with forts|Forts and ''Fortlets'' associated with the [[Antonine Wall]] from west to east: [[Bishopton, Renfrewshire|Bishopton]], [[Old Kilpatrick]], [[Duntocher]], ''[[Cleddans]]'', [[Castlehill Fort|Castlehill]], [[Bearsden]], ''[[Summerston]]'', [[Balmuildy]], ''[[Wilderness Plantation]]'', [[Cadder]], ''[[Glasgow Bridge, Kirkintilloch|Glasgow Bridge]]'', [[Kirkintilloch]], [[Auchendavy]], [[Bar Hill Fort|Bar Hill]], [[Croy Hill]], [[Westerwood]], [[Castlecary]], ''[[Seabegs Wood|Seabegs]]'', [[Rough Castle]], [[Camelon]], ''[[Watling Lodge]]'', [[Falkirk]], [[Mumrills]], [[Inveravon]], ''[[Kinneil House|Kinneil]]'', [[Carriden House|Carriden]]]]\nBishopbriggs' history stretches at least to [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, as [[Cadder]] was a Roman fort on the [[Antonine Wall]], the furthest and most northerly boundary of the Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macdonald|first1=Sir George|title=The Roman wall in Scotland, by Sir George Macdonald|date=1934|publisher=The Clarendon press|location=Oxford|pages=297\u2013312|edition=2d ed., rev., enl., and in great part rewritten|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3760345;view=2up;seq=430;size=125|accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref> \nAs early as 1568, reference is made to a path northwards from Glasgow as the 'common passage to Bischopis Briggis'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring070.htm |title=Springburn Virtual Museum: Cowlairs Mansion, c 1860s |publisher=Gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2018-06-02}}</ref> Bishopbriggs was first documented in the [[Cadder]] Parish records of 1655, and was recorded to have had only eleven residents in the mid-18th century. Even more than a century later, after substantial growth, the village was still being referred to in the terms of the larger settlement of [[Cadder]]. Despite fears that the village would end up being swamped by the rapid expansion of nearby Glasgow it managed to avoid this, however {{convert|2,000|acre|ha|lk=on}} of the wider parish of Cadder were eventually absorbed by Glasgow Corporation in 1926, which would be used to construct the [[Milton, Glasgow|Milton]] peripheral housing scheme from the late 1940s.\n\nBy 1793, the introduction of new farming techniques had improved yields. While crops such as oats, barley, potatoes and flax flourished, Cadder's population fared less well; a decrease of around 600 from the mid-1760s was attributed to new agricultural methods which combined smaller farms or [[Run rig]]s and swept away independent tenants, known as the [[Lowland Clearances]]. By 1836 there were 'almost no [[Cotter (farmer)|cotters]]' with the largest farms employing no more than ten people, and some of those only as maid servants. Land reclamation (through drainage) changed the landscape so that crops could grow, where once there was only marshland. Dairy farming was relied upon to cover ground rents.\n\n===19th-century development===\nWith the completion of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] in 1790, the area began to attract ironstone and coal mining industry. The [[Carron Company]], became the areas's main employer, building the mining villages of Mavis Valley and Jellyhill to accommodate its workers. From there, the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] formed a convenient and direct transport link with their famous ironworks near [[Falkirk]]. There were also freestone quarries established at Coltpark ([[Colston]]), Crowhill, Huntershill and Kenmure.\n\nDevelopment during the 19th century was slow compared to the industrially-driven expansion of other nearby areas, such as [[Springburn]]. In 1836 Bishopbriggs' population stood at 175, compared to neighbouring [[Auchinairn]] Village's 284. [[Bishopbriggs railway station]] on the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]], opened in 1842 however, underlining its status as the emerging focus of the local area, although expansion remained slow throughout the latter half of the 19th century. The population of Bishopbriggs was recorded as 658 in 1861 and 782 in 1871.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/20672 |title=Gazetteer entries for Cadder |accessdate=2018-08-23 |author=Vision of Britain}}</ref> At the time, the village had also been known as 'Bishopbridges' and was so described in published maps up to the mid-1850s. The arrival of the railway heralded a change, although the first printed tickets called the station Bishopbridges, platform signage showed Bishopbriggs and it has remained so ever since.\n\n[[Cadder Yard]] (2&nbsp;km north of the Cross) became a major facility for the routing of freight and minerals on the line. Short spurs were constructed to link the various quarries (initially with the Forth & Clyde Canal) for transportation of minerals, very little evidence of this is visible today, but it is still possible to discover wooden sleepers in odd places. An underpass for the line which crosses under the A803 Kirkintilloch Road (at Hilton Road) was converted to a pedestrian subway and is one of the town's hidden gems. Also at Cadder Yard was a short spur that connected with Bishopbriggs Oil Terminal, used as a distribution point for West of Scotland deliveries before it ultimately closed in 1982.\n\n[[File:BriggsMap1923.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bishopbriggs and adjacent villages, circa 1923]]\nThe area continued to be a major centre for freestone quarrying during the 19th Century, supplying many major municipal building projects in Glasgow, such as [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]]'s new [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]] main building (the second largest [[Gothic Revival]] building in Britain). The blonde coloured Bishopbriggs Sandstone is from the Upper [[Limestone]] Formation of the Lower [[Carboniferous]] age. It was one of the most important Glasgow building stones, and was a major supplier of stone for Victorian Glasgow along with stone from quarries in other local areas such as [[Giffnock]]. Increasing demand for building stone and the emergence of the railways allowed for the additional transportation of red sandstone to Glasgow from quarries in [[Locharbriggs]] from the late 19th century onwards.\n\nThe blonde sandstone however was still considered to be of such value that in the 1850s when the depth of overburden became too great for opencast quarrying, it was mined using the traditional pillar and stall technique. Quarrying ceased in 1907 however after a fall at Huntershill killed several men.\n\n===20th-century development===\nThe [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow tramway]] network was extended north from Springburn to Bishopbriggs in 1903, with a terminus at Kirkintilloch Road close to traffic lights at what is now the Triangle Shopping Centre. As all trams were required to switch tracks (and direction) at a central crossover this proved dangerous as the levels of traffic on the main road increased. The tracks were eventually relocated and a new crossover created in a short spur which required all trams to turn left and terminate at Kenmure Avenue, where they changed direction and returned southwards to Glasgow. The tram service ceased across Glasgow in 1962.\n\nBishopbriggs suffered an economic decline in the early decades of the 20th century. With the working out of the quarries at that time, what mines the area had closed systematically thereafter, throughout the 1920s.\n\n[[File:SisterLaurasBW.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Sister Lauras Food Supplement]]]][[File:Wire Rope Co catalogue inside cover.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The Scottish Wire Rope Company was one of several firms that located in Bishopbriggs during the early 20th century.]] Manufacturing in the town began to grow after the [[First World War]], one of the manufacturers that located in Bishopbriggs at the time was a producer of [[Infant formula]], [[Sister Lauras Food Supplement]]. There were also engineering firms and the Scottish Wire Rope Company factory at Crowhill, [[Cadbury UK|Trebor Bassett]] at Huntershill, and Blackie and Sons Publishers at Cadder amongst those providing alternative employment.\n\nIn 1929, a new {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} printing works for [[Blackie and Son Limited|Blackie and Sons Publishers]] were erected on Kirkintilloch Road, retaining the name of their original [[Townhead]] works, 'The Villafield Press'. During the [[Second World War]], Blackie & Son Ltd used part of their Bishopbriggs works for the manufacture of [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|3.45\" shells]] for the [[Ministry of Supply]]. They also undertook some toolmaking for another Glasgow company, [[William Beardmore and Company]]; and, for a short time, produced aircraft radiators. By 1960 the publishing and administration section of the company also relocated from Townhead to join the printing section in Kirkintilloch Road, Bishopbriggs, and in 1971, new premises were occupied in Wester Cleddens Road, eventually becoming the headquarters of the company. The printworks were now no longer required and earmarked for demolition, following a demand for residential property in the area. The Villafield name was retained in the housing estate now on the site, opposite Cooper's Fine Fare supermarket (now Asda).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120731153201/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/blackie.html History of Blackie and Sons.]</ref>\n\nThe Robert McCarroll [[Plant Hire]] company was established at Crowhill in 1934 and continues to operate today.<ref>[http://www.robertmccarroll.com/history.html Robert McCarroll Limited - Company History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526003755/http://www.robertmccarroll.com/history.html |date=May 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the town saw the opening of its first (and only) cinema, The Kenmure. Located on Kirkintilloch Road it had an impressive towering facade and a single auditorium with capacity for 1000 patrons. Eventually the clientele dwindled after the arrival of television (in 1953) and by 1958 a decision was made to close it down. It lay derelict for a number of years, before being demolished to make way for the Churchill Way shopping centre which was constructed in 1962 (and demolished in 1993). The entrance to the cinema was where the Bishopbriggs Sub-Post Office is now located.\n\nProposals were also drawn up for the creation of a {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}} \"[[Garden city movement|Garden suburb]]\" at [[Cadder]] by [[Patrick Abercrombie]], under the instruction of [[Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, 10th Baronet|Sir John Stirling-Maxwell]] in 1936 but by the 1950s just 26 art deco [[bungalow]]s had been completed.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the town was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] at around midnight on 7 April 1941, as part of a series of raids on the [[Greater Glasgow]] area during early 1941, which included the notorious [[Clydebank Blitz]] some three weeks earlier. Approximately five bombs were dropped in the vicinity of South Crosshill Road. One fell behind Cadder Church Hall, an annex building of Bishopbriggs School (now the library) housing the junior school, that had been converted into an [[Air Raid Precautions]] first-aid post, received a direct hit, killing five staff instantly, along with four civilian residents of South Crosshill Road. Three ARP staff were also injured in the blast and died of their injuries at Lennox Castle Hospital in [[Lennoxtown]] the next day. The only strategic targets in the area were the railway and RAF Bishopbriggs (now Low Moss Prison), a barrage balloon depot established at Cadder in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkintilloch-herald.co.uk/news/Memories-still-haunt-nearly-70.5811152.jp |title=Memories still haunt nearly 70 years on |publisher=Kirkintilloch Herald |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, an unprecedented boost to the town's population came about as a result of the large-scale building programmes of the fifties and sixties which eventually replaced Balmuildy, Cadder and Woodhill farmlands with private housing, effectively amalgamating the various villages in the area into a single town, centred on the village of Bishopbriggs, increasing the population from 5,272 in 1951 to 21,000 in the early 1970s. The significant increase in local population was at least partially influenced by the recommendations of the [[Bruce Report]], which advocated the reduction of the population density of inner-city Glasgow and dispersal of its population to the outskirts and suburbs of the city.\n\nAgriculture continued to diminish in importance throughout the 20th century as demand for residential development grew; in 1920 there were 31 working farms in the area, in 1948 that number had fallen to 24 and by 1989 there were only 13 left.\n\n==Modern Bishopbriggs==\n===Bishopbriggs Cross===\n[[File:Bishopbriggs Cross - geograph.org.uk - 409245.jpg|thumb|left|View of Bishopbriggs Cross looking north along [[Kirkintilloch]] Road from the junction with Crowhill Road.]]\nThe [[Town centre]] is known as 'The Village', 'Bishopbriggs Cross' or simply 'The Cross'. The principal retail areas are the Triangle Shopping Centre and the Cross Court. The Triangle Shopping Centre was created via the demolition of older tenement housing stock and the Kenmure Church Hall on the eastern side of Kirkintilloch Road to facilitate the construction of new development called 'The Triangle' so called due to the shape of the available land.

The new building for Bishopbriggs Academy was scheduled to be built at the site of the old Bishopbriggs High School campus near Bishopbriggs Cross. However, after representations from the contractors, it was relocated to the former Thomas Muir High School site at Woodhill. The decision to change the location of the new school went against public opinion and caused significant local controversy at the time. The relocation has, however, made a large area of land adjacent to the Cross available for redevelopment.\n\nIn addition to these schools, there is also St Mary's on the edge of Bishopbriggs, which is a secure residential school for [[Young offender]]s on remand, under sentence and Children's Panel Orders.

Following local government reorganisation, dissolution of the burgh system, and the creation of Regional and District Authorities, as a result of the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], Bishopbriggs became part of the [[Strathclyde]] Region in 1975. The local Ratepayers Association again played a major role in keeping Bishopbriggs outwith Glasgow district and within the [[Strathkelvin]] district of the Strathclyde Region, along with [[Kirkintilloch]] and [[Lenzie]].\n\nWith the introduction of the present [[Local government in Scotland|unitary local government system]] in 1996, and the dissolution of the Regional and District setup, as a result of the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], Bishopbriggs became part of the [[East Dunbartonshire]] Council area.

Although entirely [[Scots language|Scots]] in origin, some prefer the explanation that it was named after 'the Bishop's Bridge', supposedly that over the Callie [[Burn (stream)|Burn]] that runs through Bishopbriggs Park. Early 19c engraved maps show the settlement as 'Bishopbridges'. However others believed the middle 'b' was a corruption. This, so the argument goes, appeared because it rolls off the tongue more easily than the claimed original name of 'Bishop's Riggs'. In this alternative ''[[Run rig|riggs]]'' refers to the lands which the [[Bishop of Glasgow]] raised [[teinds]] from.\n\n==Transport==\n===Air===\n[[Glasgow International Airport]], at [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], is the nearest commercial airport serving the [[Greater Glasgow]] region, however a private landing strip at [[Cumbernauld Airport]] services smaller aircraft and helicopters.\n\n===Road===\nBishopbriggs is connected to the UK motorway network at Junction 2 of the [[M80 motorway]] at [[Robroyston]]. This interchange connects with the Bishopbriggs Relief Road that runs from Robroyston, [[Bypass (road)|bypassing]] Bishopbriggs to the east of Woodhill and Westerhill before linking up with the Torrance Roundabout near Low Moss. The main road through Bishopbriggs itself is Kirkintilloch Road, part of the [[A803 road|A803]] which connects Glasgow to Falkirk and Grangemouth.\n\n===Rail===\nThe town is served by [[Bishopbriggs railway station]], and is the first stop for local trains departing from [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street station]] on the [[Croy Line]] to Stirling. All rail services are provided by [[Abellio ScotRail]].  Journey time to Glasgow is 9 minutes.\n\n===Canal===\nThe Bishopbriggs section of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] opened in 1775 and when completed, connected the [[River Clyde]], at [[Bowling, West Dunbartonshire|Bowling]], to the [[River Forth]], at [[Grangemouth]]. Junctions at [[Falkirk]] with the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] and at [[Maryhill]] to the [[Monkland Canal]] completed the network. The canal reopened in 2003 to non-commercial navigation as part of the Millennium Project. This included the newly reconstructed Farm Bridge over the Canal at Mavis Valley, adjacent to the Leisuredrome. The previous fixed [[Girder bridge]] replaced an older [[Bascule bridge]], and was built after the closure of the canal in 1962. It had been set at a very low level, inhibiting canal navigation. Farm Bridge was also known as \"Brash's Bridge\", because members of the Brash family held the post of bridge-keeper for over a century, from 1838 to 1942. Brash's bridge-house was on the north bank of the canal, beside the bridge. The only other Bridge across the canal in Bishopbriggs is at Cadder.\n\n===Bus===\nBus services provide services through the Kelvin Valley (Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth), long-distance services to Stirling and Falkirk were discontinued on 2017. Bus companies include [[First Glasgow]] in addition to a local circular service 142 from [[Glasgow Citybus]] (previously operated by John Morrow Coaches) that runs a local route around the town linking the Cross, Mavis Valley, Cadder, Strathkelvin Retail Park, Woodhill and Auchinairn from 0800 to 1700 Mon-Fri. Additional services 147 (to Scotstoun) and 148 (to Clydebank) are infrequent and used only to facilitate trips to the bus depot. Defunct operator [[Kelvin Scottish]] Buses had their headquarters in the town at Westerhill Road.\n\n==Twin towns==\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Corbeil-Essonnes]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Japan}} [[Yoichi, Hokkaido|Yoichi]], [[Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.glasgowguide.co.uk/images_bishopbriggs_01.html Images of Bishopbriggs]\n* [http://www.eastdunbarton.gov.uk/ East Dunbartonshire Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091123024343/http://www.huntershillvillage.com/ Huntershill Village]\n* [http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/sumdep.aspx?T=BBG Live train departure information]\n\n{{East Dunbartonshire Settlements}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Burghs]]\n[[Category:Bishopbriggs| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in East Dunbartonshire]]\n", "name_user": "Elshad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Added Commons category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopbriggs"}

The structure is {{convert|347.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[structural height|high]]. An antenna increases the pinnacle height to {{convert|378|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Constructed from 1994 to 1997, it is the tallest skyscraper in Kaohsiung, and was the [[list of tallest buildings in Taiwan|tallest in Taiwan]] until the completion of [[Taipei 101]] in 2004.\n\nThere is no 44th floor in the building (see [[Tetraphobia]]); the 43rd floor connects directly to the 45th floor. The [[pyramid]] shaped crown is the equivalent of three stories high and is hence marketed as 83-85 to arrive at a round number. There is no elevator access to floors above 80. \n\nThe building was designed by [[C.Y. Lee & Partners]] and [[Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum]], and has an unusual 'prong' design with two separate 39-floor sections, which merge into a single central tower rising to a spire. This unique design leaves a substantial space below the central part of the tower. The design was inspired by the first [[Kanji]] and [[Chinese character]] of the city's name (changed to {{nihongo||{{linktext|\u9ad8\u96c4}}|Takao|lead=yes}} during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]). John W. Milton was Project Director on behalf of Turner International Inc. (New York), a subsidiary of [[Turner Construction]].\n\nThe building was owned by the now defunct [[Tuntex Group]], and is mainly offices, but includes residential space, and a department store; and the 85 Sky Tower Hotel occupies the 38th to 70th floors. An observation deck on the 74th floor offers views over Kaohsiung City, the Love River and Kaohsiung Harbor; it is accessed by high speed [[elevator]]s that are capable of speeds of 10.17&nbsp;m/s.\n\n== Occupancy ==\nFloor 34 and 35 are currently leased by Look Hotel Group ({{zh|t=\u6a02\u6d3b\u5546\u65c5\u79df}}). The '''85 Sky Tower Hotel''' ({{zh|t=\u541b\u9d3b\u570b\u969b\u9152\u5e97}}) occupies floors 37 to 85, and it owns the observation deck.
