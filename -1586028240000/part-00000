The Northstars are affiliated with the ice hockey club of the same name and have won six [[Goodall Cup|Goodall Cups]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===1977\u20132001 (Pre-AIHL)===\n\nIce hockey started in the city of Newcastle in the 1970s, at the old boxing stadium where Marketown is now situated.\nOriginally the Newcastle Red Wings, the Red Wings were part of national leagues of the time. Due to instability there were several variations of these leagues. The Red Wings became the North Stars in 1978 and were leading the national 'Super League' at the time when the Newcastle ice rink went into liquidation in late 1982.<ref name=\"NORTHEARLYYEARS\">{{cite web | url = https://www.newcastlestar.com.au/story/210012/champion-garry-dore-to-lead-newcastle-north-stars/ | title = Champion Garry Dore to lead Newcastle North Stars | publisher=[[Newcastle Star]] | first=Ellie-Marie | last=Watts | date=3 April 2012 | accessdate = 4 February 2020 }}</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Newcastle North Stars Logo.png|thumb|left|Newcastle Northstars original logo from 2002]] -->\nSome players then retired, while others went on to play for teams in Sydney or join [[inline hockey]] teams that started in the 1990s in Newcastle. A Newcastle North Stars in-line hockey team was formed including former members of the defunct Wharf Road team.<ref name=\"NORTHEARLYYEARS\"/>\n\nIn 2000 the Hunter Ice Skating Stadium (a.k.a. HISS) opened at 230 Macquarie Road, Warners Bay. The Lake Macquarie suburb, only 15&nbsp;km from the city, proved an ideal location for the new rink.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurohockey.com/arena/1288-hunter-ice-skating-stadium-warners-bay.html | title = Hunter Ice Skating Stadium Warners Bay | publisher=www.eurohockey.com | first= | last= | date= | accessdate = 2015-07-31 }}</ref> The rink opened with former North Stars player/coach Garry Dor\u00e9 as general manager.<ref name=\"NORTHEARLYYEARS\"/>\n\nA local committee was established and the Newcastle Northstars Ice Hockey Club was registered in 2001. The team mostly consisted of Canadian [[expatriates]] along with four talented local-born players contested the New South Wales Senior B championship. The Senior B North Stars went on to win the state Senior B Championship for 2001.\n\nLater in 2001 the Hunter Ice Skating Stadium hosted the [[Goodall Cup]] tournament. The Goodall Cup is Australia's senior men's national tournament, contested since 1909. Utilising the experience from running the tournament and gaining assistance from existing AIHL teams, rink general manager Garry Dor\u00e9 began building a team ready for the [[Australian Ice Hockey League]].

(Clement had died in 1740 and Vico in 1744, before the edition's publication.)\n\n==Creation==\nIn 1720, Vico began work on the ''Scienza Nuova'' as part of a treatise on [[universal rights]]. Although it was originally supposed to be sponsored by Cardinal Corsini, Vico was forced to finance the publication himself after the cardinal pleaded financial difficulty and withdrew his patronage. It was the first work by Vico to be written in Italian, since his previous ones had been in Latin.\n\nThe first edition of the ''New Science'' appeared in 1725. Vico worked on two heavily revised editions. The first was published in 1730, the second posthumously in 1744.\n\n==Approach, style and tone==\nIn its first section, titled \"Idea of the Work\" (''{{lang|it|Idea dell'Opera}}''), the 1730 and 1744 editions of ''The New Science'' explicitly present themselves as a \"science of reasoning\" (''{{lang|it|scienza di ragionare}}'').  The work (especially the section \"Of the Elements\") includes a dialectic between axioms (authoritative maxims or ''{{lang|it|degnit\u00e0}}'') and \"reasonings\" (''{{lang|it|ragionamenti}}'') linking and clarifying the axioms.\n\nVico began the third edition with a detailed close reading of a front piece portrait, examining the place of [[Gentiles|Gentile]] nations within the [[divine providence|providential guidance]] of the [[YHWH|Hebrew God]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Science of Giambattista Vico|last=Bergin & Fisch (translators)|first=|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1948, 1961, 168, 1976|isbn=0-8014-9265-3|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/7 7\u201310, 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/7}}</ref> This portrait contains a number of images that are symbolically ascribed to the flow of human history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/33797/Image%201.jpg?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Front-piece|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A triangle with the [[Eye of Providence]] appears in the top left.

They naturally desire these laws to bend benignly to the least details of matters calling for equal unity.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Science of Giambattista Vico|last=Bergin & Fisch (translators)|first=|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1948, 1961, 168, 1976|isbn=0-8014-9265-3|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/24}}</ref>\n\nVico specifies that his \"science\" reasons primarily about the function of religion in the human world (\"Idea of the Work\"), and in this respect the work \"comes to be a civil theology reasoned from divine providence\" (''{{lang|it|vien ad essere una teologia civile ragionata della provvidenza divina}}'').  Reconsidering divine providence within a human or political context, Vico unearths the \"poetic theologians\" (''{{lang|it|poeti teologi}}'') of pagan antiquity, exposing the poetic character of theology independently of [[Christianity]]'s sacred history and thus of Biblical authority.<ref>See, e.g. the 1744 edition's \"Of the Elements,\" CXIV.</ref>  Vico's use of poetic theology, anticipated in his 1710 work ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'' (\"On the Ancient Wisdom of the Italians\"), confirms his ties to the Italian Renaissance and its own appeals to ''{{lang|la|[[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]}}''.  With the early Renaissance, Vico shares the call for recovering a \"pagan\" or \"vulgar\" horizon for philosophy's providential agency or for recognizing the providence of our human \"metaphysical\" minds (''{{lang|it|menti}}'') in the world of our \"political\" wills (''{{lang|it|animi}}''.<ref>\"Idea of the Work,\" par. 2.</ref> \"Poetic theology\" would serve as stage for an \"ascent\" to recognize the inherence or latency of rational agency in our actions, even when these are brutal.<ref>See \"Of the Method,\" par. 2.</ref>  This way, the particular providence of the Bible's \"true God\"<ref>\"Of the Elements,\" CXIV.</ref> would not be required for the thriving of properly human life.  All that would be needed was (A) false religions and gods and (B) the covert work of the ''{{lang|la|conatus}}'' (the rational principle of a constitution of experience rooted in its proper infinite form), which was examined at length in ''{{lang|la|De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia}}'' and evoked again in the section \"Of the Method\" in the 1730 and 1744 editions of ''The New Science''.<ref>Par. 2.</ref>\n\n==Cyclical history (''Corsi e ricorsi''?)==\nVico is often seen as espousing a cyclical philosophy of history where human history is created by man, although Vico never speaks of \"history without attributes\" (Paolo Cristofolini, ''Vice Pagano e Barbaro''), but of a \"world of nations\".  Which is more, in the 1744 ''Scienza Nuova'' (esp. the \"Conclusion of the Work\") Vico stresses that \"the world of nations\" is made by men merely with respect to their sense of certainty (''certamente''), though not fundamentally, insofar as the world is guided by the human mind \"metaphysically\" independent of its makings (compare opening paragraph of the ''Scienza Nuova'').  Furthermore, although Vico is often attributed the expression \"''corsi e ricorsi''\" (cycles and counter cycles) of \"history\", he never speaks in the plural of \"the cycle\" or of \"the counter-cycle\" (''ricorso'') of \"human things\", suggesting that political life and order, or human creations, are oriented \"backward,\" as it were, or called back to their constitutive \"metaphysical\" principle.\n\nOn present day \"constructivist\" readings, Vico is supposed to have promoted a vision of man and society as moving in parallel from barbarism to civilization.<blockquote>As societies become more developed socially, human nature also develops, and both manifest their development in changes in language, myth, folklore, economy, etc.; in short, social change produces cultural change.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 0710077467|location = London|pages = [https://archive.org/details/knowledgesocials0000hami/page/5 5]|url = https://archive.org/details/knowledgesocials0000hami/page/5}}</ref></blockquote>Vico would therefore be using an original organic idea that culture is a system of socially produced and structured elements.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, knowledge of any society would come from the social structure of that society, explicable, therefore, only in terms of its own language. As such, one may find a dialectical relationship between language, knowledge and social structure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRelying on a complex etymology, Vico argues in the ''Scienza Nuova'' that civilization develops in a recurring cycle (''ricorso'') of three ages: the divine, the heroic, and the human. Each age exhibits distinct political and social features and can be characterized by master [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] or [[figure of speech|figures of language]]. The ''[[Gigantes|giganti]]'' of the divine age rely on [[metaphor]] to compare, and thus comprehend, human and natural phenomena. In the heroic age, [[metonymy]] and [[synecdoche]] support the development of [[feudal]] or [[monarchic]] institutions embodied by idealized figures. The final age is characterized by popular [[democracy]] and reflection via [[irony]]; in this epoch, the rise of [[rationality]] leads to ''barbarie della reflessione'' or barbarism of reflection, and civilization descends once more into the poetic era. Taken together, the recurring cycle of three ages{{spaced ndash}}common to every nation{{spaced ndash}}constitutes for Vico a ''storia ideale eterna'' or ideal eternal history. Therefore, it can be said that all history is the history of the rise and fall of civilizations, for which Vico provides evidence (up until, and including the Graeco-Roman historians).\n\n==Ideas on rhetoric applied to history==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nVico\u2019s humanism (his returning to a pre-modern form of reasoning), his interest in classical rhetoric and [[philology]], and his response to Descartes contribute to the philosophical foundations for the second ''Scienza Nuova''. Through an elaborate Latin etymology, Vico establishes not only the distinguishing features of first humans, but also how early civilization developed out of a ''sensus communis'' or common (not collective) sense. Beginning with the first form of authority intuited by the ''giganti'' or early humans and transposed in their first \"mute\" or \"sign\" language, Vico concludes that \u201cfirst, or vulgar, wisdom was poetic in nature.\u201d This observation is not an [[aesthetic]] one, but rather points to the capacity inherent in all men to imagine meaning via comparison and to reach a communal \"conscience\" or \"prejudice\" about their surroundings.  The metaphors that define the poetic age gradually yield to the first civic discourse, finally leading to a time characterized by \"full-fledged reason\" (''ragione tutta spiegata''), in which reason and right are exposed to the point that they vanish into their own superficial appearance.  At this point, speech returns to its primitive condition, and with it men.  Hence the \"recurring\" (''ricorso'') of life to \"barbarism\" (''barbarie'').  It is by way of warning his age and those stemming from it of the danger of seeking truth in clear and distinct ideas blinding us to the real depths of life, that Vico calls our attention back to a classical art of moderating the course of human things, lest the liberty enjoyed in the \"Republic\" be supplanted by the anarchic tyranny of the senses.\n\nCrucial to Vico's work remains a subtle criticism of all attempts to impose universality upon particularity, as if ''ex nihilo''. Instead, Vico attempts to always let \"the true\" emerge from \"the certain\" through innumerable stories and anecdotes drawn mostly from the history of [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]] and from the [[Bible]]. Here, reason does not attempt to overcome the poetic dimension of life and speech, but to moderate its impulses so as to safeguard civil life.\n\nWhile the transfer from divine to heroic to human ages is, for Vico, marked by shifts in the [[tropological]] nature of language, the inventional aspect of the poetic principle remains constant. When referring to \u201cpoets\u201d, Vico intends to evoke the original Greek sense of \u201ccreators\u201d. In the ''Scienza Nuova'', then, the ''verum factum'' principle first put forth in ''De Italorum Sapientia'' remains central. As such, the notion of topics as the ''loci'' or places of invention (put forth by Aristotle and developed throughout classical rhetoric) serves as the foundation for \"the true\", and thus, as the underlying principle of ''sensus communis'' and civic discourse. The development of laws that shape the social and political character of each age is informed as much by master tropes as by those topics deemed acceptable in each era. Thus, for the rudimentary civilization of the divine age, sensory topics are employed to develop laws applicable on an individual basis. These laws expand as metonymy and synecdoche enable notions of sovereign rule in the heroic age; accordingly, acceptable topics expand to include notions of [[Social class|class]] and division. In the final, human age, the reflection that enables popular democracy requires appeals to any and all topics to achieve a common, rational law that is universally applicable. The development of civilization in Vico\u2019s ''storia ideale eterna'', then, is rooted in the first [[Western canon|canon]] of rhetoric, as invention via ''loci'' shapes both the creation of and discourse about civil life.\n\n==Reception and later influence==\nVico\u2019s major work was poorly received during his own life but has since inspired a [[En cadre|cadre]] of famous thinkers and artists, including [[Karl Marx]] and [[Montesquieu]].<ref>[[Reiner Grundmann]], 1991. ''Marxism and Ecology''. Oxford University Press</ref> Later his work was received more favourably as in the case of [[Lord Monboddo]] to whom he was compared in a modern treatise.<ref>Hobbs, Catherine, ''Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Monboddo]]'', Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (1992)</ref>\n\n[[Isaiah Berlin]] has devoted attention to Vico as a critic of the Enlightenment and a significant humanist and culture theorist.<ref>Berlin, Isaiah, ''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas'', Chatto and Windus, 1976. Redwood Burn Ltd.. {{ISBN|0-7011-2512-8}}.</ref><ref>Berlin, Isaiah, ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder'', Pimlico, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7126-6492-0}}.</ref>\n\n''Scienza Nuova'' was included by [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] in his book ''[[The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]''.\n\nThe historical cycle provides the structure for [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] book, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. The intertextual relationship between ''Scienza Nuova'' and ''Finnegans Wake'' was brought to light by [[Samuel Beckett]] in his essay \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\u201d published in ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (1929), where Beckett argued that Vico's conception of language also had significant influence in Joyce's work. Vico's notion of the ''lingua mentale commune'' (mental dictionary) in relation to ''universale fantastico'' reverberates in Joyce's novel, which ends in the middle of a sentence, reasserting Vico's principle of cyclical history.<ref>Verene, Donald Phillip.

(Clement had died in 1740 and Vico in 1744, before the edition's publication.)\n\n==Creation==\nIn 1720, Vico began work on the ''Scienza Nuova'' as part of a treatise on [[universal rights]]. Although it was originally supposed to be sponsored by Cardinal Corsini, Vico was forced to finance the publication himself after the cardinal pleaded financial difficulty and withdrew his patronage. It was the first work by Vico to be written in Italian, since his previous ones had been in Latin.\n\nThe first edition of the ''New Science'' appeared in 1725. Vico worked on two heavily revised editions. The first was published in 1730, the second posthumously in 1744.\n\n==Approach, style and tone==\nIn its first section, titled \"Idea of the Work\" (''{{lang|it|Idea dell'Opera}}''), the 1730 and 1744 editions of ''The New Science'' explicitly present themselves as a \"science of reasoning\" (''{{lang|it|scienza di ragionare}}'').  The work (especially the section \"Of the Elements\") includes a dialectic between axioms (authoritative maxims or ''{{lang|it|degnit\u00e0}}'') and \"reasonings\" (''{{lang|it|ragionamenti}}'') linking and clarifying the axioms.\n\nVico began the third edition with a detailed close reading of a front piece portrait, examining the place of [[Gentiles|Gentile]] nations within the [[divine providence|providential guidance]] of the [[YHWH|Hebrew God]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Science of Giambattista Vico|last=Bergin & Fisch (translators)|first=|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1948, 1961, 168, 1976|isbn=0-8014-9265-3|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/7 7\u201310, 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/7}}</ref> This portrait contains a number of images that are symbolically ascribed to the flow of human history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/33797/Image%201.jpg?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Front-piece|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A triangle with the [[Eye of Providence]] appears in the top left.

According to Vico, the proper end for government resulted with society entering into a state of universal equity: \u201cThe last type of jurisprudence was that of natural equity, which reigns naturally in the free commonwealths, in which the people, each for his own particular good (without understanding that it is the same for all), are led to command universal laws. They naturally desire these laws to bend benignly to the least details of matters calling for equal unity.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Science of Giambattista Vico|last=Bergin & Fisch (translators)|first=|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1948, 1961, 168, 1976|isbn=0-8014-9265-3|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/newscienceofgiam00vico_1/page/24}}</ref>\n\nVico specifies that his \"science\" reasons primarily about the function of religion in the human world (\"Idea of the Work\"), and in this respect the work \"comes to be a civil theology reasoned from divine providence\" (''{{lang|it|vien ad essere una teologia civile ragionata della provvidenza divina}}'').  Reconsidering divine providence within a human or political context, Vico unearths the \"poetic theologians\" (''{{lang|it|poeti teologi}}'') of pagan antiquity, exposing the poetic character of theology independently of [[Christianity]]'s sacred history and thus of Biblical authority.<ref>See, e.g. the 1744 edition's \"Of the Elements,\" CXIV.</ref>  Vico's use of poetic theology, anticipated in his 1710 work ''De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia'' (\"On the Ancient Wisdom of the Italians\"), confirms his ties to the Italian Renaissance and its own appeals to ''{{lang|la|[[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]}}''.  With the early Renaissance, Vico shares the call for recovering a \"pagan\" or \"vulgar\" horizon for philosophy's providential agency or for recognizing the providence of our human \"metaphysical\" minds (''{{lang|it|menti}}'') in the world of our \"political\" wills (''{{lang|it|animi}}''.<ref>\"Idea of the Work,\" par. 2.</ref> \"Poetic theology\" would serve as stage for an \"ascent\" to recognize the inherence or latency of rational agency in our actions, even when these are brutal.<ref>See \"Of the Method,\" par. 2.</ref>  This way, the particular providence of the Bible's \"true God\"<ref>\"Of the Elements,\" CXIV.</ref> would not be required for the thriving of properly human life.  All that would be needed was (A) false religions and gods and (B) the covert work of the ''{{lang|la|conatus}}'' (the rational principle of a constitution of experience rooted in its proper infinite form), which was examined at length in ''{{lang|la|De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia}}'' and evoked again in the section \"Of the Method\" in the 1730 and 1744 editions of ''The New Science''.<ref>Par. 2.</ref>\n\n==Cyclical history (''Corsi e ricorsi''?)==\nVico is often seen as espousing a cyclical philosophy of history where human history is created by man, although Vico never speaks of \"history without attributes\" (Paolo Cristofolini, ''Vice Pagano e Barbaro''), but of a \"world of nations\".  Which is more, in the 1744 ''Scienza Nuova'' (esp. the \"Conclusion of the Work\") Vico stresses that \"the world of nations\" is made by men merely with respect to their sense of certainty (''certamente''), though not fundamentally, insofar as the world is guided by the human mind \"metaphysically\" independent of its makings (compare opening paragraph of the ''Scienza Nuova'').  Furthermore, although Vico is often attributed the expression \"''corsi e ricorsi''\" (cycles and counter cycles) of \"history\", he never speaks in the plural of \"the cycle\" or of \"the counter-cycle\" (''ricorso'') of \"human things\", suggesting that political life and order, or human creations, are oriented \"backward,\" as it were, or called back to their constitutive \"metaphysical\" principle.\n\nOn present day \"constructivist\" readings, Vico is supposed to have promoted a vision of man and society as moving in parallel from barbarism to civilization.<blockquote>As societies become more developed socially, human nature also develops, and both manifest their development in changes in language, myth, folklore, economy, etc.; in short, social change produces cultural change.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 0710077467|location = London|pages = [https://archive.org/details/knowledgesocials0000hami/page/5 5]|url = https://archive.org/details/knowledgesocials0000hami/page/5}}</ref></blockquote>Vico would therefore be using an original organic idea that culture is a system of socially produced and structured elements.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, knowledge of any society would come from the social structure of that society, explicable, therefore, only in terms of its own language. As such, one may find a dialectical relationship between language, knowledge and social structure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRelying on a complex etymology, Vico argues in the ''Scienza Nuova'' that civilization develops in a recurring cycle (''ricorso'') of three ages: the divine, the heroic, and the human. Each age exhibits distinct political and social features and can be characterized by master [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] or [[figure of speech|figures of language]]. The ''[[Gigantes|giganti]]'' of the divine age rely on [[metaphor]] to compare, and thus comprehend, human and natural phenomena. In the heroic age, [[metonymy]] and [[synecdoche]] support the development of [[feudal]] or [[monarchic]] institutions embodied by idealized figures. The final age is characterized by popular [[democracy]] and reflection via [[irony]]; in this epoch, the rise of [[rationality]] leads to ''barbarie della reflessione'' or barbarism of reflection, and civilization descends once more into the poetic era. Taken together, the recurring cycle of three ages{{spaced ndash}}common to every nation{{spaced ndash}}constitutes for Vico a ''storia ideale eterna'' or ideal eternal history. Therefore, it can be said that all history is the history of the rise and fall of civilizations, for which Vico provides evidence (up until, and including the Graeco-Roman historians).\n\n==Ideas on rhetoric applied to history==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nVico\u2019s humanism (his returning to a pre-modern form of reasoning), his interest in classical rhetoric and [[philology]], and his response to Descartes contribute to the philosophical foundations for the second ''Scienza Nuova''. Through an elaborate Latin etymology, Vico establishes not only the distinguishing features of first humans, but also how early civilization developed out of a ''sensus communis'' or common (not collective) sense. Beginning with the first form of authority intuited by the ''giganti'' or early humans and transposed in their first \"mute\" or \"sign\" language, Vico concludes that \u201cfirst, or vulgar, wisdom was poetic in nature.\u201d This observation is not an [[aesthetic]] one, but rather points to the capacity inherent in all men to imagine meaning via comparison and to reach a communal \"conscience\" or \"prejudice\" about their surroundings.  The metaphors that define the poetic age gradually yield to the first civic discourse, finally leading to a time characterized by \"full-fledged reason\" (''ragione tutta spiegata''), in which reason and right are exposed to the point that they vanish into their own superficial appearance.  At this point, speech returns to its primitive condition, and with it men.  Hence the \"recurring\" (''ricorso'') of life to \"barbarism\" (''barbarie'').  It is by way of warning his age and those stemming from it of the danger of seeking truth in clear and distinct ideas blinding us to the real depths of life, that Vico calls our attention back to a classical art of moderating the course of human things, lest the liberty enjoyed in the \"Republic\" be supplanted by the anarchic tyranny of the senses.\n\nCrucial to Vico's work remains a subtle criticism of all attempts to impose universality upon particularity, as if ''ex nihilo''. Instead, Vico attempts to always let \"the true\" emerge from \"the certain\" through innumerable stories and anecdotes drawn mostly from the history of [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]] and from the [[Bible]]. Here, reason does not attempt to overcome the poetic dimension of life and speech, but to moderate its impulses so as to safeguard civil life.\n\nWhile the transfer from divine to heroic to human ages is, for Vico, marked by shifts in the [[tropological]] nature of language, the inventional aspect of the poetic principle remains constant. When referring to \u201cpoets\u201d, Vico intends to evoke the original Greek sense of \u201ccreators\u201d. In the ''Scienza Nuova'', then, the ''verum factum'' principle first put forth in ''De Italorum Sapientia'' remains central. As such, the notion of topics as the ''loci'' or places of invention (put forth by Aristotle and developed throughout classical rhetoric) serves as the foundation for \"the true\", and thus, as the underlying principle of ''sensus communis'' and civic discourse. The development of laws that shape the social and political character of each age is informed as much by master tropes as by those topics deemed acceptable in each era. Thus, for the rudimentary civilization of the divine age, sensory topics are employed to develop laws applicable on an individual basis. These laws expand as metonymy and synecdoche enable notions of sovereign rule in the heroic age; accordingly, acceptable topics expand to include notions of [[Social class|class]] and division. In the final, human age, the reflection that enables popular democracy requires appeals to any and all topics to achieve a common, rational law that is universally applicable. The development of civilization in Vico\u2019s ''storia ideale eterna'', then, is rooted in the first [[Western canon|canon]] of rhetoric, as invention via ''loci'' shapes both the creation of and discourse about civil life.\n\n==Reception and later influence==\nVico\u2019s major work was poorly received during his own life but has since inspired a [[En cadre|cadre]] of famous thinkers and artists, including [[Karl Marx]] and [[Montesquieu]].<ref>[[Reiner Grundmann]], 1991. ''Marxism and Ecology''. Oxford University Press</ref> Later his work was received more favourably as in the case of [[Lord Monboddo]] to whom he was compared in a modern treatise.<ref>Hobbs, Catherine, ''Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Monboddo]]'', Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (1992)</ref>\n\n[[Isaiah Berlin]] has devoted attention to Vico as a critic of the Enlightenment and a significant humanist and culture theorist.<ref>Berlin, Isaiah, ''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas'', Chatto and Windus, 1976.

The intertextual relationship between ''Scienza Nuova'' and ''Finnegans Wake'' was brought to light by [[Samuel Beckett]] in his essay \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\u201d published in ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (1929), where Beckett argued that Vico's conception of language also had significant influence in Joyce's work. Vico's notion of the ''lingua mentale commune'' (mental dictionary) in relation to ''universale fantastico'' reverberates in Joyce's novel, which ends in the middle of a sentence, reasserting Vico's principle of cyclical history.<ref>Verene, Donald Phillip.

With a length of 59m the church is one of the longest in [[Ireland]]. The visitor centre is run by the current [[Marquess of Donegall]] and has one of only two full sized hedge mazes in Ireland.\n\nThe abbey was dissolved under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The last Abbot of Dunbrody was Alexander Devereux, who became [[Bishop of Ferns]] in 1539.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1169 a contingent of Norman knights led by [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|the King of Leinster, Dermot MacMurrough]], invaded Ireland, first conquering the Irish province of Leinster then all of Ireland. In 1171 [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] led a much larger force into Ireland, taking control and making Ireland a territory of England. [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], one of the important figures in the Norman Conquest, instructed his uncle Herve de Montmorency to found a Cistercian monastery in the County Wexford.<ref name=\"Leroux-Dhuys, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois 1998. P178\">Leroux-Dhuys, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois. Cistercian Abbeys. Konemann, 1998. P178</ref> Montmorency donated the allotted land to the English Cistercian [[Buildwas Abbey|Abbey of Buildwas]]. The Abbey of Buildwas sent a lay brother to survey the land and, after an unfavorable report, Buildwas turned down the gift. The property was then offered to [[St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin|St. Mary\u2019s Cistercian Abbey]] in Dublin, which was in the filial line of Clairvaux.<ref name=\"Leroux-Dhuys, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois 1998. P178\"/> The monks of St. Mary\u2019s were delighted with their new land and they soon sent a community to the site in 1182. Due to its position near a major maritime transportation route, the abbey was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with the name Port of St. Mary\u2019s, because of the safety the abbey offered to people in trouble.\n\nThe middle of the 13th century was a boom period for the Anglo-Norman colony in Ireland and the Cistercian order shared in this prosperity. The scale and quality of the 13th century buildings constructed at Dunbrody gives a general hint of confidence and well being. The spacious early Gothic church was built sometime around 1210&ndash;1240 for the monks of Dunbrody Abbey. Dunbrody, though a relatively small abbey, was very successful until the 16th century and the rise of King Henry VIII. Following his split with the Church of Rome, Henry VIII issued the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] through a series of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541. Dunbrody was part of the first round of suppressions in Ireland and was officially dissolved in 1536. The abbey was plundered and made unfit for monks to return. The lead from the roof was melted down by using the wood from the roof. Nine years later, Sir [[Edward Echyngham#Death and legacy|Osborne Echyngham]] was given the land and the monastery which he converted into a residence. Owing to the neglect of the private owners of Dunbrody, a massive collapse occurred on Christmas Eve 1852, destroying the south wall of the church and some of the monastery. The abbey lies in ruins until this day.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Plan of Dunbrody Abbey in Wexford, Ireland.jpg|thumbnail|right|Floor plan of the abbey.]]\nThe church is in the form of a cross on plan, as is usual in Cistercian Abbeys, and has a [[nave]], [[Aisle|side aisles]], [[Transept|north and south transepts]], and [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. Apartments were formed in the roof over the chapels in the transepts (each transept has three [[chapel]]s), one over the north transept (left transept on the plan) was approached by the circular stairs and a passage across the [[triforium]] of the north transept. There is also evidence of a floor having at one time been carried over the whole of the north transept. The space over the side chapels of the south transept contained a fireplace and five windows, and over it another floor, probably divided into two apartments, as it contains two fireplaces and has also five windows.<ref name=\"DB1910\">Extract of Historical and Descriptive Notes Of Dunbrody Abbey, 1910</ref>\n\nThe nave was separated from the aisles by an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of five [[Bay (architecture)|bays]]. In the north aisle are four large [[buttress]]es; it is entirely owing to these buttresses that this wall is preserved. The south arcade and the wall of the south aisle fell in a storm on Christmas Eve 1852. The nave was lit by a row a [[clerestory]] windows and also three [[Light (window)|lights]] that formed the large west window.<ref name=\"DB1910\"/>\n\nA very remarkable feature is shown in the construction of the [[Belfry (architecture)|bell tower]]. The rules of the Order did not originally permit the erection of a tower, but this prohibition was later removed. In many other similar structures the original transept arches have been used to carry the walls of a tower, however in this case the old arches were not built upon, but new [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] were built alongside the old, and new arches were formed at the nave and choir, and in this way the stability of the tower was secured. \nThere were seven bells in the tower plan, indicated by the seven openings for the bell ropes to the ringing chamber through the vault carrying the floor of the tower. There was also a large opening square through which the bells were hoisted.<ref name=\"DB1910\"/>\n\nThe range of buildings east of the [[cloister]] garth and south of the church comprises the [[sacristy]] and an inner room opening off it. There is here a small apartment with a door giving access from the cloister walk. This apartment, which is usually found in monasteries of this Order, is sometimes described as a prison, but is more likely to have been the book store, a convenient place for keeping books to read in the cloisters. There were several more apartments southwards including the [[parlour]] and [[chapter room]], and over the whole of this range the [[Dormitory|dormitories]] extended, approached by the night stairs in the south transept, and at the other end by the stairs in the passage at the south-east angle of the cloister enclosure.<ref name=\"DB1910\"/>\n\nIn the southern range of buildings there is evidence of the position of the [[refectory]] by the indication of the reader's desk at one of the windows in south side wall. Although this range is not now divided by cross walls, it is likely that the eastern end was occupied by the [[calefactory]], or warming house, and the western end by the [[Buttery (room)|butteries]] and kitchen.

With a length of 59m the church is one of the longest in [[Ireland]]. The visitor centre is run by the current [[Marquess of Donegall]] and has one of only two full sized hedge mazes in Ireland.\n\nThe abbey was dissolved under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The last Abbot of Dunbrody was Alexander Devereux, who became [[Bishop of Ferns]] in 1539.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1169 a contingent of Norman knights led by [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|the King of Leinster, Dermot MacMurrough]], invaded Ireland, first conquering the Irish province of Leinster then all of Ireland. In 1171 [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] led a much larger force into Ireland, taking control and making Ireland a territory of England. [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], one of the important figures in the Norman Conquest, instructed his uncle Herve de Montmorency to found a Cistercian monastery in the County Wexford.<ref name=\"Leroux-Dhuys, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois 1998. P178\">Leroux-Dhuys, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois. Cistercian Abbeys. Konemann, 1998. P178</ref> Montmorency donated the allotted land to the English Cistercian [[Buildwas Abbey|Abbey of Buildwas]]. The Abbey of Buildwas sent a lay brother to survey the land and, after an unfavorable report, Buildwas turned down the gift. The property was then offered to [[St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin|St. Mary\u2019s Cistercian Abbey]] in Dublin, which was in the filial line of Clairvaux.<ref name=\"Leroux-Dhuys, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois 1998. P178\"/> The monks of St. Mary\u2019s were delighted with their new land and they soon sent a community to the site in 1182. Due to its position near a major maritime transportation route, the abbey was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with the name Port of St. Mary\u2019s, because of the safety the abbey offered to people in trouble.\n\nThe middle of the 13th century was a boom period for the Anglo-Norman colony in Ireland and the Cistercian order shared in this prosperity. The scale and quality of the 13th century buildings constructed at Dunbrody gives a general hint of confidence and well being. The spacious early Gothic church was built sometime around 1210&ndash;1240 for the monks of Dunbrody Abbey. Dunbrody, though a relatively small abbey, was very successful until the 16th century and the rise of King Henry VIII. Following his split with the Church of Rome, Henry VIII issued the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] through a series of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541. Dunbrody was part of the first round of suppressions in Ireland and was officially dissolved in 1536. The abbey was plundered and made unfit for monks to return. The lead from the roof was melted down by using the wood from the roof. Nine years later, Sir [[Edward Echyngham#Death and legacy|Osborne Echyngham]] was given the land and the monastery which he converted into a residence. Owing to the neglect of the private owners of Dunbrody, a massive collapse occurred on Christmas Eve 1852, destroying the south wall of the church and some of the monastery. The abbey lies in ruins until this day.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Plan of Dunbrody Abbey in Wexford, Ireland.jpg|thumbnail|right|Floor plan of the abbey.]]\nThe church is in the form of a cross on plan, as is usual in Cistercian Abbeys, and has a [[nave]], [[Aisle|side aisles]], [[Transept|north and south transepts]], and [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. Apartments were formed in the roof over the chapels in the transepts (each transept has three [[chapel]]s), one over the north transept (left transept on the plan) was approached by the circular stairs and a passage across the [[triforium]] of the north transept. There is also evidence of a floor having at one time been carried over the whole of the north transept.
