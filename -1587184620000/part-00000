Iola, WI: Gun Digest. p. 264</ref><ref name=\"ROTW\">John Walter, Rifles of the World, p. 516, 2006</ref> They were one of the first rifles to use rimfire metallic cartridges.\n\nThe rifles were initially made in .22, .32, .38, and .44 rimfire.  Centerfire cartridges were added later, and some rifles were capable of firing rimfire or centerfire cartridges, by altering an adjustment on the hammer.\n\n== History of the rifle ==\n{{CSS image crop|Image=John Dwight and Co's Super-Carb.

These included the [[Sharps rifle]] (1848), the [[Smith carbine]] (1857), and others.  Those most suitable for military use were loaded through the breech, but required a separate percussion cap to ignite the cartridge.\n\nCopper [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridges which contained their own primer were introduced just prior to the American Civil War.  Only a few manufacturers came out with guns which could use this ammunition; these included the [[Henry repeating rifle]] (cartridge introduced in 1860), [[Spencer repeating rifle]], [[Maynard carbine]], Frank Wesson rifles, and Ballard rifles.  The .44 caliber Frank Wesson and Ballard rifles could use the same cartridge as each other, and these cartridges were very close in size to the .44 Henry rimfire.\n\nThe Frank Wesson rifle was the first breech-loading rifle designed for these metallic cartridges.<ref name=Artisan>American Artisan and Illustrated Journal of Popular Science, Nov 28, 1866, p. 52,53</ref>\n\nFrank Wesson (1828-1899) and N.S.

The carbine with a 24-inch barrel weighed only 6 pounds, low weight being desirable in a weapon to be carried by cavalry.  The 28 and 34 inch barrel models weighing 7 and 8 pounds respectively.<ref>D. Appleton and Company (1865). The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1864: Volume 4.

Over 2000 Wesson rifles were sold to militia in the states of Kentucky and Illinois.<ref>Walter, John.  Rifles of the World, 2006</ref> 44 caliber carbines were purchased by individuals and state governments during the Civil War.  Many of these weapons were sold through a company called Kittredge & Co, of Cincinnati, Ohio, who have their name stamped on the barrel of these weapons.\n\nIn July 1862, Brigadier-General J. T. Boyle of Kentucky complained about Gallagher guns, calling them 'worthless'.  He stated that 'They snap often, the cartridge hangs in after firing; difficult to get the exploded cartridges out often with screw-driver; men throw them away and take musket or any other arm.  They are unquestionably worthless.'  He then requested 'Sharps, Wessons, Ballards, or any other kind of carbine.'  He mentioned that Wesson carbines can be had for $25 or less from Cincinnati.<ref>Official Records, Vol. 16, p. 750</ref>\n\nThe Wesson carbine was used primarily by the Union armies, as the Confederacy did not manufacture rim fire cartridges.  However, in November 1862, the Confederacy did arrange for the smuggling of 10 Wesson rifles, and 5,000 cartridges to Texas, via Cuba.  These rifles were smuggled by Harris Hoyt, who was brought to trial in January 1865.  The rifles at that time cost $25 each, the cartridges $11 per thousand.<ref>United States.

These requirements would have been powder, bullets, patches, and percussion caps.  A soldier using a Frank Wesson or [[Henry rifle]] would have only needed to carry cartridges.\n\nFor rifles which used separate ball and powder, the ball and powder would be contained in a paper cartridge.  In wet weather, these cartridges were easily damaged.  The copper cartridges used by Henry, Wesson, Ballard and others tolerated moisture better, and were more impervious to wet conditions.\n\n== Use and sales following the American Civil War ==\nFrank Wesson rifles continued to be made until 1888.

These included the [[Sharps rifle]] (1848), the [[Smith carbine]] (1857), and others.  Those most suitable for military use were loaded through the breech, but required a separate percussion cap to ignite the cartridge.\n\nCopper [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridges which contained their own primer were introduced just prior to the American Civil War.  Only a few manufacturers came out with guns which could use this ammunition; these included the [[Henry repeating rifle]] (cartridge introduced in 1860), [[Spencer repeating rifle]], [[Maynard carbine]], Frank Wesson rifles, and Ballard rifles.  The .44 caliber Frank Wesson and Ballard rifles could use the same cartridge as each other, and these cartridges were very close in size to the .44 Henry rimfire.\n\nThe Frank Wesson rifle was the first breech-loading rifle designed for these metallic cartridges.<ref name=Artisan>American Artisan and Illustrated Journal of Popular Science, Nov 28, 1866, p. 52,53</ref>\n\nFrank Wesson (1828-1899) and N.S.

The carbine with a 24-inch barrel weighed only 6 pounds, low weight being desirable in a weapon to be carried by cavalry.  The 28 and 34 inch barrel models weighing 7 and 8 pounds respectively.<ref>D. Appleton and Company (1865). The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1864: Volume 4.

Over 2000 Wesson rifles were sold to militia in the states of Kentucky and Illinois.<ref>Walter, John.  Rifles of the World, 2006</ref> 44 caliber carbines were purchased by individuals and state governments during the Civil War.  Many of these weapons were sold through a company called Kittredge & Co, of Cincinnati, Ohio, who have their name stamped on the barrel of these weapons.\n\nIn July 1862, Brigadier-General J. T. Boyle of Kentucky complained about Gallagher guns, calling them 'worthless'.  He stated that 'They snap often, the cartridge hangs in after firing; difficult to get the exploded cartridges out often with screw-driver; men throw them away and take musket or any other arm.  They are unquestionably worthless.'  He then requested 'Sharps, Wessons, Ballards, or any other kind of carbine.'  He mentioned that Wesson carbines can be had for $25 or less from Cincinnati.<ref>Official Records, Vol. 16, p. 750</ref>\n\nThe Wesson carbine was used primarily by the Union armies, as the Confederacy did not manufacture rim fire cartridges.  However, in November 1862, the Confederacy did arrange for the smuggling of 10 Wesson rifles, and 5,000 cartridges to Texas, via Cuba.  These rifles were smuggled by Harris Hoyt, who was brought to trial in January 1865.  The rifles at that time cost $25 each, the cartridges $11 per thousand.<ref>United States.

For most of its working life it was allocated to [[Newton Abbott]] and Laira ([[Plymouth]]), working express passenger trains to and from [[Devon]] to [[London Paddington]]. Withdrawn from [[Cardiff]] in June 1962, it was sent to Swindon for breaking up.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=December 1962 |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster |page=808 |volume=103 |issue=740 |title=The Age of 'Kings' }}</ref> However, in light of the installation of a new bridge west of Bristol towards South Wales, it was coupled to its twin, [[GWR 6000 Class 6024 King Edward I|6024 ''King Edward I'']], and towed to the bridge for weight testing purposes. With both locomotives now closer to South Wales than Swindon, the decision was made to sell them to [[Woodham Brothers]] [[scrapyard]] in [[Barry, South Wales|Barry Island]].\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:6023 King Edward II train at scrapyard.jpg|thumb|''King Edward II'' at Woodhams' Scrapyard, in 1982]]\nWhilst ''King Edward I'' was saved in 1974, ''King Edward II'' remained at the scrapyard due to the rear driving wheels being flame-cut following a derailment at Woodham's. However, as part of the 150th anniversary of [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]'s formation in 1985, the hulk was acquired by [[John Harvey & Sons|Harvey's of Bristol]], and was moved to a bay platform at [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] called the Fish Dock.\n\n==Restoration==\nThe Brunel Engineering Centre Trust, under a [[Manpower Services Commission]] (MS) scheme, completely dismantled 6023 and restoration began. Work continued until the autumn of 1988, when the MS scheme funding was withdrawn and the future of 6023 was cast into doubt.\n\n6023 was then bought by the [[Great Western Society]] (GWS) and moved to [[Didcot]] in March 1990 for its restoration to continue. The restoration has included the casting of new rear driving wheels in 1994, followed by re-wheeling the chassis in 1995. The casting is notable since it is thought to be the first wheels to be created for a [[standard gauge]] locomotive in preservation. The damaged wheels were also acquired by the GWS at Didcot and can today be seen on display there.  Unlike the other preserved \"King\" class locomotives, the GWS decided to restore 6023 to its as-built single-chimney configuration.  All \"Kings\" had been converted to double chimneys under British Railways ownership, which improved performance and efficiency but changed the original appearance.\n\nOn 12 April 2010, ''King Edward II'''s boiler passed its steam test, and on 20 January 2011 it moved for the first time under its own power since 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philneale6023.fotopic.net/ |title=IIS7 |publisher=Philneale6023.fotopic.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref> It was due to re-enter service on 2 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.didcotrailwaycentre.org.uk/news/latest.html#news03 |title=News &#124; Latest News |publisher=Didcot Railway Centre |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref>\n\nInitially, ''King Edward II'' has been painted in the early BR express passenger blue livery, rather than the later standard BR Brunswick Green livery currently carried by [[GWR 6000 Class 6000 King George V|6000 ''King George V'']] and [[GWR 6000 Class 6024 King Edward I|6024 ''King Edward I'']].\n\n==Return to service==\n[[File:Mnr king 0001.ogv|thumb|''King Edward II'' hauling a train on the Mid-Norfolk Railway, in 2011]]\nThe locomotive re-entered passenger service on the [[Mid-Norfolk Railway]] on 4 June 2011, as part of a running-in programme leading to the engine's return to the main line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagerailway.co.uk/news/blue-king-on-mid-norfolk |title=Blue King on Mid-Norfolk - Heritage Railway Magazine |publisher=Heritagerailway.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802185757/http://www.heritagerailway.co.uk/news/blue-king-on-mid-norfolk |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  During the road journey to [[Dereham]], the locomotive lost its safety valve cover, with the Mid-Norfolk offering a cash reward for its safe return.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-13629650 |title=BBC News - Mid-Norfolk Railway offers reward for lost train valve |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref>  The cover was restored to the locomotive by Sunday 5 June.\n\nOn return to Didcot, it was found that a number of copper firebox and boiler stays had broken, resulting in the need for a large amount of remedial work to the boiler. On 6 September 2012, the locomotive was moved to [[Loughborough]] on the [[Great Central Railway (heritage railway)|Great Central Railway]] for firebox repairs, which were completed during early 2013.<ref>Didcot Railway Centre newsletter, October 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6023.co.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=6023.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref> The locomotive then made a series of appearances on the Great Central Railway, for both testing and running-in purposes but was later returned to Didcot where it was to be prepared to operate on the main line. In 2014, the GWS was given derogation by [[Network Rail]] to use a portable [[GSM-R]] radio unit on 6023. This unit could then also be used on other GWS locomotives yet to work on the mainline, such as [[GWR 2900 Class 2999 Lady of Legend|2999 ''Lady of Legend'']] and [[GWR 4073 Class 4079 Pendennis Castle|4079 ''Pendennis Castle'']].\n\nOwing to height restriction rules the locomotive had to be reduced in height to comply with the current Network Rail [[loading gauge]] (the max permitted height for steam engines being 13ft 1in and the original height of the kings being 4 inches over at 13ft 5in). This required the fitment of a cutdown cab and shorter safety valve cover alongside a shorter chimney. The shorter chimney however adversely affected the draughting. A new design of blastpipe with four nozzles was designed and fitted to the engine which after early indications had eliminated the draughting issues on the engine. The other preserved \"King\" class locomotives [[GWR 6000 Class 6000 King George V|6000 ''King George V'']] and [[GWR 6000 Class 6024 King Edward I|6024 ''King Edward I'']] are both fitted with double chimneys and therefore it was not possible simply to use the same proven blastpipe and chimney arrangement on 6023.\n\nOwing to the amount of time the rectification work took alongside how short the amount of time was left on the engine's current boiler ticket, it was originally decided to postpone the engine's mainline certification until after the engine's next overhaul was completed. An announcement from Didcot later on regarding the ceasing of mainline operations owing to costs and wishing to get more use of their engines, 6023 would now not be undergoing certification to run on the mainline.<ref>https://www.railadvent.co.uk/2019/12/steam-locomotive-6023-king-edward-ii-retired-from-mainline-work.html/amp 6023 retired from mainline work</ref> With mainline equipment no longer needed the engine will be re-fitted with its original cab and later on its original height safety valve cover and chimney which will also include re-fitting its original blastpipe. It is not however expected to undergo an overhaul straight away until space is available following completion of additional loco overhauls.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|GWR 6000 Class 6023 King Edward II}}\n*[http://www.6023.co.uk/ 6023 ''King Edward II'' website]\n*[http://www.didcotrailwaycentre.org.uk/locos/6023/6023.html ''King Edward II'' @ Didcot Railway Centre]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gelLvWBnG3g 70013 & 6023 working 5Z71 to Old Oak Common on 31 Oct 2017]\n{{GWR King Class}}\n\n[[Category:GWR 6000 Class|6023]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1930]]\n[[Category:Preserved Great Western Railway steam locomotives|6023]]\n[[Category:Locomotives saved from Woodham Brothers scrapyard]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain]]\n[[Category:4-6-0 locomotives]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2015}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:GWR 6000 Class 6023 ''King Edward II''}}\n{{Infobox locomotive\n| name             = ''King Edward II''\n| image            = File:6023 at Quorn on the Great Central Railway - panoramio.jpg\n| alt              = \n| caption          = GWR No.6023 ''King Edward II'' at the [[Great Central Railway]]\n| powertype        = Steam\n| designer         = [[Charles Collett|C.B.

With both locomotives now closer to South Wales than Swindon, the decision was made to sell them to [[Woodham Brothers]] [[scrapyard]] in [[Barry, South Wales|Barry Island]].\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:6023 King Edward II train at scrapyard.jpg|thumb|''King Edward II'' at Woodhams' Scrapyard, in 1982]]\nWhilst ''King Edward I'' was saved in 1974, ''King Edward II'' remained at the scrapyard due to the rear driving wheels being flame-cut following a derailment at Woodham's. However, as part of the 150th anniversary of [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]'s formation in 1985, the hulk was acquired by [[John Harvey & Sons|Harvey's of Bristol]], and was moved to a bay platform at [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] called the Fish Dock.\n\n==Restoration==\nThe Brunel Engineering Centre Trust, under a [[Manpower Services Commission]] (MS) scheme, completely dismantled 6023 and restoration began. Work continued until the autumn of 1988, when the MS scheme funding was withdrawn and the future of 6023 was cast into doubt.\n\n6023 was then bought by the [[Great Western Society]] (GWS) and moved to [[Didcot]] in March 1990 for its restoration to continue. The restoration has included the casting of new rear driving wheels in 1994, followed by re-wheeling the chassis in 1995. The casting is notable since it is thought to be the first wheels to be created for a [[standard gauge]] locomotive in preservation. The damaged wheels were also acquired by the GWS at Didcot and can today be seen on display there.  Unlike the other preserved \"King\" class locomotives, the GWS decided to restore 6023 to its as-built single-chimney configuration.  All \"Kings\" had been converted to double chimneys under British Railways ownership, which improved performance and efficiency but changed the original appearance.\n\nOn 12 April 2010, ''King Edward II'''s boiler passed its steam test, and on 20 January 2011 it moved for the first time under its own power since 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philneale6023.fotopic.net/ |title=IIS7 |publisher=Philneale6023.fotopic.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref> It was due to re-enter service on 2 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.didcotrailwaycentre.org.uk/news/latest.html#news03 |title=News &#124; Latest News |publisher=Didcot Railway Centre |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref>\n\nInitially, ''King Edward II'' has been painted in the early BR express passenger blue livery, rather than the later standard BR Brunswick Green livery currently carried by [[GWR 6000 Class 6000 King George V|6000 ''King George V'']] and [[GWR 6000 Class 6024 King Edward I|6024 ''King Edward I'']].\n\n==Return to service==\n[[File:Mnr king 0001.ogv|thumb|''King Edward II'' hauling a train on the Mid-Norfolk Railway, in 2011]]\nThe locomotive re-entered passenger service on the [[Mid-Norfolk Railway]] on 4 June 2011, as part of a running-in programme leading to the engine's return to the main line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagerailway.co.uk/news/blue-king-on-mid-norfolk |title=Blue King on Mid-Norfolk - Heritage Railway Magazine |publisher=Heritagerailway.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802185757/http://www.heritagerailway.co.uk/news/blue-king-on-mid-norfolk |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  During the road journey to [[Dereham]], the locomotive lost its safety valve cover, with the Mid-Norfolk offering a cash reward for its safe return.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-13629650 |title=BBC News - Mid-Norfolk Railway offers reward for lost train valve |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref>  The cover was restored to the locomotive by Sunday 5 June.\n\nOn return to Didcot, it was found that a number of copper firebox and boiler stays had broken, resulting in the need for a large amount of remedial work to the boiler. On 6 September 2012, the locomotive was moved to [[Loughborough]] on the [[Great Central Railway (heritage railway)|Great Central Railway]] for firebox repairs, which were completed during early 2013.<ref>Didcot Railway Centre newsletter, October 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6023.co.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=6023.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref> The locomotive then made a series of appearances on the Great Central Railway, for both testing and running-in purposes but was later returned to Didcot where it was to be prepared to operate on the main line. In 2014, the GWS was given derogation by [[Network Rail]] to use a portable [[GSM-R]] radio unit on 6023. This unit could then also be used on other GWS locomotives yet to work on the mainline, such as [[GWR 2900 Class 2999 Lady of Legend|2999 ''Lady of Legend'']] and [[GWR 4073 Class 4079 Pendennis Castle|4079 ''Pendennis Castle'']].\n\nOwing to height restriction rules the locomotive had to be reduced in height to comply with the current Network Rail [[loading gauge]] (the max permitted height for steam engines being 13ft 1in and the original height of the kings being 4 inches over at 13ft 5in). This required the fitment of a cutdown cab and shorter safety valve cover alongside a shorter chimney. The shorter chimney however adversely affected the draughting. A new design of blastpipe with four nozzles was designed and fitted to the engine which after early indications had eliminated the draughting issues on the engine. The other preserved \"King\" class locomotives [[GWR 6000 Class 6000 King George V|6000 ''King George V'']] and [[GWR 6000 Class 6024 King Edward I|6024 ''King Edward I'']] are both fitted with double chimneys and therefore it was not possible simply to use the same proven blastpipe and chimney arrangement on 6023.\n\nOwing to the amount of time the rectification work took alongside how short the amount of time was left on the engine's current boiler ticket, it was originally decided to postpone the engine's mainline certification until after the engine's next overhaul was completed. An announcement from Didcot later on regarding the ceasing of mainline operations owing to costs and wishing to get more use of their engines, 6023 would now not be undergoing certification to run on the mainline.<ref>https://www.railadvent.co.uk/2019/12/steam-locomotive-6023-king-edward-ii-retired-from-mainline-work.html/amp 6023 retired from mainline work</ref> With mainline equipment no longer needed the engine will be re-fitted with it's original cab and later on it's original height safety valve cover and chimney which will also include re-fitting its original blastpipe. It is not however expected to undergo an overhaul straight away until space is available following completion of additional loco overhauls.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|GWR 6000 Class 6023 King Edward II}}\n*[http://www.6023.co.uk/ 6023 ''King Edward II'' website]\n*[http://www.didcotrailwaycentre.org.uk/locos/6023/6023.html ''King Edward II'' @ Didcot Railway Centre]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gelLvWBnG3g 70013 & 6023 working 5Z71 to Old Oak Common on 31 Oct 2017]\n{{GWR King Class}}\n\n[[Category:GWR 6000 Class|6023]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1930]]\n[[Category:Preserved Great Western Railway steam locomotives|6023]]\n[[Category:Locomotives saved from Woodham Brothers scrapyard]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain]]\n[[Category:4-6-0 locomotives]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReturn to service:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_6000_Class_6023_King_Edward_II"}
