It is then that a supposed \"Western Hero\" appears and gives a scroll to one of the surviving ninjas, appointing him as \"The Messenger\" and telling him to deliver it to the top of a mountain. During his journey, the Messenger is aided by a mysterious blue-robed shopkeeper who provides him with upgrades and a demon named Quarble who helps to save him from death. After traveling through various areas and meeting a variety of foes turned friend, the Messenger arrives at the Tower of Time and encounters more blue-robed figures, who send him 500 years into the future to defeat the Demon King's general, Barma'thaz\u00ebl. Upon doing so, the Messenger loops around the world to the ninja village, where he, having reached the point of a cycle where he becomes the Western Hero himself, passes the scroll onto a new Messenger and takes up the role of a shopkeeper providing him with upgrades.\n\nWhen this new hero ends up dying due to the previous shopkeepers negligence, however, the blue-robes aim to break the cursed cycle, tasking the Messenger with collecting the notes of a mysterious music box in the Tower of Time. After the Messenger succeeds in this task, defeating the Demon King in the process, it is revealed that the music box is the prison of a man known as the Phantom who had become inflicted with a curse and created the time-traveling scroll in an attempt to stop it. This resulted in a 500-year-old mission passed down to several Messengers from various eras. Venturing inside the music box, the Messenger finds the Phantom, defeats the curse possessing him, and rescues him. The curse breaks loose, but the Messenger and the blue-robes team up together to destroy it, putting an end to the curse.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''The Messenger'' is a side-scrolling [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]], inspired by the classic ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'' series. Players control a ninja known as \"The Messenger\" as he goes on a quest to deliver a scroll. The Messenger initially possesses a technique called \"Cloudstepping\", which allows him to perform an extra jump in mid-air after attacking an enemy, object, or projectile. As the game progresses, the Messenger gains new abilities such as climbing walls, gliding in the air, long-range shuriken attacks, and using a grappling hook to propel himself through obstacles and enemies. By collecting Time Shards earned by defeating enemies or hitting lamps, the player can purchase additional upgrades such as health bonuses or extra attack moves. If the player dies, however, a demon named Quarble will appear and automatically claim any Time Shards the player collects as payment for a short amount of time. \n\nThe game initially presents itself as a linear level-based adventure split across two eras; the past, which is presented with [[8-bit]] graphics and audio, and the future, which uses [[16-bit]] presentation. Later on, however, the game becomes a [[Metroidvania]]-style game, in which the player revisits past eras in any order and direction in order to find key items. In this section of the game, the player can use special warps to instantly move between the past and present, instantly changing the layout of each level and allowing them to access new areas. Hidden in some areas are green medallions, earned by completing a challenging platforming section, with a bonus unlocked for collecting all 45.<ref name=\"Parish 2018\" />\n\n==Development==\nSabotage Studio is an [[indie development studio]] based in [[Quebec City]] founded by Thierry Boulanger and Martin Brouard in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/SabotageQC/|title=Sabotage Studio|website=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> ''The Messenger'' was their first finished project, releasing on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] on August 30, 2018, and [[PlayStation 4]] on March 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=The Messenger launches August 30 |url=https://gematsu.com/2018/08/the-messenger-launches-august-30 |website=Gematsu |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=The Messenger coming to PS4 on March 19 |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/03/the-messenger-coming-to-ps4-on-march-19 |website=Gematsu |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref>.<ref name=\"Parish 2018\" /> The game's score was composed by Eric W.

As he picks his daughters up from the airport, he neglects to tell them over the summer he has become engaged to Cassie McGuire.

She doesn't know how to break it to him that she finds Hawk \"more unpredictable\". She asks Jessie to pretend to be Lisa on a date with David, so Lisa can go on a date with Hawk while their father goes on a date with Cassie, Susan, and Nick (Ray Baker) his best friend. As the adults are getting ready for their double date, Susan compliments Jessie going out with David, almost exposing the ruse until Jeffrey innocently jokes he confuses the girls occasionally. At their date, Jessie is bewildered to be at a \"Welcome Home Lisa\" party with all of their friends. She embarrasses herself during a karaoke dance skit called \"The Jackson Three\" (a parody of the [[Jackson Five]]), singing the [[Janet Jackson]] song \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\". \n\nHawk is not wanting to settle down and be Lisa's boyfriend. He asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. Later that night, Jeffrey figures out the switch and grounds the girls for three weeks, with David disappointed in Lisa and Jessie. Lisa unleashes her feelings and tells Jeffrey that she doesn't like the jealous, snobbish Cassie, and neither do her sisters. The next morning, Susan speaks with Jessie and Megan, saying her earlier compliment was not an honest mistake, but that she suspected Lisa and Jessie were switching identities, and even shows them a picture of herself with her twin sister, Sharon Grand.\n\nLisa runs away with Hawk on his motorcycle only to break down at a diner. Jessie and Megan, using David's car, find her. Jeffrey, Susan, and David also do so. Hawk and David fight in the diner, causing the police to be called, and Hawk breaks up with Lisa. David begins to like Jessie better than Lisa. Cassie becomes angry that Susan went with Jeffrey to the diner. The girls begin to befriend and like Susan. They set up a date for her and Jeffrey by not telling Nick and Cassie to come. Jeffrey expresses his admiration for Susan, who refuses because he is engaged. She quits working on the Wyatts' house and continues with Nick's condo and Cassie moves the date to two days away. The girls go to Susan's apartment and meet Sharon Grand, Susan's twin sister. Sharon agrees to help them set up Jeffrey and Susan.\n\nOn the wedding day, Sharon and the girls lock Jeffrey and Susan in the garage shed, resulting in Jeffrey missing the wedding. Cassie, devastated, hooks up with Nick and drives away. David and Jessie become a couple.

However, following a rebellion by the town's governor, a renegade member of the Visconti family, Bologna was recuperated to the papacy in 1363 by Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz]] after a long negotiation involving a huge indemnity paid to [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]], Giovanni's heir, who died in 1354.<ref name=\"Partner\"/> In 1376, Bologna again revolted against Papal rule and joined Florence in the unsuccessful [[War of the Eight Saints]]. However, extreme infighting inside the Holy See after the [[Western Schism]] prevented the papacy from restoring its domination over Bologna, so it remained relatively independent for some decades as an oligarchic republic. In 1401, [[Giovanni I Bentivoglio]] took power in a coup with the support of Milan, but the Milanese, having turned his back on them and allied with Florence, marched on Bologna and had Giovanni killed the following year. In 1442, [[Annibale I Bentivoglio|Hannibal I Bentivoglio]], Giovanni's nephew, recovered Bologna from the Milanese, only to be assassinated in a conspiracy plotted by Pope [[Eugene IV]] three years later. But the [[signoria]] of the [[Bentivoglio family]] was then firmly established, and the power passed to his cousin [[Sante Bentivoglio]], who ruled until 1462, followed by [[Giovanni II Bentivoglio|Giovanni II]]. Giovanni II managed to resist the expansionist designs of [[Cesare Borgia]] for some time, but on 7 October 1506, Pope [[Julius II]] issued a bull deposing and [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Bentivoglio and placing the city under [[interdict]]. When the papal troops, along with a contingent sent by [[Louis XII of France]], marched against Bologna, Bentivoglio and his family fled. Julius II entered the city triumphantly on 10 November.\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Mappa di Bologna del Blaeu.jpg|thumb|Bologna in 1640.]]\n\nThe period of Papal rule over Bologna (1506\u20131796) has been generally evaluated by historians as one of severe decline. \nHowever, this was not evident in the 1500s, which were marked by some major developments in Bologna. In 1530, [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] in Bologna, the last of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s to be crowned by the pope.\nIn 1564, the Piazza del Nettuno and the [[Palazzo dei Banchi]] were built, along with the [[Archiginnasio]], the main building of the university. The period of Papal rule saw also the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the restoration of older ones. At this time, Bologna had ninety-six convents, more than any other Italian city. Painters working in Bologna during this period established the [[Bolognese School]] which includes [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Domenichino]], [[Guercino]] and others of European fame.<ref name=\"Raimond Van Marle 1924 pp 394-481\">Raimond Van Marle.

A series of plagues in the late 16th to early 17th century reduced the population of the city from some 72,000 in the mid-16th century to about 47,000 by 1630.  During the [[1629-31 Italian plague|Italian Plague of 1629\u201331]] alone Bologna lost up to a third of its population.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black |first1=Christopher F.|title=Early Modern Italy a Social History |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415214346|page=23|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref> In the mid-17th century, population stabilized at roughly 60,000, slowly increasing to some 70,000 by the mid-18th century. The economy of Bologna started to show signs of severe decline as the global centres of trade shifted towards the Atlantic.

Due to its Roman heritage, the central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement. The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. No more than twenty medieval defensive towers remain out of up to 180 that were built in the 12th and 13th centuries before the arrival of unified civic government.

2008\u201309|2008\u201309 season]], the club was relegated from the top-level [[Lega Basket Serie A|Lega A]] to [[LegADue]], before being relegated further to the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti

latest in [[1963\u201364 Serie A|1963\u201364]]), which make them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league; in their heyday in the 1930s Bologna FC were called ''\"Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa\"'' (Italian for \"The Team that Shakes the World\").\nThe club play at the 38,000-capacity [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], which has hosted the Italian national team in both football and [[rugby union]], as well as the [[San Marino national football team]].\nIt was also a venue at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n[[Rugby union]] is also present in the city: Rugby Bologna 1928 is

However, following a rebellion by the town's governor, a renegade member of the Visconti family, Bologna was recuperated to the papacy in 1363 by Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz]] after a long negotiation involving a huge indemnity paid to [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]], Giovanni's heir, who died in 1354.<ref name=\"Partner\"/> In 1376, Bologna again revolted against Papal rule and joined Florence in the unsuccessful [[War of the Eight Saints]]. However, extreme infighting inside the Holy See after the [[Western Schism]] prevented the papacy from restoring its domination over Bologna, so it remained relatively independent for some decades as an oligarchic republic. In 1401, [[Giovanni I Bentivoglio]] took power in a coup with the support of Milan, but the Milanese, having turned his back on them and allied with Florence, marched on Bologna and had Giovanni killed the following year. In 1442, [[Annibale I Bentivoglio|Hannibal I Bentivoglio]], Giovanni's nephew, recovered Bologna from the Milanese, only to be assassinated in a conspiracy plotted by Pope [[Eugene IV]] three years later. But the [[signoria]] of the [[Bentivoglio family]] was then firmly established, and the power passed to his cousin [[Sante Bentivoglio]], who ruled until 1462, followed by [[Giovanni II Bentivoglio|Giovanni II]]. Giovanni II managed to resist the expansionist designs of [[Cesare Borgia]] for some time, but on 7 October 1506, Pope [[Julius II]] issued a bull deposing and [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Bentivoglio and placing the city under [[interdict]]. When the papal troops, along with a contingent sent by [[Louis XII of France]], marched against Bologna, Bentivoglio and his family fled. Julius II entered the city triumphantly on 10 November.\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Mappa di Bologna del Blaeu.jpg|thumb|Bologna in 1640.]]\n\nThe period of Papal rule over Bologna (1506\u20131796) has been generally evaluated by historians as one of severe decline. \nHowever, this was not evident in the 1500s, which were marked by some major developments in Bologna. In 1530, [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] in Bologna, the last of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s to be crowned by the pope.\nIn 1564, the Piazza del Nettuno and the [[Palazzo dei Banchi]] were built, along with the [[Archiginnasio]], the main building of the university. The period of Papal rule saw also the construction of many churches and other religious establishments, and the restoration of older ones. At this time, Bologna had ninety-six convents, more than any other Italian city. Painters working in Bologna during this period established the [[Bolognese School]] which includes [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Domenichino]], [[Guercino]] and others of European fame.<ref name=\"Raimond Van Marle 1924 pp 394-481\">Raimond Van Marle.

A series of plagues in the late 16th to early 17th century reduced the population of the city from some 72,000 in the mid-16th century to about 47,000 by 1630.  During the [[1629-31 Italian plague|Italian Plague of 1629\u201331]] alone Bologna lost up to a third of its population.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black |first1=Christopher F.|title=Early Modern Italy a Social History |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415214346|page=23|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref> In the mid-17th century, population stabilized at roughly 60,000, slowly increasing to some 70,000 by the mid-18th century. The economy of Bologna started to show signs of severe decline as the global centres of trade shifted towards the Atlantic. The traditional silk industry was in a critical state.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Pullan |editor-first=Brian |title=Crisis and change in the Venetian economy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries |date=2006| publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0415377003 |page=132}}</ref> The university was losing students, who once came from all over Europe, because of the illiberal attitudes of the Church towards culture (especially after the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gross |first1=Hanns|title=Rome in the Age of Enlightenment : the Post-Tridentine Syndrome and the Ancien Regime |date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0521893787|page=238}}</ref> Bologna continued to suffer a progressive deindustrialisation also in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross |first=Hanns |title=Rome in the Age of Enlightenment : the Post-Tridentine Syndrome and the Ancien Regime|date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0521893787 |page=89}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1700s pope [[Benedict XIV]], a Bolognese, tried to reverse the decline of the city with a series of reforms intended to stimulate the economy and promote the arts. However, these reforms achieved only mixed results.

In 1790 the city had 72,000 inhabitants, ranking as the second largest in the Papal States; however this figure had remained unchanged for decades. The economy was stagnant because of Papal policies that distorted trade with heavy custom duties and sold concessions of monopolies to single manufacturers thus lowering competition, depressing productivity and incentivising corruption.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hearder|first1=Harry|title=Italy in the age of the Risorgimento : 1790 \u2013 1870|date=1994|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=978-0582491465|page=121|edition=7. impr.}}</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Bologna Piazza Maggiore c1855.jpg|thumb|Piazza del Nettuno in 1855, looking towards Piazza Maggiore.]]\n\n[[Napoleon]] entered Bologna on 19 June 1796.

Due to its Roman heritage, the central streets of Bologna, today largely pedestrianized, follow the grid pattern of the Roman settlement. The original Roman ramparts were supplanted by a high medieval system of fortifications, remains of which are still visible, and finally by a third and final set of ramparts built in the 13th century, of which numerous sections survive. No more than twenty medieval defensive towers remain out of up to 180 that were built in the 12th and 13th centuries before the arrival of unified civic government.

The first public theater was the Teatro alla Scala, active since 1547 in [[Palazzo del Podest\u00e0 (Bologna)|Palazzo del Podest\u00e0]]. An important figure of Italian Bolognese theatre was [[Alfredo Testoni]], the playwright, author of ''[[The Cardinal Lambertini]]'', which has had great theatrical success since 1905, repeated on screen by the Bolognese actor [[Gino Cervi]]. In 1998, the City of Bologna initiated the project \"Bologna dei Teatri\" (Bologna of the Theatres), an association of the major theatrical facilities in the city.

2008\u201309|2008\u201309 season]], the club was relegated from the top-level [[Lega Basket Serie A|Lega A]] to [[LegADue]], before being relegated further to the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti

headquarters in Bologna.\n\n[[Association Football|Football]] also has a strong tradition in Bologna. \nThe city's main club, [[Bologna F.C. 1909]], have won seven Italian league championships (the latest in [[1963\u201364 Serie A|1963\u201364]]), which make them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league; in their heyday in the 1930s Bologna FC were called ''\"Lo squadrone che tremare il mondo fa\"'' (Italian for \"The Team that Shakes the World\").\nThe club play at the 38,000-capacity [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], which has hosted the Italian national team in both football and [[rugby union]], as well as the [[San Marino national football team]].\nIt was also a venue at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n[[Rugby union]] is also present in the city: Rugby Bologna 1928 is
