It was released on 24 January 2011<ref name=7digital>{{cite web |url=http://www.7digital.com/artist/adele/release/21 |title=Adele&nbsp;\u2013 21&nbsp;\u2013 MP3 Downloads |publisher=[[7digital]] |accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by [[XL Recordings]] and [[Columbia Records]]. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. ''21'' shares the [[folk music|folk]] and [[Motown]] [[soul music|soul]] influences of her 2008 debut album ''[[19 (Adele album)|19]]'', but was further inspired by the American [[country music|country]] and Southern [[blues]] music to which she had been exposed during her 2008\u201309 North American tour ''[[An Evening with Adele]]''. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing ''21'' in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including [[Columbia Records]] co-president [[Rick Rubin]], [[Paul Epworth]], [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Jim Abbiss]], and [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]].\n\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, ''21'' defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label [[XL Recordings]]. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|world's best-selling album of the year]] for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is [[List of best-selling albums of the 2000s (century) in the United Kingdom|the best-selling album of the 21st century]], the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fourth best-selling album of all time]], and the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album by a solo artist of all time]], while its 23-week tenure atop the [[UK Albums Chart]] is the longest by a female solo artist.

Within a day of her break-up, she contacted producer [[Paul Epworth]], intent on capturing her emotion in a song: \"We'd had a fuming argument the night before ... I'd been bubbling. Then I went into the studio and screamed.\"<ref name=\"Times Newspaper\" /> Although she had initially planned on completing a ballad that she had begun writing with Epworth more than a year ago, the producer suggested that she aim for a more aggressive sound.<ref name=\"Calgary\" /><ref name=\"spooky\" /> Together, they restructured the song and re-wrote lyrics to reflect Adele's recent experience, deciding on the title \"[[Rolling in the Deep]].\"<ref name=\"Calgary\" /> The instrumentation evolved organically\u2014after trying out various jazz riffs, Adele attempted the first verse [[a cappella]], inspiring Epworth to improvise a melody on his acoustic guitar. A thumping drum beat was set to mimic her racing heartbeat.<ref name=\"Calgary\" /> In two days, a demo was recorded to be produced by [[Columbia Records]] co-president [[Rick Rubin]] later that year. However, Adele re-approached Epworth months later to complete production of the song.<ref name=\"Writing and R\" />\n\nBritish producer [[Fraser T Smith]] recalled following a similar trajectory when he teamed up with Adele to compose the subsequent third single \"[[Set Fire to the Rain]]\" at his MyAudiotonic Studios in London.<ref name=\"Writing and R\" /> After the two had created the demo, Adele revisited her co-writer to record the song with him, instead of the intended producer Rick Rubin. Smith thought Adele's first attempt superior to subsequent takes, and used the demo as the final production of the song, complete with live drum sounds and an elaborate strings section (arranged by British musician Rosie Danvers).<ref name=\"Writing and R\" /><ref name=\"Backing\" />\n\nWith the demos to two songs recorded, Adele approached American musician and [[OneRepublic]] frontman [[Ryan Tedder]], who was in London at the time for a radio show. Tedder had expressed interest in collaborating with the singer after they met at the [[2009 Grammy Awards]] ceremony in February.<ref name=Adkins2011locTurningTables>{{harvnb|Adkins|2011|loc=Interview: \"Turning Tables\"}}</ref> He arrived four hours early to their first studio session, buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work.<ref name=\"Writing and R\" /> Although unaware of Adele's personal predicament, he composed the opening piano sequence and first few lines to what became the lovelorn ballad \"[[Turning Tables]]\": \"Close enough to start a war/All that I have is on the floor.\"<ref name=\"Writing and R\" /> Coincidentally, it perfectly captured the experience of the singer, who arrived at the studio moments after another altercation with her former lover. Angry and unfocused, she denounced her ex-lover's tendency to \"turn the tables\" on her during their arguments, an expression that Tedder decided to reference in the song's lyrics.<ref name=\"Adkins2011locTurningTables\" /> Adele recorded the demo with Jim Abbiss the following day.\n\nAdele and Tedder arranged a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later to write and record \"[[Rumour Has It (Adele song)|Rumour Has It]].\" In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10&nbsp;minutes: \"She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note. I looked at the engineer then at her and said, 'Adele I don't know what to tell you but I have never had anyone do that in ten years'.\"<ref name=\"Writing and R\" />\n\n=== Sessions with Rubin, Wells, and Wilson ===\n[[File:RickRubinSept09.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Columbia Records co-president [[Rick Rubin]], known for his \"stripped-down\" sound and unorthodox approach in the studio, was one of the major producers for the album.]]\n\nAfter working with Smith, Tedder, and Epworth, Adele travelled to the United States for the remainder of the album's production. At the suggestion of [[Columbia Records]] group president Ashley Newton, she met with songwriter [[Greg Wells]] at his studio in Culver City, Los Angeles, where they co-wrote the gospel-tinged ballad \"One and Only.\"<ref name=\"AmSongwriter\" /> The song evolved from a four-chord piano progression in a [[Time signature|6/8-metre]], which Wells had conceived before meeting with the singer.<ref name=\"Writing and R\" /> The lyrics, aimed at the singer's new love interest, came together quickly and were later completed with [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], with whom she also composed \"[[Someone like You (Adele song)|Someone like You]].\"<ref name=\"AmSongwriter\" />\nIn 2008, Adele's appearance on the [[NBC]] sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' caught the attention of producer Rick Rubin. In the initial stage of the album's production Rubin had signed on as its sole producer, and was scheduled to produce all of its songs.<ref name=\"MTVL\" /> The demos she had recorded with Epworth, Smith, and Tedder (including \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Set Fire to the Rain\") were subsequently rerecorded by Rubin when she met with him in his Shangri-La Studio in Malibu, California, in April 2010.<ref name=\"Failing\" /><ref name=\"Calgary\" /><ref name=\"No Rubin\" />\n\nRubin, notorious for his unorthodox production style, pushed the singer beyond her comfort zone, and despite being drawn to his unconventional methods, Adele described working with the producer as daunting.<ref name=\"RRubin\" /> Rubin had attended many of her shows throughout 2008\u20132009, and after a [[Hollywood Bowl]] performance, approached her to compliment her live sound. When they met in Malibu, he attempted to \"capture her live show across on [her] record,\"<ref name=\"Calgary\" /> assembling a team of musicians\u2014including drummer Chris Dave, guitarist [[Matt Sweeney]], [[James Poyser]] on piano, and [[Pino Palladino]] on bass\u2014to contribute live instrumentation to the recording sessions.<ref name=\"Times Newspaper\" /><ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> He also decided against the use of [[Sampling (music)|music samples]] and [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]].<ref name=\"RRubin\" /> An advocate of a more free-form approach to music-making, Rubin relied on the moods and feelings behind the music itself to guide the instrumental and melodic arrangement of the songs.<ref name=\"Free Form\" /> He isolated the singer in the studio and encouraged her, as well as his team of musicians, to approach the production process with more spontaneity and less restraint.<ref name=\"RRubin\" /> The singer even recalled moving the musicians and production team to tears while recording some of the songs.<ref name=Adkins2011locLovesong>{{harvnb|Adkins|2011|loc=Interview: \"Lovesong\"}}</ref> In an interview, he commented on the nature of the recording sessions:\n\n{{quote|Her singing was so strong and heartbreaking in the studio, it was clear something very special was happening ...

It was released on 24 January 2011<ref name=7digital>{{cite web |url=http://www.7digital.com/artist/adele/release/21 |title=Adele&nbsp;\u2013 21&nbsp;\u2013 MP3 Downloads |publisher=[[7digital]] |accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by [[XL Recordings]] and [[Columbia Records]]. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. ''21'' shares the [[folk music|folk]] and [[Motown]] [[soul music|soul]] influences of her 2008 debut album ''[[19 (Adele album)|19]]'', but was further inspired by the American [[country music|country]] and Southern [[blues]] music to which she had been exposed during her 2008\u201309 North American tour ''[[An Evening with Adele]]''. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing ''21'' in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including [[Columbia Records]] co-president [[Rick Rubin]], [[Paul Epworth]], [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Jim Abbiss]], and [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]].\n\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, ''21'' defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label [[XL Recordings]]. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|world's best-selling album of the year]] for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is [[List of best-selling albums of the 2000s (century) in the United Kingdom|the best-selling album of the 21st century]], the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fourth best-selling album of all time]], and the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album by a solo artist of all time]], while its 23-week tenure atop the [[UK Albums Chart]] is the longest by a female solo artist.

In 1956, 20th Century-Fox engaged [[Robert Lippert]] to establish a subsidiary company, [[Regal Pictures]], later [[Associated Producers Incorporated]] to film [[B picture]]s in CinemaScope (but \"branded\" RegalScope). 20th Century-Fox produced new musicals using the CinemaScope process including ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' and ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (both 1956).\n\nCinemaScope brought a brief upturn in attendance, but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide.{{sfn|Watson|2015|page=290}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/poetics_10cinemascope.pdf|page=290|title='The Modern Miracle You See Without Glasses' - CinemaScope: 1953\u20131954: 'Twentieth Century-Fox presents A CinemaScope Production': 1953\u20131954 (Films made in CinemaScope from 1953 to 1956)|work=David Bordwell|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production.

By the early 1960s, 20th Century-Fox was in trouble. A new version of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) began production in 1959 with [[Joan Collins]] in the lead.<ref name=\"Kamp\"/> As a publicity gimmick, producer [[Walter Wanger]] offered $1 million to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] if she would star;<ref name=\"Kamp\"/> she accepted and costs for ''Cleopatra'' began to escalate.

However, Skouras' selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film's production did nothing to speed up production on ''Cleopatra''.\n\nMeanwhile, another remake \u2014 of the [[Cary Grant]] hit ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940) \u2014 was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep 20th Century-Fox afloat. The [[romantic comedy]] entitled ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' paired [[Marilyn Monroe]], 20th Century-Fox's most bankable star of the 1950s, with [[Dean Martin]] and director [[George Cukor]]. The troubled Monroe caused delays on a daily basis, and it quickly descended into a costly debacle. As ''Cleopatra''{{'}}s budget passed $10 million, eventually costing around $40 million, 20th Century-Fox sold its back lot (now the site of [[Century City]]) to Alcoa in 1961 to raise funds.

Elizabeth Taylor's disruptive {{POV statement|date=March 2013}} reign on the ''Cleopatra'' set continued unchallenged from 1960 into 1962, though three 20th Century-Fox executives went to [[Rome]] in June 1962 to fire her. They learned that director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors, so 20th Century-Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming. In the meantime during that summer of 1962 Fox released nearly all of its contract stars, including [[Jayne Mansfield]].{{sfn|Ferruccio|2010||page=117}}{{sfn|Strait|1992|page=86}}\n\nWith few pictures on the schedule, Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck's big-budget war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962),<ref name=\"Kamp\"/> an accurate account of the [[Normandy Landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, with a huge international cast, into release as another source of quick cash. This offended Zanuck, still 20th Century-Fox's largest shareholder, for whom ''The Longest Day'' was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for many years. After it became clear that ''Something's Got to Give'' would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead (Martin had refused to work with anyone else), Skouras finally decided that re-signing her was unavoidable. But days before filming was due to resume, [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|she was found dead]] at her Los Angeles home and the picture resumed filming as ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'', with [[Doris Day]] and [[James Garner]] in the leads. Released in 1963, the film was a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.net/move-over-darling/|title=Move Over, Darling|work=Doris Day|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> The unfinished scenes from ''Something's Got to Give'' were shelved for nearly 40 years. Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B-picture, ''The Longest Day'' was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck's supervision. It was finally released at a length of three hours, and was well received.\n\nAt the next board meeting, Zanuck spoke for eight hours, convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor.

''Fantastic Voyage'' was the last film made in [[CinemaScope]]; the studio had held on the format while [[Panavision]] lenses were being used elsewhere.\n\nZanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971, but there were several expensive flops in his last years, resulting in 20th Century-Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971. Following his removal, and after an uncertain period, new management brought 20th Century-Fox back to health. Under president [[Gordon T. Stulberg]] and production head [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], 20th Century-Fox films connected with modern audiences. Stulberg used the profits to acquire resort properties, soft-drink bottlers, [[Hoyts|Australian theaters]] and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom-or-bust cycle of picture-making.\n\nForeshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come, in late 1973 20th Century-Fox joined forces with Warner Bros. to co-produce ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardswatch.com/predictions/best-supporting-studio-warner-bros-pictures-track-record-in-the-best-supporting-actor-category/|location=United States|title=Best Supporting Studio: Warner Bros.

Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios, and announced that as 20th Century-Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies. Thus the first joint-venture studio deal was struck. In hindsight, while it may be commonplace now, back in the 1970s, it was a risky, but revolutionary, idea that paid off handsomely at both domestic and international box offices around the world.\n\n20th Century-Fox's success reached new heights by backing the most profitable film made up to that time, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film's unprecedented success: from a low of $6 in June 1976, stock prices more than quadrupled to almost $27 after ''Star Wars''' release; 1976 revenues of $195 million rose to $301 million in 1977.{{sfn|Solomon|2002|pages=19\u201320}}\n\n===Marvin Davis and Rupert Murdoch===\n[[Image:Foxplazafromolympicblvd.jpg|thumb|\n[[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]], [[Century City, California|Century City headquarters]] completed in 1987|alt=]]\nWith financial stability came new owners, when 20th Century-Fox was sold for more than $700 million in 1981 to investors [[Marc Rich]] and [[Marvin Davis]]. 20th Century-Fox's assets included [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]], the [[Aspen Skiing Company]] and a [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City]] property upon which Davis built and twice sold [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]].\n\nBy 1984, Rich had become a fugitive from justice, having fled to Switzerland after being charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with tax evasion, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

In 1956, 20th Century-Fox engaged [[Robert Lippert]] to establish a subsidiary company, [[Regal Pictures]], later [[Associated Producers Incorporated]] to film [[B picture]]s in CinemaScope (but \"branded\" RegalScope). 20th Century-Fox produced new musicals using the CinemaScope process including ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' and ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (both 1956).\n\nCinemaScope brought a brief upturn in attendance, but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide.{{sfn|Watson|2015|page=290}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/poetics_10cinemascope.pdf|page=290|title='The Modern Miracle You See Without Glasses' - CinemaScope: 1953\u20131954: 'Twentieth Century-Fox presents A CinemaScope Production': 1953\u20131954 (Films made in CinemaScope from 1953 to 1956)|work=David Bordwell|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production.

By the early 1960s, 20th Century-Fox was in trouble. A new version of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) began production in 1959 with [[Joan Collins]] in the lead.<ref name=\"Kamp\"/> As a publicity gimmick, producer [[Walter Wanger]] offered $1 million to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] if she would star;<ref name=\"Kamp\"/> she accepted and costs for ''Cleopatra'' began to escalate. [[Richard Burton]]'s on-set romance with Taylor was surrounding the media. However, Skouras' selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film's production did nothing to speed up production on ''Cleopatra''.\n\nMeanwhile, another remake \u2014 of the [[Cary Grant]] hit ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940) \u2014 was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep 20th Century-Fox afloat. The [[romantic comedy]] entitled ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' paired [[Marilyn Monroe]], 20th Century-Fox's most bankable star of the 1950s, with [[Dean Martin]] and director [[George Cukor]]. The troubled Monroe caused delays on a daily basis, and it quickly descended into a costly debacle. As ''Cleopatra''{{'}}s budget passed $10 million, eventually costing around $40 million, 20th Century-Fox sold its back lot (now the site of [[Century City]]) to Alcoa in 1961 to raise funds. After several weeks of script rewrites on the Monroe picture and very little progress, mostly due to director George Cukor's filming methods, in addition to Monroe's chronic [[sinusitis]], Monroe was fired from ''Something's Got to Give''<ref name=\"Kamp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1998/03/elizabeth-taylor-199803|title=When Liz Met Dick|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=April 29, 2016|first=David|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|last=Kamp}}</ref> and two months later she was found dead. According to 20th Century-Fox files, she was rehired within weeks for a two-picture deal totaling $1 million, $500,000 to finish ''Something's Got to Give'' (plus a bonus at completion), and another $500,000 for ''What a Way to Go''. Elizabeth Taylor's disruptive {{POV statement|date=March 2013}} reign on the ''Cleopatra'' set continued unchallenged from 1960 into 1962, though three 20th Century-Fox executives went to [[Rome]] in June 1962 to fire her. They learned that director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors, so 20th Century-Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming. In the meantime during that summer of 1962 Fox released nearly all of its contract stars, including [[Jayne Mansfield]].{{sfn|Ferruccio|2010||page=117}}{{sfn|Strait|1992|page=86}}\n\nWith few pictures on the schedule, Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck's big-budget war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962),<ref name=\"Kamp\"/> an accurate account of the [[Normandy Landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, with a huge international cast, into release as another source of quick cash. This offended Zanuck, still 20th Century-Fox's largest shareholder, for whom ''The Longest Day'' was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for many years. After it became clear that ''Something's Got to Give'' would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead (Martin had refused to work with anyone else), Skouras finally decided that re-signing her was unavoidable. But days before filming was due to resume, [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|she was found dead]] at her Los Angeles home and the picture resumed filming as ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'', with [[Doris Day]] and [[James Garner]] in the leads. Released in 1963, the film was a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.net/move-over-darling/|title=Move Over, Darling|work=Doris Day|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> The unfinished scenes from ''Something's Got to Give'' were shelved for nearly 40 years. Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B-picture, ''The Longest Day'' was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck's supervision. It was finally released at a length of three hours, and was well received.\n\nAt the next board meeting, Zanuck spoke for eight hours, convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor. Zanuck was installed as chairman, and then named his son [[Richard Zanuck]] as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3670633/The-Napoleon-of-Sunset-Boulevard.html|title=The Napoleon of Sunset Boulevard|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=January 20, 2008|last=Preston|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|first=John|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> This new management group seized ''Cleopatra'' and rushed it to completion, shut down the studio, laid off the entire staff to save money, axed the long-running [[Movietone News]]reel (the archives of which are now owned by [[Fox News]]), and made a series of cheap, popular pictures that restored 20th Century-Fox as a major studio.

''Fantastic Voyage'' was the last film made in [[CinemaScope]]; the studio had held on the format while [[Panavision]] lenses were being used elsewhere.\n\nZanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971, but there were several expensive flops in his last years, resulting in 20th Century-Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971. Following his removal, and after an uncertain period, new management brought 20th Century-Fox back to health. Under president [[Gordon T. Stulberg]] and production head [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], 20th Century-Fox films connected with modern audiences. Stulberg used the profits to acquire resort properties, soft-drink bottlers, [[Hoyts|Australian theaters]] and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom-or-bust cycle of picture-making.\n\nForeshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come, in late 1973 20th Century-Fox joined forces with Warner Bros. to co-produce ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardswatch.com/predictions/best-supporting-studio-warner-bros-pictures-track-record-in-the-best-supporting-actor-category/|location=United States|title=Best Supporting Studio: Warner Bros.

Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios, and announced that as 20th Century-Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies. Thus the first joint-venture studio deal was struck. In hindsight, while it may be commonplace now, back in the 1970s, it was a risky, but revolutionary, idea that paid off handsomely at both domestic and international box offices around the world.\n\n20th Century-Fox's success reached new heights by backing the most profitable film made up to that time, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film's unprecedented success: from a low of $6 in June 1976, stock prices more than quadrupled to almost $27 after ''Star Wars''' release; 1976 revenues of $195 million rose to $301 million in 1977.{{sfn|Solomon|2002|pages=19\u201320}}\n\n===Marvin Davis and Rupert Murdoch===\n[[Image:Foxplazafromolympicblvd.jpg|thumb|\n[[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]], [[Century City, California|Century City headquarters]] completed in 1987|alt=]]\nWith financial stability came new owners, when 20th Century-Fox was sold for more than $700 million in 1981 to investors [[Marc Rich]] and [[Marvin Davis]]. 20th Century-Fox's assets included [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]], the [[Aspen Skiing Company]] and a [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City]] property upon which Davis built and twice sold [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]].\n\nBy 1984, Rich had become a fugitive from justice, having fled to Switzerland after being charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with tax evasion, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May) German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], then attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish Guards at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} The defence of Boulogne was assisted by about eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and at dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy demolition party. During a lull in the afternoon, a ''Luftwaffe'' force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the delays in allowing an advance and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May and Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''C\u00f4te d'Opale''}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley between hills. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town (''Haute Ville'' or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]'' (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the panzers achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne, without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a ''Luftwaffe'' air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]], which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque. To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=53}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the ''Haute Ville'' (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port. Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic, until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued, until the order was questioned and Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and then visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies. Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.|Admiral Abrial{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}}}}\n\nand a reorganisation began; at {{nowrap|6:30 a.m.}} on 22 May, the first British troops arrived from England.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nIn response to General Brownrigg's requests for reinforcements, a detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Meanwhile, part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]], consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], were training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when they were ordered to embark for France. Together with the Brigade Anti-Tank Company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], they arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May, aboard three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Vimy|HMS ''Vimy'']], having been escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}. The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with General Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards held the left flank north-east of the river, on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Some road blocks had already been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft personnel held the right of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh Guards' left flank and the coast, allocated to the reinforcements which were expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and incompletely-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XXXXI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was divided into two columns, one of which was to circle round the town and attack from the north. The other column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, when it encountered the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who had arrived between the Germans and Boulogne. The small French force, including clerks, drivers and signallers, set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The same column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne that evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions in the south of the town. The Irish Guards knocked out the leading German tank and beat off subsequent attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours of the morning, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were driven back by the Guardsmen on each occasion.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} General Brownrigg, who was Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his headquarters staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer [[HMS Verity|HMS ''Verity'']], without informing the Guards. At {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} Fox-Pitt was told that the French 21st Division had fallen back from its blocking position after being attacked by tanks. Parts of the division, en route by train, were machine-gunned by German tanks and dispersed.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]]] dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking most of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and some of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and ''Vimiera'' was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} The quayside was deserted but the captain called out using a [[loud hailer]] and found that many men were in hiding and packed then into every available space. When ''Vimiera'' arrived at Dover at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} {{nowrap|1,400 men}} disembarked (including [[Arnold Ridley]]).{{sfn|Gardner|2000|pp=8\u201310}} About {{nowrap|300 Welsh}} Guards were left behind, having been wrongly informed that the evacuation had ended, who then attempted a break-out to the north-east.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the {{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division. When he discovered that disaster had befallen his division, he organised the defence of the town as best he could.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} By the time that Brigadier Fox-Pitt had received orders to evacuate, there were no means of communication with Lanquetot.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne-sur-Mer - Porte Gayolle.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A gate in the medieval town walls, defended by parties of the 21st Infantry Division}}]]\nOn the evening of 24 May, the Germans attacked the town at {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} and {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} The attacks were repulsed and some German tanks were reported to have been destroyed. The French Navy continued its fire support but the destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Chacal||2}} were damaged by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} and ''Chacal'' was later sunk by German artillery. During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\nMajor J.

On the morning of 24 May, Lanquetot discovered that the British had gone and French complaints about British \"desertion\" at Boulogne, along with the belief that the Germans at Calais would immediately move towards Dunkirk if the siege ended, may have influenced [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] to order the British garrison to fight to the finish.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=198}}{{efn|In ''Their Finest Hour'' (1949), Churchill wrote that he \"regretted the evacuation\" of Boulogne.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=70, 72}}}}\n\nIn the army volume of the British official history (1954), [[Lionel Ellis]] wrote that the five-hour delay of the XIX Corps attack on Boulogne until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, which had been ordered by General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe von Kleist}}, had been criticised in the Corps war diary. The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In the corresponding naval history volume [[Stephen Roskill]], the Navy official historian, wrote (also in 1954), that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May) German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], then attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish Guards at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} The defence of Boulogne was assisted by about eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and at dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy demolition party. During a lull in the afternoon, a ''Luftwaffe'' force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the delays in allowing an advance and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May and Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''C\u00f4te d'Opale''}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley between hills. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town (''Haute Ville'' or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]'' (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the panzers achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne, without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a ''Luftwaffe'' air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]], which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque. To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=53}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the ''Haute Ville'' (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port. Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic, until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued, until the order was questioned and Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and then visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies. Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.|Admiral Abrial{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}}}}\n\nand a reorganisation began; at {{nowrap|6:30 a.m.}} on 22 May, the first British troops arrived from England.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nIn response to General Brownrigg's requests for reinforcements, a detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Meanwhile, part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]], consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], were training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when they were ordered to embark for France. Together with the Brigade Anti-Tank Company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], they arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May, aboard three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Vimy|HMS ''Vimy'']], having been escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}. The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with General Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards held the left flank north-east of the river, on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Some road blocks had already been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft personnel held the right of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh Guards' left flank and the coast, allocated to the reinforcements which were expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and incompletely-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XXXXI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was divided into two columns, one of which was to circle round the town and attack from the north. The other column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, when it encountered the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who had arrived between the Germans and Boulogne. The small French force, including clerks, drivers and signallers, set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The same column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne that evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions in the south of the town. The Irish Guards knocked out the leading German tank and beat off subsequent attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours of the morning, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were driven back by the Guardsmen on each occasion.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} General Brownrigg, who was Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his headquarters staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer [[HMS Verity|HMS ''Verity'']], without informing the Guards. At {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} Fox-Pitt was told that the French 21st Division had fallen back from its blocking position after being attacked by tanks. Parts of the division, en route by train, were machine-gunned by German tanks and dispersed.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]]] dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking most of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and some of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and ''Vimiera'' was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} The quayside was deserted but the captain called out using a [[loud hailer]] and found that many men were in hiding and packed then into every available space. When ''Vimiera'' arrived at Dover at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} {{nowrap|1,400 men}} disembarked (including [[Arnold Ridley]]).{{sfn|Gardner|2000|pp=8\u201310}} About {{nowrap|300 Welsh}} Guards were left behind, having been wrongly informed that the evacuation had ended, who then attempted a break-out to the north-east.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the {{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division. When he discovered that disaster had befallen his division, he organised the defence of the town as best he could.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} By the time that Brigadier Fox-Pitt had received orders to evacuate, there were no means of communication with Lanquetot.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne-sur-Mer - Porte Gayolle.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A gate in the medieval town walls, defended by parties of the 21st Infantry Division}}]]\nOn the evening of 24 May, the Germans attacked the town at {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} and {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} The attacks were repulsed and some German tanks were reported to have been destroyed. The French Navy continued its fire support but the destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Chacal||2}} were damaged by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} and ''Chacal'' was later sunk by German artillery. During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\nMajor J. C. Windsor Lewis, officer commanding 4 Company, 2nd Welsh Guards, had taken charge of a large party of stragglers, who were awaiting rescue in the sheds at the quayside. Besides guardsmen from both battalions, there were {{nowrap|120 French}} infantry, {{nowrap|200 AMPC,}} {{nowrap|120 Royal}} Engineers and {{nowrap|150 civilian}} refugees; most of the Pioneers were unarmed. When the sheds came under German fire, Windsor Lewis moved the group into the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} (harbour railway station) and made [[sandbag]] barricades. On the evening of 24 May, under fire from tanks and machine-guns, they repulsed a German assault party that had approached the quay in a boat. Without food, running low on ammunition and realising that there would be no further evacuation, the force surrendered at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} on 25 May.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} The Germans captured {{nowrap|5,000 Allied}} troops in Boulogne, the majority of whom were French.{{sfn|Rickard|2008|nopp=y}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+<small>'''Approximate number of troops evacuated, 23\u201324 May 1940'''</small>{{sfn|Gardner|2000|p=10}}\n|-\n!

Communication between Fox-Pitt and the French headquarters at the Citadel had been cut off by the advance of German troops between the Citadel and the Guards positions in the lower town. When he was ordered to evacuate he could not offer to take the French, according to the orders. On the morning of 24 May, Lanquetot discovered that the British had gone and French complaints about British \"desertion\" at Boulogne, along with the belief that the Germans at Calais would immediately move towards Dunkirk if the siege ended, may have influenced [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] to order the British garrison to fight to the finish.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=198}}{{efn|In ''Their Finest Hour'' (1949), Churchill wrote that he \"regretted the evacuation\" of Boulogne.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=70, 72}}}}\n\nIn the army volume of the British official history (1954), [[Lionel Ellis]] wrote that the five-hour delay of the XIX Corps attack on Boulogne until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, which had been ordered by General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe von Kleist}}, had been criticised in the Corps war diary. The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In the corresponding naval history volume [[Stephen Roskill]], the Navy official historian, wrote (also in 1954), that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

The McHugh Gymnasium was built in front of Adelphia Hall and opened in 1983, a result of the school's first major fundraising campaign. Funds from this campaign were used to remodel the third floor of Adelphia Hall for improved science facilities. During this time the library, which then became known as Loyola Library, was moved to Peyton Hall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere were several major additions to Seattle Prep in the late 1990s. A new underground parking garage was built to replace the old parking lot, which was replaced by a grass [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]].

Also construction was completed on the Thomas Healy, S.J., Theater and Classrooms.  This was the first major renovation since the addition of St. Ignatius Hall.  The  theater, which also accommodates school Masses, features an orchestra pit with hydraulics moving it up and down for various uses, including the transportation of heavy equipment.  The workout rooms and locker rooms were also altered in this remodel.  The space below the theater is used for arts classes, a [[sacristy]] (to be used for liturgies and Masses), and weight/workout rooms. In 2008, sections of pathway around the campus plaza were redone and electronic doors were installed on several major entrances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!--ENTRIES ON THIS LIST SHOULD EITHER HAVE AN ACCOMPANYING EXISTING ARTICLE LINK WHICH VERIFIES THEY ARE AN ALUMNUS, OR RELIABLE SOURCES AS FOOTNOTES AGAINST THE NAME.-->\n* [[Bob Bellinger]], American football player\n* [[Bryce Fisher]], former NFL defensive lineman (1999\u20132008) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/brycefisher/profile?id=FIS192130 |title=Bryce Fisher |publisher=NFL.com |date=1977-12-05 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Gorman (tennis)|Tom Gorman]], former professional tennis player {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n* [[Spencer Hawes]], professional NBA basketball player, [[Milwaukee Bucks]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/spencer_hawes/ |title=Spencer Hawes Info Page |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>\n* [[Don Kardong]], Olympic marathon runner {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n* [[Amanda Knox]], convicted of murdering a fellow student in Italy, conviction later overturned<ref>{{cite book |last=Follain |first=J. |title=Death in Perugia: The Definitive Account of the Meredith Kercher Case from Her Murder to the Acquittal of Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox |publisher=St. Martin's True Crime |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-340-99309-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/deathinperugia0002foll/page/13 13\u201315] |url=https://archive.org/details/deathinperugia0002foll/page/13 }}</ref>\n* [[Joe Lombardi]], NFL offensive coordinator, [[Detroit Lions]] <ref name=aggnsptr>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-10-29/sports/8901270196_1_joe-lombardi-special-treatment-vince-lombardi |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |agency=(Seattle Times) |last=Peoples |first=John |title=Lombardi's grandson gets no special treatment |date=October 29, 1989 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref><ref name=jlbonleg>{{cite web |url=http://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/columnists/dougherty/2014/09/18/joe-lombardi-building-legacy/15868371/ |publisher=Packer News |title=Joe Lombardi building own NFL legacy |last=Dougherty |first=Pete |agency=Press-Gazette Media |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Mike McGavick]], former CEO of [[Safeco]] and former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] {{Citation needed|reason=Previous footnote was a circular reference to WP using answers.com|date=July 2010}}\n* [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]], former US Attorney for the Western District Of Washington <ref>[http://www.law.seattleu.edu/x2991.xml McKay]</ref>  \n* [[Greg Nickels]], former mayor of [[Seattle]] (2002\u20132010) <ref name=\"Greg Nickels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/about/bio.htm|title=ABOUT MAYOR GREGORY J.

As the most likely author of the ''[[Gniezno sermon]]'' created in the years 1410-1412 for bishop [[Wojciech Jastrz\u0119biec]], he writes:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=416-417}}\n{{Quote frame|One should pay attention to those who say ungodly things today in dances or elsewhere in performances, consider unclean things in their hearts, shout out and mention the names of idols, and consider whether conversion to God the Father is possible. Certainly not. For it is forbidden to hear freely these holidays, which unfortunately celebrate according to what was left of the rites of the accursed pagans of our ancestors, unless for punishment, as once the shout of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah rose. For at this festival indecent exposure and other abominations, which the Apostle says should not even be named because of God the Father. However, due to the fact that preachers have arrived, such things cease, and in many places they have already ceased [...] There is no other name under heaven in which we can be saved. For a man is not saved in the name of Lado, [[Yeshy|Jassa]], !Quia, '''Nija''', but in the name of Jesus Christ ... Not [[Lada (mythology)|Lada]], not Jassa, not '''Nija''', which are the names of idols worshiped here in Poland, as some chronicles of Poles testify ...}}\n''Statua provincialia breviter'' from 1420-1422 mentions the name of the god as Tya/Tiya:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=418}}\n{{Quote frame|Also forbid clapping and singing which calls the names of the gods Lado, Yleli, Yassa, and '''Tya''', which were used to celebrate during [[Green week]].}}\n''Sermones per circulum anni Cunradi'' from 1423 also mentions the distorted name of the deity in the form of Yaya:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=418}}\n{{Quote frame|Unfortunately, our old men, old women and girls do not pay much attention to prayers that they are worthy to receive the Holy Spirit, but unfortunately on these three days, which would have to be spent thinking, old men, women and girls come not to church, not to pray, but for dancing, not calling God, but the devil, namely Ysaya, Lado, Ylely, '''Yaya''' [...] Such ... if they do not repent, they will go from Yassa, Lado to eternal damnation.}}\n[[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] describes the cult of Nya, presents him as the Polish equivalent of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] and his temple in [[Gniezno]]:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=421}}\n{{Quote frame|They called Pluto '''Niya''', considering him the god of the underworld and the guardian and protector of souls when they leave the body. To him they prayed that the introduction would be after death to better places in the underground. For these souls [or: this god], the most important temple was built in the city of Gniezno, to which pilgrims came from all sides.}}\nAfter D\u0142ugosz, the cult of Nya is described by [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=429}}\n{{Quote frame|Pluto, also the infernal god, whom they called '''Nya''', praised the evening, and also asked him for a better and earlier place in hell and rain, or to tame the bad weather, whose church was the holiest in Gniezno, as Dlugosus testifies.}}\nAfter D\u0142ugosz, the cult of Nya is also described by [[Maciej Miechowita]].{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=426-427}}\n\n[[Jakub Parkoszowic]] writes about Nya as a god of Poles independently of sources from Jan D\u0142ugosz in his ''traktat o ortografii polskiej'' (\"treatise on Polish orthography\"):{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=420}}\n{{Quote frame|whenever it came soft \"n\" ... , they were always written with a double \"y\" in front of the appropriate vowel ... Such spelling was not enough to differentiate, because between \"'''Nija'''\", which was the name of the idol, and \"nia\", a syllable in the word 'gniazdo', there was no difference in spelling.}}\n\n=== Russian information ===\nThe Russian writer [[Mikhail Kheraskov]] in his epic poem ''Vladimir Reborn'' written in 1785 mentions Niya as one of the deities trying to distract [[Vladimir the Great]]:\n{{Quote frame|... I see fiery Nyja:<br />In him, Russia wanted to judge the hell,<br />He fiery held in his hands sinful scourge.<br />He had his own throne inside the earth<br />And surrounded by a boiling sea of evil<br />Sending terrible night ghosts.}}\nKheraskov in this poem lists the following gods: [[Perun]], [[Chernobog]], Nyja, [[Chors]], [[Simargl]], [[Kupala]], Zhnytsh, [[Uslad]], [[Lada (mythology)|\u0141ada]], [[Lel and Polel|Polel]], Posvist, [[Veles (god)|Wolos]], [[Da\u017ebog]]. This list is much longer than that given in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', which lists the following pagan gods: Perun, Hors, Da\u017ebog, [[Stribog]], Simarg\u0142, [[Mokosh]], Veles. Kheraskov probably copied the names of gods such as Niya, Lada and Polel from Polish sources.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Temple in Gniezno ===\nWhen writing about Nya, D\u0142ugosz also mentions a temple that was to be built in his honor in Gniezno. Archaeological research carried out on the [[Lech Hill]] showed the presence of a stone structure in the form of a mound on which fragments of animal bones and early-medieval ceramics were found, probably representing traces of sacrifices there.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=97\u2013100}} In addition, at the top of the hill there was a periodically wet basin, which in the theological vision of the world could emphasize the sacred (aquatic-chtonic) character of the place.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=101}} It is interpreted by the archaeologist Pawe\u0142 Szczepanik as a remnant of a cult site corresponding to the temple mentioned in the chronicle of D\u0142ugosz.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=101}}\n\n=== Interpretations ===\nAccording to [[Aleksander Gieysztor|Alexander Gieysztor]], Niya deserves trust as the equivalent of Pluto.{{sfn|Gieysztor|2006|p=197}}\n\nAccording to [[Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak|Krzysztof Witczak]], Niya is the Slavic equivalent of the Greek goddess [[Enyo]]. Both were supposed to be the remains of the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|proto-Indo-European]] goddess, \"the perpetrator, the performer of disappearance, i.e. drying, disappearing\"{{sfn|Strzelczyk|2007|p=138}} and reconstructed the name of this goddess as *''N\u016by\u0101''.{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=465}}\n\nAccording to Pawe\u0142 Szczepaniak, Niya is a female deity, caring for the dead, human fate and the community of the living.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=95}}\n\n== Przypisy ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliografia ==\n\n* {{cite book|last=Kolankiewicz|first=Leszek|title=Dziady.

In the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavs]], \"navya bone\" was used in rites related to death.{{sfn|Szyjewski|2003|p=206-207}}\n\n[[Oleg Trubachyov]] also noted the relationship between the proto-Slavic word *nav\u044c and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *''n\u0101u'' meaning \"to flow\" and pointed to the Latin word ''navis'' meaning \"boat\".{{Citation needed}} This would connect Nyja with the function of a [[psychopomp]] and in that case would be the equivalent of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Charon]].\n\n[[Aleksander Br\u00fcckner]] took the name from the word ''niti'' meaning \"to rot\", \"to molder\".{{sfn|Gieysztor|2006|p=197}}\n\n== Sources ==\nThe first source mentioning a deity named Nyja is [[Theology|theologian]] [[Lucas of Wielki Ko\u017amin]]. As the most likely author of the ''[[Gniezno sermon]]'' created in the years 1410-1412 for bishop [[Wojciech Jastrz\u0119biec]], he writes:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=416-417}}\n{{Quote frame|One should pay attention to those who say ungodly things today in dances or elsewhere in performances, consider unclean things in their hearts, shout out and mention the names of idols, and consider whether conversion to God the Father is possible. Certainly not. For it is forbidden to hear freely these holidays, which unfortunately celebrate according to what was left of the rites of the accursed pagans of our ancestors, unless for punishment, as once the shout of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah rose. For at this festival indecent exposure and other abominations, which the Apostle says should not even be named because of God the Father. However, due to the fact that preachers have arrived, such things cease, and in many places they have already ceased [...] There is no other name under heaven in which we can be saved. For a man is not saved in the name of Lado, [[Yeshy|Jassa]], !Quia, '''Nija''', but in the name of Jesus Christ ... Not [[Lada (mythology)|Lada]], not Jassa, not '''Nija''', which are the names of idols worshiped here in Poland, as some chronicles of Poles testify ...}}\n''Statua provincialia breviter'' from 1420-1422 mentions the name of the god as Tya/Tiya:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=418}}\n{{Quote frame|Also forbid clapping and singing which calls the names of the gods Lado, Yleli, Yassa, and '''Tya''', which were used to celebrate during [[Green week]].}}\n''Sermones per circulum anni Cunradi'' from 1423 also mentions the distorted name of the deity in the form of Yaya:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=418}}\n{{Quote frame|Unfortunately, our old men, old women and girls do not pay much attention to prayers that they are worthy to receive the Holy Spirit, but unfortunately on these three days, which would have to be spent thinking, old men, women and girls come not to church, not to pray, but for dancing, not calling God, but the devil, namely Ysaya, Lado, Ylely, '''Yaya''' [...] Such ... if they do not repent, they will go from Yassa, Lado to eternal damnation.}}\n[[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] describes the cult of Nya, presents him as the Polish equivalent of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] and his temple in [[Gniezno]]:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=421}}\n{{Quote frame|They called Pluto '''Niya''', considering him the god of the underworld and the guardian and protector of souls when they leave the body. To him they prayed that the introduction would be after death to better places in the underground. For these souls [or: this god], the most important temple was built in the city of Gniezno, to which pilgrims came from all sides.}}\nAfter D\u0142ugosz, the cult of Nya is described by [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]:{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=429}}\n{{Quote frame|Pluto, also the infernal god, whom they called '''Nya''', praised the evening, and also asked him for a better and earlier place in hell and rain, or to tame the bad weather, whose church was the holiest in Gniezno, as Dlugosus testifies.}}\nAfter D\u0142ugosz, the cult of Nya is also described by [[Maciej Miechowita]].{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=426-427}}\n\n[[Jakub Parkoszowic]] writes about Nya as a god of Poles independently of sources from Jan D\u0142ugosz in his ''traktat o ortografii polskiej'' (\"treatise on Polish orthography\"):{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=420}}\n{{Quote frame|whenever it came soft \"n\" ... , they were always written with a double \"y\" in front of the appropriate vowel ... Such spelling was not enough to differentiate, because between \"'''Nija'''\", which was the name of the idol, and \"nia\", a syllable in the word 'gniazdo', there was no difference in spelling.}}\n\n=== Russian information ===\nThe Russian writer [[Mikhail Kheraskov]] in his epic poem ''Vladimir Reborn'' written in 1785 mentions Niya as one of the deities trying to distract [[Vladimir the Great]]:\n{{Quote frame|... I see fiery Nyja:</br>In him, Russia wanted to judge the hell,</br>He fiery held in his hands sinful scourge.</br>He had his own throne inside the earth</br>And surrounded by a boiling sea of evil</br>Sending terrible night ghosts.}}\nKheraskov in this poem lists the following gods: [[Perun]], [[Chernobog]], Nyja, [[Chors]], [[Simargl]], [[Kupala]], Zhnytsh, [[Uslad]], [[Lada (mythology)|\u0141ada]], [[Lel and Polel|Polel]], Posvist, [[Veles (god)|Wolos]], [[Da\u017ebog]]. This list is much longer than that given in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', which lists the following pagan gods: Perun, Hors, Da\u017ebog, [[Stribog]], Simarg\u0142, [[Mokosh]], Veles. Kheraskov probably copied the names of gods such as Niya, Lada and Polel from Polish sources.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Temple in Gniezno ===\nWhen writing about Nya, D\u0142ugosz also mentions a temple that was to be built in his honor in Gniezno. Archaeological research carried out on the [[Lech Hill]] showed the presence of a stone structure in the form of a mound on which fragments of animal bones and early-medieval ceramics were found, probably representing traces of sacrifices there.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=97\u2013100}} In addition, at the top of the hill there was a periodically wet basin, which in the theological vision of the world could emphasize the sacred (aquatic-chtonic) character of the place.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=101}} It is interpreted by the archaeologist Pawe\u0142 Szczepanik as a remnant of a cult site corresponding to the temple mentioned in the chronicle of D\u0142ugosz.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=101}}\n\n=== Interpretations ===\nAccording to [[Aleksander Gieysztor|Alexander Gieysztor]], Niya deserves trust as the equivalent of Pluto.{{sfn|Gieysztor|2006|p=197}}\n\nAccording to [[Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak|Krzysztof Witczak]], Niya is the Slavic equivalent of the Greek goddess [[Enyo]]. Both were supposed to be the remains of the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|proto-Indo-European]] goddess, \"the perpetrator, the performer of disappearance, i.e. drying, disappearing\"{{sfn|Strzelczyk|2007|p=138}} and reconstructed the name of this goddess as *''N\u016by\u0101''.{{sfn|Kolankiewicz|1999|p=465}}\n\nAccording to Pawe\u0142 Szczepaniak, Niya is a female deity, caring for the dead, human fate and the community of the living.{{sfn|Szczepanik|2018|p=95}}\n\n== Przypisy ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliografia ==\n\n* {{cite book|last=Kolankiewicz|first=Leszek|title=Dziady.
