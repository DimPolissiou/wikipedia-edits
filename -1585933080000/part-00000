Here it emerges from four arched openings at the bottom of the Old Mechouar's [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] and the first major man-made division of the river take place.<ref name=\":3\" /> This division creates a number of canals (many of them hidden under streets and houses) through Fes el-Bali which eventually spill back into the Oued Bou Khareb (the name of the river's main course inside the city).<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> There are four main historic canal divisions: the ''Oued Fejjalin'', the ''Oued el-Hamiya'', the ''Sakiyyat el-Abbasa'', and the ''Oued Shrashar''.<ref name=\":02\" /> Most of these then split off into other canals as they progress through the city.\n[[File:\u062c\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644.jpg|thumb|A historic ''[[noria]]'' (waterwheel) located on the western edge of the [[Jnan Sbil Gardens]] between [[Fes Jdid|Fes el-Jdid]] and [[Fes el Bali|Fes el-Bali]].|alt=]]\nThe Oued Fejjalin is one of the most important divisions and from it the ''Oued el-Lemtiyyin'' also splits off to supply the northernmost parts of the city.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> The Oued el-Lemtiyyin passes under the [[Bab Bou Jeloud|Bou Jeloud]] area and travels under the houses of [[Tala'a Kebira]] street until it reaches the [[Bou Inania Madrasa]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Here, in the vicinity of the madrasa, the water is collected by a large distributor structure made of brick and rammed and dating from the Almoravid period. This structure has three arched openings that lead into vaulted chambers from which the water emerges on the other side into three canals at different elevations, which then spread across different parts of the northern city.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAs for the Oued el-Hamiya, it splits from the other major branches at Jnan Sbil before dividing into more branches which mostly supply the southern parts of the city.<ref name=\":3\" /> One of its branches also once supplied, via an aqueduct, the [[Andalusian Mosque|Andalus]] quarter on the opposite shore of the Bou Khareb river.<ref name=\":02\" /> (Most of the water for the Andalus quarter, however, came from a canal which originated from other streams to the south of instead of the Oued al-Jawahir; see \"Oued Masmuda\" section below.) The two last branches, Sakiyyat al-Abbasa and the Oued Shrashar, supplied the regions near [[Gates of Fez|Bab al-Hadid]] and the gardens between Fes el-Jdid and Fes el-Bali.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nMany of these canals are now underground, with only some ancient [[Toponymy|toponyms]] hinting at former bridges that passed over them (e.g. the name ''Qantrat Bou Rous'' along a part of [[Tala'a Kebira]]).<ref name=\":02\" /> These canals and streams also feed a number of industries such as the historic [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] of the city, the most famous of which are the [[Chouara Tannery|Chouara Tanneries]].<ref name=\":02\" /> A large number of [[Water wheel|waterwheels]] (known as ''[[noria]]''s or sometimes as ''saqiyya''s) were located throughout the city's water network in order to assist in water distribution or to power certain industries.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Some of these were very large, such as the huge noria which supplied the Marinid royal gardens of Mosara, measuring 26 meters in diameter and 2 meters in thickness.<ref name=\"M\u00e9talsi 2003\" /> Only a few of these waterwheels have survived in some form, including some examples around the Jnan Sbil Gardens.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Oued Bou Khareb ==\n[[File:Oued Bou Khareb.jpg|thumb|Oued Bou Khareb in 2010.|alt=]]\n''Oued Bou Khareb'' (or sometimes ''Oued el-Kbir'') is the usual name given to the main urban course of the river through the middle of Fes el-Bali.<ref name=\":02\" />{{Rp|122}} This river is initially fed by two other streams called the ''Oued ez-Zitoun'' and the ''Oued Bou Fekran'' that enter the city from the south at [[Gates of Fez|Bab Jdid]].<ref name=\":02\" />{{Rp|234}} It is also fed by the various canals that split off from the Oued al-Jawahir to supply the city before eventually ending up in this ravine in the middle of the city. As the lowest point in the medina, the river thus acts as a collector for the city's used water.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />  \n\nThe course of the Bou Khareb also forms the historical boundary between the [[University of al-Qarawiyyin|Qarawiyyin]] and [[Andalusian Mosque|Andalus]] quarters of the city, which were originally two separate cities (''al-'Aliya'' and ''Madinat Fas'') in their early history before being joined together by the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] in the 11th century.<ref name=\":02\" /> Much of the Oued Bou Khareb's course, from Bab Jdid to [[R'cif Mosque|Place R'cif]], is now hidden beneath a modern road for car traffic (one of the few that penetrates the medina). The road covers the river up to Place R'cif, a large square at the heart of the medina, and the river reemerges on the north side of square.<ref name=\"M\u00e9talsi 2003\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> From there the river runs northeast and exits the city between [[Bab Guissa]] and the former gate of Bab Sidi Bou Jida.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Oued Masmuda ===\nThe streams to the south of the city which formed the beginning of the Bou Khareb river also fed another important canal called ''Oued Masmuda''.<ref name=\":02\" /> This canal, slightly further east, supplied water for most of the Andalus quarter of Fes on the southeast side of the Bou Khareb river.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> It begins to the south of the city and passed through the old city walls through a [[culvert]] opening called ''Bab ash-Shobbak'' (\"Gate of the Window\") which was protected by an iron [[grille]].<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> A few other canals split from it as it wound its way through the city, until it finally rejoined the Bou Khareb river shortly before its exit from the city.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The canal appears to be named after the [[Masmuda]] [[Berbers|Berber]] tribal confederacy that founded the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad movement]], which suggests that it might have been constructed by the Almohads or that Masmuda families or troops were housed near it at some point.<ref name=\":02\" />{{Rp|113}}\n\n=== Historic Bridges over the Bou Khareb ===\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Br\u00fccke in F\u00e8s-Nordafrikaflug 1932-LBS MH02-13-0385.tif|thumb|The Terrafin Bridge (\"Bridge of the Cobblers\") over the river in 1932.
