A [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]], Bergman played in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], mostly for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. He was also a part of [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] in the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Minor league career===\nThe professional hockey world had its first look at Bergman in 1957 when the [[Winnipeg Warriors]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] called up the young defenceman currently on the [[Manitoba Junior Hockey League|MJHL's]] [[Winnipeg Braves]]. After two years with the Warriors, and solid defensive play, Bergman moved into the [[American Hockey League]] and continued to gain experience while skating with four different AHL squads, including the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]], [[Cleveland Barons (1937-73)|Cleveland Barons]], [[Quebec Aces]], and the [[Springfield Indians]]. It was after this last season in 1964 that the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] finally took notice. The [[Detroit Red Wings]] claimed Bergman in the 1964 Intra-League Draft on June 10 and put the hard-working defenceman to the test.\n\n===NHL career===\nBergman joined the Detroit Red Wings for the [[1964\u201365 NHL season|1964\u201365 season]] and looked very comfortable as a freshman. In 58 games, Bergman held back his offensive instincts while focusing on his defensive work. Gradually he gained confidence and seniority on the team. He played solidly when the Wings reached the 1966 [[Stanley Cup]] finals and lost to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in six games. Bergman was the man tangled up with Montreal\u2019s [[Henri Richard]] when Richard scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal against Detroit in overtime during Game 6 of the [[1965\u201366 NHL season|1965\u201366]] final series. Bergman, like all Wings from that season, was convinced Richard pushed the puck in with his glove and the goal should not have counted. He said this after the game,\n\n<blockquote>''\"I took him down and held his stick in my hand, there was no way he could score.\"'' </blockquote>\n\nBergman continued to improve his defensive and offensive roles on the team throughout the early 1970s. His well-rounded play made him useful on both the power-play and penalty-killing units for the Wings. Although he incurred his share of penalties, Bergman wasn't considered a surly opponent on the ice. He rarely looked for trouble but also never backed down from an onrushing opponent, whether he was a fancy scorer or a power forward. While all eyes were on young superstars like [[Bobby Orr]] and [[Brad Park]], the Red Wings were a mediocre team that continued to lose respect in the league, especially with the retirement of [[Gordie Howe]]. Bergman started turning to the community, becoming involved in many outside charities and organizations. He was particularly involved with helping [[disabled]] children and adults. He was one of the most liked NHLers off the ice due to his charity work and in 1973 he was named co-winner of the [[Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award]].\n\nAfter 10 years as a Wing, Bergman was traded to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] for fellow veteran blueliner [[Ted Harris (ice hockey)|Ted Harris]] on November 7, 1973. One thought as to why he was traded stemmed from Bergman speaking out when he disagreed with the decisions of coach [[Ned Harkness]]. He would post 26 points to go along with his consistent defensive play in the [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1973\u201374 season]] for the North Stars.\n\nAfter one year he was reacquired in the off-season on October 1, 1974 by the Red Wings for Detroit's third round draft pick in 1975 (who ended up being [[Alex Pirus]]). He would score 30 points for his former team before being traded again the following year. Along with [[Bill McKenzie (ice hockey)|Bill McKenzie]], Bergman was traded on August 22, 1975 for [[Peter McDuffe]] and [[Glen Burdon]] to the newly formed [[Kansas City Scouts]] where he would spend his final NHL season. In [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975\u201376]], Bergman would record his second highest point total of his NHL career, scoring five goals and tacking on 33 assists to finish with 38 total points.\n\nBergman retired with 367 [[Point (hockey)|points]] in 838 regular season games. In nearly a decade and a half of NHL service, he had the chance to play in only 21 post-season games, 12 of them taking place in [[1965\u201366 NHL season|1966]].\n\n===1972 Summit Series===\nIn 1972 Bergman received a huge compliment when [[Harry Sinden]] and [[John Ferguson, Sr.|John Ferguson]] invited him to play with [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] in the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]].  Bergman recounted the day he was asked to play for his country, <blockquote> ''\"Harry called me Sunday morning. Janie and the kids and I were just going out the door to church, and I had to stop. Janie was saying, 'Would you get off the damn phone, we have to get to church.' It was Harry Sinden on the phone asking me if I'd be part of the team.\"'' </blockquote> Bergman played an important defensive role in all eight games against the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and chipped in with three assists. He would posthumously be honored for his defensive efforts in 2005, when the team was honored, en masse, as members of the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n*Turnbull Cup ([[MJHL]]) championship (1959)\n*[[Memorial Cup]] championship ([[1959 Memorial Cup|1959]])\n*Selected to [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] for [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]]\n*Played in [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] ([[1973 NHL All-Star Game|1973]])\n*\"Honoured Member\" of the [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]]\n*\"Honoured Member\" of the [[Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame]]\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[regular season|Regular&nbsp;season]]\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

A [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]], Bergman played in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], mostly for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. He was also a part of [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] in the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Minor league career===\nThe professional hockey world had its first look at Bergman in 1957 when the [[Winnipeg Warriors]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] called up the young defenceman currently on the [[Manitoba Junior Hockey League|MJHL's]] [[Winnipeg Braves]]. After two years with the Warriors, and solid defensive play, Bergman moved into the [[American Hockey League]] and continued to gain experience while skating with four different AHL squads, including the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]], [[Cleveland Barons (1937-73)|Cleveland Barons]], [[Quebec Aces]], and the [[Springfield Indians]]. It was after this last season in 1964 that the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] finally took notice. The [[Detroit Red Wings]] claimed Bergman in the 1964 Intra-League Draft on June 10 and put the hard-working defenceman to the test.\n\n===NHL career===\nBergman joined the Detroit Red Wings for the [[1964\u201365 NHL season|1964\u201365 season]] and looked very comfortable as a freshman. In 58 games, Bergman held back his offensive instincts while focusing on his defensive work. Gradually he gained confidence and seniority on the team. He played solidly when the Wings reached the 1966 [[Stanley Cup]] finals and lost to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in six games. Bergman was the man tangled up with Montreal\u2019s [[Henri Richard]] when Richard scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal against Detroit in overtime during Game 6 of the [[1965\u201366 NHL season|1965\u201366]] final series. Bergman, like all Wings from that season, was convinced Richard pushed the puck in with his glove and the goal should not have counted. He said this after the game,\n\n<blockquote>''\"I took him down and held his stick in my hand, there was no way he could score.\"'' </blockquote>\n\nBergman continued to improve his defensive and offensive roles on the team throughout the early 1970s. His well-rounded play made him useful on both the power-play and penalty-killing units for the Wings. Although he incurred his share of penalties, Bergman wasn't considered a surly opponent on the ice. He rarely looked for trouble but also never backed down from an onrushing opponent, whether he was a fancy scorer or a power forward. While all eyes were on young superstars like [[Bobby Orr]] and [[Brad Park]], the Red Wings were a mediocre team that continued to lose respect in the league, especially with the retirement of [[Gordie Howe]]. Bergman started turning to the community, becoming involved in many outside charities and organizations. He was particularly involved with helping [[disabled]] children and adults. He was one of the most liked NHLers off the ice due to his charity work and in 1973 he was named co-winner of the [[Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award]].\n\nAfter 10 years as a Wing, Bergman was traded to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] for fellow veteran blueliner [[Ted Harris (ice hockey)|Ted Harris]] on November 7, 1973. One thought as to why he was traded stemmed from Bergman speaking out when he disagreed with the decisions of coach [[Ned Harkness]]. He would post 26 points to go along with his consistent defensive play in the [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1973\u201374 season]] for the North Stars.\n\nAfter one year he was reacquired in the off-season on October 1, 1974 by the Red Wings for Detroit's third round draft pick in 1975 (who ended up being [[Alex Pirus]]). He would score 30 points for his former team before being traded again the following year. Along with [[Bill McKenzie (ice hockey)|Bill McKenzie]], Bergman was traded on August 22, 1975 for [[Peter McDuffe]] and [[Glen Burdon]] to the newly formed [[Kansas City Scouts]] where he would spend his final NHL season. In [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975\u201376]], Bergman would record his second highest point total of his NHL career, scoring five goals and tacking on 33 assists to finish with 38 total points.\n\nBergman retired with 367 [[Point (hockey)|points]] in 838 regular season games. In nearly a decade and a half of NHL service, he had the chance to play in only 21 post-season games, 12 of them taking place in [[1965\u201366 NHL season|1966]].\n\n===1972 Summit Series===\nIn 1972 Bergman received a huge compliment when [[Harry Sinden]] and [[John Ferguson, Sr.|John Ferguson]] invited him to play with [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] in the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]].  Bergman recounted the day he was asked to play for his country, <blockquote> ''\"Harry called me Sunday morning. Janie and the kids and I were just going out the door to church, and I had to stop. Janie was saying, 'Would you get off the damn phone, we have to get to church.' It was Harry Sinden on the phone asking me if I'd be part of the team.\"'' </blockquote> Bergman played an important defensive role in all eight games against the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and chipped in with three assists.

Maria goes to the hacienda, a fine, decaying old house in a tropical jungle at the edge of the sea, to prepare the place for sale; while visiting the house, Maria starts wandering through the halls and rooms and she begin to remember her visit years before. While going through her aunt's papers, she also start to find some clues to her aunt's behaviour. Maria is haunted by flashbacks to her childhood, when she spent several months at the hacienda in the company of only the beautiful and mysterious Oriana and Fidelia, a quarrelsome old retainer who constantly hints at terrible events that are best forgotten. In flashbacks, the film show the young Maria trying to understand the quiet but strange atmosphere that surrounds the place while sorting out why Oriana never leaves the hacienda and what secret may be in Oriana's past.\nThe young Maria, as she learns things, imagines her aunt's youth, cruel father, and first love. After these reveries within reveries, Maria, now a grown woman, eventually makes one more discovery by connecting some issues, finding evidence that someone never seen may also be living in the vicinity.

Maria goes to the hacienda, a fine, decaying old house in a tropical jungle at the edge of the sea, to prepare the place for sale; while visiting the house, Maria starts wandering through the halls and rooms and she begin to remember her visit years before. While going through her aunt's papers, she also start to find some clues to her aunt's behaviour. Maria is haunted by flashbacks to her childhood, when she spent several months at the hacienda in the company of only the beautiful and mysterious Oriana and Fidelia, a quarrelsome old retainer who constantly hints at terrible events that are best forgotten. In flashbacks, the film show the young Maria trying to understand the quiet but strange atmosphere that surrounds the place while sorting out why Oriana never leaves the hacienda and what secret may be in Oriana's past.\nThe young Maria, as she learns things, imagines her aunt's youth, cruel father, and first love. After these reveries within reveries, Maria, now a grown woman, eventually makes one more discovery by connecting some issues, finding evidence that someone never seen may also be living in the vicinity.

In the 16th century, Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[royal house|royal dynasties]] in history. As an archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Early in the 19th century, Austria established [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]] but pursued its own course independently of the other German states. Following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|compromise]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was established.\n\nAustria was involved in [[World War I]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] following the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne. After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy, the [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed with the intent of the union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], which eventually failed because of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the state remained unrecognized. In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] became the legal successor of [[Cisleithania|Austria]]. In 1938, the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], who became the [[German Chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[German Reich]], achieved the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by the [[Anschluss]]. Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945 and an extended period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as a sovereign and self-governing democratic nation known as the Second Republic.\n\nAustria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a directly elected Federal [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of the federal government. Major [[List of cities and towns in Austria|urban areas of Austria]] include [[Graz]], [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]]. Austria is consistently ranked in the top 20 [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest countries in the world]] by GDP per capita terms.

Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Austrian\u2013Prussian dualism]] began in Germany.

The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria.

As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866.

Austria became a [[Federation|federal]], [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its [[States of Austria|nine states]] is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 17, 142</ref>\n\nThe [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] (''Bundespr\u00e4sident''), who is directly elected by popular majority vote, with a run-off between the top-scoring candidates, if necessary. The head of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]] (''Bundeskanzler''), who is selected by the President and tasked with forming a government based on the partisan composition of the lower house of parliament.\n\nThe government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]. Voting for the Federal President and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103221527/http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archivedate=3 November 2007|title=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Inneres \u2013 Elections Compulsory voting|publisher=Bmi.gv.at|accessdate=3 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nAustria's parliament consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over the age of 16 has the [[Suffrage|right to vote]]. The voting age was lowered from 18 in 2007.\n\nWhile there is a general threshold of 4% of the vote for all parties in federal elections (Nationalratswahlen) to participate in the proportional allocation of seats, there remains the possibility of being elected to a seat directly in one of the 43 regional electoral districts ({{lang|de|Direktmandat}}).\n\nThe Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the legislative process in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]], has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can\u2014in almost all cases\u2014ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as ''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. \"vote of persistence\").

The Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') exerts considerable influence on the political system because of its power to invalidate legislation and ordinances that are not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the [[European Court of Justice]] may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union.

In January 2007 the People's Party and SP\u00d6 formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\nElections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FP\u00d6 and the deceased [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.\n\nIn the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.\n\nAfter the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for [[2017 Austrian legislative election|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) with its new young leader [[Sebastian Kurz]] emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The \u00d6VP decided to form a coalition with the FP\u00d6. The new government between the centre-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017, but the coalition government later collapsed and [[2019 Austrian legislative election|new elections]] were called for 29 September 2019. The elections lead to another landslide victory (37.5%) of the  Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) who formed a coalition-government with the reinvigorated (13.9%) Greens, which was sworn in with Kurz as chancellor on January 7 2020.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]\n\nThe 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality\". The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory\". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\nAustria began to reassess its definition of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] (although it was careful to do so only after Russia joined) and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is to not allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Austria signed the UN's [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=2019-07-06 }}</ref> which was opposed by all NATO members.<ref>{{cite news |title=122 countries adopt 'historic' UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-treaty-ban-nuclear-weapons-1.4192761 |work=CBC News |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAustria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE).

Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155729/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.\n\nWithin its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].\n\n===Administrative divisions=== <!---\"Administrative divisions of Austria\" redirects here--->\n{{main|States of Austria}}\nAustria is a [[federal republic]] consisting of [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}).<ref name=\"CIA\" /> The states are sub-divided into [[Districts of Austria|districts]] ({{lang|de|[[Bezirke]]}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|[[Statutarstadt|Statutarst\u00e4dte]]}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|Gemeinden}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a state.\n\nAustria's constituent states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social welfare, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been questioned whether a small country should maintain ten subnational legislatures.{{citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=[need source if this claim is legit]}} Consolidation of local governments has already been undertaken at the ''Gemeinde'' level for purposes of administrative efficiency and cost savings (''[[:de:Gemeindefusion|Gemeindezusammenlegung]]).''\n\n{{Austrian Federal States|options=float:left; font-size:100%; border:3px; max-width:480px; width:50%}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%\"\n|- style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right\"\n!

The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.\n\nAustria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46\u00b0]] and [[49th parallel north|49\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9\u00b0]] and [[18th meridian east|18\u00b0 E]].\n\nIt can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] makes up the remaining 4%.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the [[Central European mixed forests]], Pannonian mixed forests, Alps conifer and mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests.\n<gallery heights=\"120px\" widths=\"160px\">\nFile:1 hallstatt austria.jpg|View of [[Hallstatt]]\nFile:Krems and mautern from ferdinandswarte.jpg|View of [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]] at the end of [[Wachau|Wachau valley]]\nFile:Vorderhopfreben \u00dcntschenspitze 1.jpg|Austrian rural area of [[Schoppernau]] in summer\nFile:Donau Linz Abend.jpg|The [[Danube]] at [[Linz]] with cruise ships\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map AUT present.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification]] map for Austria<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Hylke E. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Niklaus E. |last3=McVicar |first3=Tim R. |last4=Vergopolan |first4=Noemi |last5=Berg |first5=Alexis |last6=Wood |first6=Eric F. |title=Present and future K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution |journal=Scientific Data |date=30 October 2018 |volume=5 |pages=180214 |doi=10.1038/sdata.2018.214|pmid=30375988 |pmc=6207062 |bibcode=2018NatSD...580214B }}</ref>]]\n\nThe greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]], where humid westerly winds predominate.

It is important to note though that Austria may experience very cold, severe winters, but most of the time they are only around as cold as those in somewhat comparable climate zones, for example Southern Scandinavia or Eastern Europe. As well, at higher altitudes, summers are usually considerably cooler than in the valleys/lower altitudes.

Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[J\u00f6rg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K\u00e4rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is the so-called \"[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]\" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the \"loyal Windische\" and the \"national Slovenes\", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Austria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Austria (2017)<ref name=\"wienerzeitung\">WZ-Recherche 2016.

School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.\n\nPrimary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].\n\nStandard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.\n\nAs in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.\n\n[[File:Wien - Universit\u00e4t (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]\nAs at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report (\"Zeugnis\") are a prerequisite for moving up (\"aufsteigen\") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year (\"sitzenbleiben\").\n\nIt is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as \"Gymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or \"Realgymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.\n\nThe Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee (\"''Studienbeitrag''\") of \u20ac363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).<ref name=\"Tuition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501221940/http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|archive-date=1 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around \u20ac363.36 per term is charged.

Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\nVienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vienna State Opera]]]]\n\nVienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the [[Sei gesegnet ohne Ende|traditional Austrian anthem]] by Joseph Haydn.\n\nAustrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712135148/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|archive-date=12 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nInternational pop super star Johann H\u00f6lzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.\n\n[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n[[File:Botanischer Garten Der Universit\u00e4t, Wenen, Oostenrijk Aug 02, 2019 04-27-11 PM.jpeg|thumb|The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere Palace]], an example of [[Baroque]] architecture]]\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Architecture of Austria\"; if the section heading changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Further|List of Austrian artists and architects}}\n\nAmong Austrian Artists and architects one can find the painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Hans Makart]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Carl Moll]], and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], the photographers [[Inge Morath]] and [[Ernst Haas]], and architects like [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], [[Otto Wagner]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Hans Hollein]] (recipient of the 1985 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]).

In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].\n\nIn addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.\n\nA focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].\n\nThe [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9s include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}\n[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Stefan Zweig]]]]\nComplementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].\n\nFamous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].\n\n===Food and beverages===\n{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}\n\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofk\u00fcche\") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"[[Apfelstrudel]]\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"[[Millirahmstrudel]]\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\nIn addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Polish cuisine|Polish]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Balkan]] and [[French cuisine|French]] cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]], a traditional Austrian dish]]\n\nTypical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Kn\u00f6del]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also K\u00e4rntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613115037/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBeer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Kr\u00fcgerl'' or ''gro\u00dfes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures. At festivals one litre ''Ma\u00df'' and two litre ''Doppelma\u00df'' in the [[Bavaria]]n style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are [[lager]] (known as ''M\u00e4rzen'' in Austria), naturally cloudy ''Zwicklbier'' and [[wheat beer]]. At holidays like Christmas and Easter [[bock]] beer is also available.\n\nThe most important wine-producing areas are in [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]], [[Styria]] and Vienna.

The produce of small private schnapps [[distillery|distilleries]], of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as ''Selbstgebrannter'' or ''Hausbrand''.\n\nLocal soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages. Another popular drink is the so-called \"Spezi\", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Red Bull]], the highest-selling energy drink in the world, was introduced by [[Dietrich Mateschitz]], an Austrian entrepreneur.\n\n===Sports===\n{{main|Sport in Austria}}\n[[File:Bergisel.jpg|thumb|[[Innsbruck]] hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]], as well as the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics]], the first in history.]]\n\nDue to the mountainous terrain, [[alpine skiing]] is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horak|first=Roman|last2=Spitaler|first2=Georg|year=2003|title=Sport, Space and National Identity: Soccer and Skiing as Formative Forces: On the Austrian Example|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=46|issue=11|pages=1508\u201318|doi=10.1177/0002764203046011004}}</ref> Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular.

However, recently Austrian football has not been internationally successful. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].\n\nBesides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[\u00d6sterreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[\u00d6sterreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].\n\n[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]].

In the 16th century, Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[royal house|royal dynasties]] in history. As an archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Early in the 19th century, Austria established [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]] but pursued its own course independently of the other German states. Following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|compromise]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was established.\n\nAustria was involved in [[World War I]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] following the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne. After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy, the [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed with the intent of the union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], which eventually failed because of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the state remained unrecognized. In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] became the legal successor of [[Cisleithania|Austria]]. In 1938, the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], who became the [[German Chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[German Reich]], achieved the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by the [[Anschluss]]. Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945 and an extended period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as a sovereign and self-governing democratic nation known as the Second Republic.\n\nAustria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a directly elected Federal [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of the federal government. Major [[List of cities and towns in Austria|urban areas of Austria]] include [[Graz]], [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]]. Austria is consistently ranked in the top 20 [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest countries in the world]] by GDP per capita terms.

In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.\n\nThe Habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands.

Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Austrian\u2013Prussian dualism]] began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Congress of Vienna.PNG|thumb|left|The [[Congress of Vienna]] met in 1814\u201315.

The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the German lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolutions]] aiming to create a unified Germany.<ref name=\"johnson 36\">Johnson 36</ref>\n\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|Map of the [[German Confederation]] (1815-1836) with its 39 member states]]\n\nThe various different possibilities for a united Germany were: a [[Kleindeutschland and Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Greater Germany]], or a [[United States of Greater Austria|Greater Austria]] or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866.

Yet, the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: for example, the ''Reichsgesetzblatt'', publishing the laws and ordinances of [[Cisleithania]], was issued in eight languages; and all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices.\n\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\n\nMany Austrians of all different social circles such as [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]] promoted strong [[German nationalism in Austria|pan-Germanism]] in hope of reinforcing an ethnic German identity and the annexation of Austria to Germany.<ref name=\"DPSO\">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in \u00d6sterreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423112116/http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | archive-date=23 April 2014 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some Austrians such as [[Karl Lueger]] also used pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political goals.

Austria also implements the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], since the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is part of the Austrian constitution.\n\n===Since 2006===\n[[File:Wien - Bundeskanzleramt1.JPG|thumb|The Federal Chancellery on Ballhausplatz]]\nAfter general elections held in October 2006, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6) emerged as the strongest party, and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling.<ref name=\"Election2002\">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|title=24 November 2002 General Election Results \u2013 Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707185433/http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|archive-date=7 July 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Election2006\">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|title=October&nbsp;1st,&nbsp;2006 General Election Results \u2013 Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707185102/http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|archive-date=7 July 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and SP\u00d6 formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\nElections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FP\u00d6 and the deceased [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.\n\nIn the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.\n\nAfter the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for [[2017 Austrian legislative election|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) with its new young leader [[Sebastian Kurz]] emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The \u00d6VP decided to form a coalition with the FP\u00d6. The new government between the centre-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017, but the coalition government later collapsed and [[2019 Austrian legislative election|new elections]] were called for 29 September 2019. The elections lead to another landslide victory (37.5%) of the  Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) who formed a coalition-government with the reinvigorated (13.9%) Greens, which was sworn in with Kurz as chancellor on January 7 2020.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]\n\nThe 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality\". The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory\". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\nAustria began to reassess its definition of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] (although it was careful to do so only after Russia joined) and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is to not allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Austria signed the UN's [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=2019-07-06 }}</ref> which was opposed by all NATO members.<ref>{{cite news |title=122 countries adopt 'historic' UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-treaty-ban-nuclear-weapons-1.4192761 |work=CBC News |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAustria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). As an OSCE-participating State, Austria's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]].\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Austrian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesheer}}) mainly relies on [[conscription]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory [[military service]], followed by an eight-year reserve obligation.

Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.\n\nThe main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkr\u00e4ftef\u00fchrungskommando, SKF\u00fcKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkr\u00e4fte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte), International Missions (Internationale Eins\u00e4tze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkr\u00e4fte), next to Joint Mission Support Command (Kommando Einsatzunterst\u00fctzung; KdoEU) and Joint Command Support Centre (F\u00fchrungsunterst\u00fctzungszentrum; F\u00fcUZ).

As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. Command of the Austrian Armed Forces is exercised by the Minister of Defence, {{as of|2018|March|lc=yes}}: [[Mario Kunasek]].\n\nSince the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded \"[[Iron Curtain]]\" separating Austria and its [[Eastern Bloc]] neighbours ([[Hungary]] and former [[Czechoslovakia]]), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and [[Slovakia]] joined the EU [[Schengen Area]] in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing \"internal\" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155729/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.\n\nWithin its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].\n\n===Administrative divisions=== <!---\"Administrative divisions of Austria\" redirects here--->\n{{main|States of Austria}}\nAustria is a [[federal republic]] consisting of [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}).<ref name=\"CIA\" /> The states are sub-divided into [[Districts of Austria|districts]] ({{lang|de|[[Bezirke]]}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|[[Statutarstadt|Statutarst\u00e4dte]]}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|Gemeinden}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a state.\n\nAustria's constituent states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social welfare, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been questioned whether a small country should maintain ten subnational legislatures.{{citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=[need source if this claim is legit]}} Consolidation of local governments has already been undertaken at the ''Gemeinde'' level for purposes of administrative efficiency and cost savings (''[[:de:Gemeindefusion|Gemeindezusammenlegung]]).''\n\n{{Austrian Federal States|options=float:left; font-size:100%; border:3px; max-width:480px; width:50%}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%\"\n|- style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right\"\n!

The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.\n\nAustria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46\u00b0]] and [[49th parallel north|49\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9\u00b0]] and [[18th meridian east|18\u00b0 E]].\n\nIt can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] makes up the remaining 4%.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]].

The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.<ref name=\"ZAMG\"/><ref>{{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|title= Climate-Data.org|access-date= 15 April 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170415201756/https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|archive-date= 15 April 2017|url-status=live|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title= Atlantic influence on the Alps|journal= Environmental Research Letters|volume= 8|issue= 3|pages= 034026|doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|year= 2013|last1= Zampieri|first1= Matteo|last2= Scoccimarro|first2= Enrico|last3= Gualdi|first3= Silvio|doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed=collapsed\n|location = Lech, Vorarlberg (1440 m; average temperatures 1982 \u2013 2012) Dfc, bordering on Dfb.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n<!--Average high temperatures-->\n|Jan high C = -0.7\n|Feb high C = 0.3\n|Mar high C = 3.5\n|Apr high C = 7.1\n|May high C = 11.8\n|Jun high C = 17.4\n|Jul high C = 16.8\n|Aug high C = 14.3\n|Sep high C = 15.1\n|Oct high C = 9.7\n|Nov high C = 3.7\n|Dec high C = 0.1\n|Average high C =\n|Jan mean C = -4.5\n|Feb mean C = -3.7\n|Mar mean C = -0.6\n|Apr mean C = 2.9\n|May mean C = 7.3\n|Jun mean C = 10.6\n|Jul mean C = 12.7\n|Aug mean C = 12.2\n|Sep mean C = 9.9\n|Oct mean C = 5.6\n|Nov mean C = 0.4\n|Dec mean C = -3.3\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = -8.2\n|Feb low C = -7.6\n|Mar low C = -4.7\n|Apr low C = -1.3\n|May low C = 2.8\n|Jun low C = 6.0\n|Jul low C = 8.0\n|Aug low C = 7.7\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = 1.6\n|Nov low C = -2.9\n|Dec low C = -6.6\n|Average low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59\n|Feb precipitation mm = 54\n|Mar precipitation mm = 56\n|Apr precipitation mm = 70\n|May precipitation mm = 103\n|Jun precipitation mm = 113\n|Jul precipitation mm = 133\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136\n|Sep precipitation mm = 95\n|Oct precipitation mm = 67\n|Nov precipitation mm = 78\n|Dec precipitation mm = 66\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1= <ref name=ZAMG />\n|source 2= {{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/location/117363/|title= Lech climate data}}\n}}\n{{Weather box\n|collapsed=collapsed\n|location = K\u00fchtai, Tyrol(2060 m; average temperatures 1982 \u2013 2012) ET, somewhat close to Dfc.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n<!--Average high temperatures-->\n|Jan high C = -3.3\n|Feb high C = -3.2\n|Mar high C = -0.9\n|Apr high C = 2.3\n|May high C = 7.0\n|Jun high C = 10.4\n|Jul high C = 12.7\n|Aug high C = 12.3\n|Sep high C = 9.6\n|Oct high C = 6.3\n|Nov high C = 0.5\n|Dec high C = -2.4\n|Average high C =\n|Jan mean C = -6.6\n|Feb mean C = -6.5\n|Mar mean C = -4.2\n|Apr mean C = -1.1\n|May mean C = 3.4\n|Jun mean C = 6.6\n|Jul mean C = 8.8\n|Aug mean C = 8.6\n|Sep mean C = 6.4\n|Oct mean C = 2.9\n|Nov mean C = -2.4\n|Dec mean C = -5.4\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = -9.9\n|Feb low C = -9.8\n|Mar low C = -7.5\n|Apr low C = -4.4\n|May low C = -0.2\n|Jun low C = 2.9\n|Jul low C = 4.9\n|Aug low C = 4.9\n|Sep low C = 3.3\n|Oct low C = -0.5\n|Nov low C = -5.2\n|Dec low C = -8.4\n|Average low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 73\n|Feb precipitation mm = 66\n|Mar precipitation mm = 80\n|Apr precipitation mm = 87\n|May precipitation mm = 115\n|Jun precipitation mm = 126\n|Jul precipitation mm = 148\n|Aug precipitation mm = 138\n|Sep precipitation mm = 96\n|Oct precipitation mm = 74\n|Nov precipitation mm = 83\n|Dec precipitation mm = 72\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1= <ref name=ZAMG />\n|source 2= {{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/location/111749/|title= K\u00fchtai climate data}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Austria}}\n[[File:13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg|thumb|[[Vienna International Centre]] with the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and the [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]]]]\n\nAustria consistently ranks high in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]],<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=122&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=14|title=Austria|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=17 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125152140/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=122&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=14|archive-date=25 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> due to its highly industrialized economy, and well-developed [[social market economy]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly influential, exercising large influence on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the [[economy of Austria]].\n\nGermany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. Since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]], it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany.

Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[J\u00f6rg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K\u00e4rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is the so-called \"[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]\" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the \"loyal Windische\" and the \"national Slovenes\", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Austria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Austria (2017)<ref name=\"wienerzeitung\">WZ-Recherche 2016.

School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.\n\nPrimary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].\n\nStandard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.\n\nAs in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.\n\n[[File:Wien - Universit\u00e4t (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]\nAs at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report (\"Zeugnis\") are a prerequisite for moving up (\"aufsteigen\") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year (\"sitzenbleiben\").\n\nIt is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as \"Gymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or \"Realgymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.\n\nThe Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee (\"''Studienbeitrag''\") of \u20ac363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).<ref name=\"Tuition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501221940/http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|archive-date=1 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around \u20ac363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about \u20ac5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of \u20ac20.20 is charged for the student union and insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oeh.ac.at/service/oeh-beitrag|website=www.oeh.ac.at|title=H\u00d6HE DES \u00d6H-BEITRAGES?|lang=de|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Austria}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Austria}}\n[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u20131791)]]\n\nAustria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\nVienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vienna State Opera]]]]\n\nVienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the [[Sei gesegnet ohne Ende|traditional Austrian anthem]] by Joseph Haydn.\n\nAustrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712135148/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|archive-date=12 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nInternational pop super star Johann H\u00f6lzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.\n\n[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n[[File:Botanischer Garten Der Universit\u00e4t, Wenen, Oostenrijk Aug 02, 2019 04-27-11 PM.jpeg|thumb|The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere Palace]], an example of [[Baroque]] architecture]]\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Architecture of Austria\"; if the section heading changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Further|List of Austrian artists and architects}}\n\nAmong Austrian Artists and architects one can find the painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Hans Makart]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Carl Moll]], and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], the photographers [[Inge Morath]] and [[Ernst Haas]], and architects like [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], [[Otto Wagner]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Hans Hollein]] (recipient of the 1985 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]). Contemporary artist Herbert Brandl.\n\n===Cinema and theatre===\n[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] is a well-known Austrian and American actor]]\n[[Sascha Kolowrat]] was an Austrian pioneer of filmmaking. [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], and [[Fred Zinnemann]] originally came from the Austrian Empire before establishing themselves as internationally relevant filmmakers. [[Willi Forst]], [[Ernst Marischka]], and [[Franz Antel]] enriched the popular cinema in German-speaking countries. [[Michael Haneke]] became internationally known for his disturbing cinematic studies, receiving a [[Golden Globe]] for his critically acclaimed film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' (2010).\n\nThe first Austrian director to receive an [[Academy Award]] was [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]]. A number of Austrian actors also pursued international careers, among them [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. Most notably, [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became international movie stars in Hollywood. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to fame with his performances in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' and ''[[Django Unchained]]'', earning him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010 and 2012. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a master of spectacular and astute theatre productions. [[Otto Schenk]] not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.\n\n===Science and philosophy===\n{{Further|Austrian School|Vienna circle|List of Austrian scientists}}\n[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|upright|right|175px|[[Karl Popper]]]]\nAustria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].\n\nIn addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.\n\nA focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].\n\nThe [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9s include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}\n[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Stefan Zweig]]]]\nComplementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].\n\nFamous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].\n\n===Food and beverages===\n{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}\n\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofk\u00fcche\") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"[[Apfelstrudel]]\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"[[Millirahmstrudel]]\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\nIn addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Polish cuisine|Polish]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Balkan]] and [[French cuisine|French]] cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]], a traditional Austrian dish]]\n\nTypical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Kn\u00f6del]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also K\u00e4rntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613115037/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBeer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Kr\u00fcgerl'' or ''gro\u00dfes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures.

The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].\n\nBesides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[\u00d6sterreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[\u00d6sterreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].\n\n[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]]. Other known Austrian tennis players are for example [[Horst Skoff]], [[J\u00fcrgen Melzer]] and [[Dominic Thiem]].\n\nSport played a significant role in developing national consciousness and boosting national self-confidence in the early years of the Second Republic after World War II, through events such as the [[Tour of Austria]] cycle race and through sporting successes such as the national football team's run to third at the 1954 World Cup and the performances of Toni Sailer and the rest of the \"Kitzb\u00fchel Miracle Team\" in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marschick |first=Matthias |date=Summer 2011 |title=Austrian Sport and the Challenges of Its Recent Historiography |jstor=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013198 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Norden |first=Gilbert |date=Spring 2001 |title=Austrian Sport Museums |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=87\u2013107 |access-date=3 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114031850/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |archive-date=14 January 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Austria|Tyrol}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Austria}}\n* [[Index of Austria-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Austria]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | title=The Austrians: a thousand-year odyssey | last=Brook-Shepherd | first=Gordon | publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-7867-0520-7| location=New York}}\n* {{Cite book | title=Modern Austria: empire and republic 1815\u20131986 | last=Jelavich | first=Barbara | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1987 | isbn=978-0-521-31625-5 | location=Cambridge | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/modernaustria00barb }}\n* {{Cite book | title=Introducing Austria: a short history | last=Johnson | first=Lonnie | publisher=Ariadne Press | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-929497-03-7| location=Riverside, Calif.}}\n* Rathkolb, Oliver.

Rural areas tend to lack sufficient roads that would increase access to agricultural inputs and [[Marketplace|markets]]. Without roads, the rural poor are cut off from technological development and emerging markets in more urban areas. Poor infrastructure hinders [[communication]], resulting in social isolation among the rural poor, many of whom have limited access to [[media (communication)|media]] and news outlets. Such isolation hinders integration with urban society and established markets, which could result in greater development and economic security. Moreover, poor or nonexistent irrigation systems threaten agricultural yields because of uncertainty in the supply of water for crop production. Many poor rural areas lack any irrigation to store or pump water, resulting in fewer crops, fewer days of employment and less productivity. Both a lack of roads and insufficient irrigation systems result in greater [[Work Intensity]] in many rural communities.\n\nResearchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute|ODI]] conducted a literature review to assess the relationship between all types of roads and both their security impacts and the effects of road building on access to for example health and education (service delivery) particularly in fragile, sparsely populated and/or ill-served [[rural areas]] in [[developing countries]].\n\t\nThey found no direct evidence relating to the security impact of road [[infrastructure]], and that only theoretical linkages of infrastructure development are discussed in studies. There are various direct and indirect channels through which transport infrastructure may affect security and peace building. They agree that [[infrastructure]] programmes can potentially play three roles in a fragile context: as an engine of economic recovery and improved service provision, as part of a process of strengthening institutions, and in stabilisation and peace-building.\n\nThey claim the state of evidence regarding these causal links is weak but some aspects of infrastructure development, including but not exclusive to road construction, has been shown to be effective in [[fragile state|fragile country]] contexts. Quick Impact has not yet proven to be effective in enhancing peace building and security in [[fragile state|Fragile and Conflict Affected States]].\n\nTheir literature search presented some evidence of road development resulting in employment sometimes for the most vulnerable and/or poor groups. They found  case studies show road development programmes can produce short-term employment opportunities in fragile and conflict affected regions particularly applying to programmes where rural road development is carried out through community-driven development or with special emphasis on inclusion through participatory methods. Evidence is mostly limited to number of hours of employment generated or individuals employed and include little rigorous [[impact evaluation]].\n\nThere was also some evidence that rural road construction reduced isolation for minority groups and provided more opportunities for inclusion in wider economic activity. However, this evidence did not relate directly to reducing conflict or improving security. [[Poverty]] and isolation literature defines this as access to inputs and output markets, access to education and health services, and access to labour opportunities through which road access contributes to reduced poverty.\n\nMostly qualitative evidence found suggests that rural road construction or maintenance has a positive impact on [[public service]] delivery. In general rural road development leads to improved access of both users and suppliers. This occurs due to a reduction in commuting time, as well transport costs but these benefits tend to accrue disproportionately to the influential and well-educated. [[Rural communities]] tend to ascribe great importance to road development and perceive it to improve access to markets, health and education facilities.<ref>Farhat, M. Hayes, J. January 2013, Impact of roads on security and service delivery, EPS-PEAKS (Economic and Private Sector - Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services) http://partnerplatform.org/?c5380566</ref>\n\n===Geographic barriers===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\nMoreover poverty is often a result of geographic barriers ,certain places are located in such  rigid geographic areas that development is not possible there and not only that the people living there lack access to their basic requirements, often the government in economically weaker countries takes no interest in the development of these areas and thus the people living here have to suffer from the ill effects of poverty .Major geographic barriers like remote and/or small islands and archipelagoes in a large ocean, low population, very rugged and/or especially high elevation mountainous terrain such as the Himalayas and Andes present formidable barriers to development even beyond the typical rural poverty situation.\n\n===Insufficient access to markets===\nA lack of access to [[Market (economics)|markets]] - whether due to poor infrastructure or [[productivity]], limited education, or insufficient information - prevents access to both labor and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. In many rural societies, there are few job opportunities outside of agriculture, often resulting in food and income insecurity due to the precarious nature of farming. Rural workers are largely concentrated in jobs such as owners-cultivators, tenant farmers, [[sharecroppers]], informal care workers, agricultural day-laborers, and livestock herders. Without access to other labor markets, rural workers continue to work for extremely low wages in agricultural jobs that tend to have seasonal fluctuations and thus little income security. In addition to labor, the rural poor often lack access to capital markets and financial institutions, hindering their ability to establish savings and obtain credit that could be used to purchase working capital or increase their supply of raw materials. When coupled with scarce job opportunities, poor access to credit and capital perpetuates rural poverty.<ref name=Jazairy />\n\n===Lack of non-motorised load-carrying wheeled vehicles (handcarts and wheelbarrows)===\nNumerous international development organisations have studied, reported, recommended and agreed that lack of mobility impedes human progress and development. Yet there is very little evidence of anyone attempting to actually address and alleviate the problem by introducing handcarts and wheelbarrows into remote and rural areas where they would be most beneficial.\n\n====Rural versus Urban Poverty--United States====\nIn the [[United States]], where rural poverty rates are higher and more persistent than in urban areas, rural workers are disadvantaged by lower wages and less access to better paying labor markets.<ref name=Mosely /> As a result, underemployment and informal work are more prevalent in rural areas, and where [[informal sector|formal employment]] is found, it acts as less of a buffer against poverty.<ref name=Mosely /> As a result, rural poverty in the U.S. is more persistent than urban poverty \u2013 95 percent of persistent poverty counties in the U.S. are rural, while only 2 percent of persistent poverty counties are urban.<ref name=Miller />\n\n===Opening up of economies to international trade===\nSome macro-level economic changes have been associated with an increase in spatial inequalities.<ref name=Kanbur /> There have been numerous studies showing a link between more open trade, accompanied by other [[neoliberal]] policies, and higher incidences of rural poverty and spatial inequalities<ref name=KanburR>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Xiaobo | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | title = Fifty years of regional inequality in China: a journey through central planning, reform, and openness | journal = Review of Development Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 87\u2013106 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9361.2005.00265.x | date = February 2005 | ref = harv | url = http://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/rp2004-050.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author-last1 = Rodriguez-Pose | author-first1 = Andres | author-last2 = Sanchez-Reaza | author-first2 = Javier | contribution = Economic polarization through trade: trade liberalization and regional inequality in Mexico | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Venables | editor-first2 = Anthony J. | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | pages = 237\u2013259 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://oecd.academia.edu/JavierSanchezReaza/Papers/1052652/Economic_polarization_through_trade Online version.]</ref><ref>{{Citation | author-last1 = te Velde | author-first1 = Dirk Willem | author-last2 = Morrissey | author-first2 = Oliver | contribution = Spatial inequality for manufacturing wages in five African countries | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Venables | editor-first2 = Anthony J. | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | pages = 292\u2013310 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2003/en_GB/dp2003-066/ Online version.]</ref><ref name=\"Jensen, Henning Tarp 2005. pp 69-86\">Jensen, Henning Tarp, and Finn Tarp. 2005.

Inadequate education regarding health and nutritional needs often results in under-nutrition or [[malnutrition]] among the rural poor. Social isolation due to inadequate roads and poor access to information makes acquiring [[health care]] (and affording it) particularly difficult for the rural poor, resulting in worse health and higher rates of [[infant mortality]]. There have been noted disparities in both Asia and Africa between rural and urban areas in terms of the allocation of public education and health services.<ref name=Otuska /><ref name=Sahn>Sahn, D., and D.

A similar trend is found in access to neonatal care, as those living in rural areas had far less access to care than their urban counterparts. There are also far more malnourished children in rural areas of Africa than in urban areas. In [[Zimbabwe]], for example, more than twice the share of children are malnourished in rural areas (34 percent rate of malnourishment) than in urban areas (15 percent rate of malnourishment). Inequality between urban and rural areas, and where rural poverty is most prevalent, is in countries where the adult population has the lowest amount of education. This was found in the Sahelian countries of [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] where regional inequality is 33 percent, 19.4 percent, and 21.3 percent, respectively.  In each of these countries, more than 74 percent of the adults have no education. Overall, in much of Africa, those living in rural areas experience more poverty and less access to health care and education.<ref name=Sahn />\n\n==Women and rural poverty==\nRural women are particularly disadvantaged, both as poor and as women.<ref name=Jazairy /> Women in both rural and urban areas face a higher risk of poverty and more limited economic opportunities than their male counterparts.<ref>Haynie, Dana L. and Gorman,  Bridget K. 1999.

New York: United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Chapter 3, pp. 37\u201349.</ref> Though in some nations, cultural and societal norms prevent women from working outside the home, in other countries, especially in rural communities in Africa, women work as major food producers, improving household food and income security.<ref name=WorldSurvey /><ref name=UNICEF /> Families in extreme poverty are even more dependent on women's work both inside and outside the home, resulting in longer days and more intense work for women <ref name=UNICEF /> The [[feminization of poverty]] is a concept that is applicable in both urban and rural settings.\n\n==Policies to combat rural poverty==\n\n===Land reform===\nAccess to [[land (economics)|land]] can alleviate rural poverty by providing households a productive and relatively reliable way to make an income.<ref name=Jazairy /> The rural poor often have less access to land, which contributes to their poverty. The rural poor's access to land can be improved by redistributing land from large farms above a certain size, government legislation that challenges some traditional land systems that keep land concentrated in the hands of a few, and settlement schemes which involves providing poor rural families parcels of newly developed or government owned land. Achieving legislative reform and implementing redistributive policies, however, is a difficult task in many countries because land ownership is a sensitive cultural and political issue. Yet in China, for example, land redistribution policies have found some success and are associated with a reduction in rural poverty and increased agricultural growth.<ref name=Dercon /><ref name=Ravallion />\n\n====Women and land reform====\nThe development of legal measures to improve women's access to land is linked with achieving greater gender parity.<ref name=WorldSurvey /> This requires women to have the legal right to own land, as well as designating women as individual or joint owners of land parcels redistributed during reform. It also involves allowing women to have separate tenancy rights and granting women the right to claim an equal share of family land and resources upon [[divorce]], abandonment, [[widowhood]], and for [[inheritance]] purposes.<ref name=Jazairy /> A lack of access to land and property is linked to [[poverty]], [[Human migration|migration]], [[violence]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=WorldSurvey /> Increasing a woman's access to land not only benefits herself, but also benefits her family and community both in terms of increased productivity and improved welfare for her children.<ref name=UNICEF /> Beyond just legislative reform, for laws to actually guarantee women the right to land and equal inheritance, they need to be enforced; in numerous countries, despite women achieving equal land rights, long-standing social and cultural norms continue to bias policy implementation.<ref name=Jazairy /><ref name=WorldSurvey />\n\n====Case study: Bangladesh====\nImproved infrastructure in [[Bangladesh]] increased agricultural production by 32 percent through its effect on prices and access to inputs and technology.<ref>Raisuddin, Ahmed and Mahabub, Hossain. 1990. [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/developmental-impact-rural-infrastructure-bangladesh Developmental Impact of Rural Infrastructure in Bangladesh.] BIDS Research Report 83. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute in collaboration with the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.</ref> Improving roads and transportation systems also resulted in a 33 percent increase in the household income of the poor through the ability to diversify production, as well as an increase in savings and investment and better access to financial credit. Moreover, because of increased mobility among rural households, a rise in access to social services was noted, as well as an increase in overall health.\n\n===Technology===\nThe development of appropriate [[technology]] can raise a farm's [[productivity]].<ref name=Jazairy /> Successful technological developments that aid the rural poor are achieved through bottom-up policies that involve technological [[innovations]] that require few external inputs and little monetary investment. The most effective innovations are based on the active participation of small farmers, who are involved in both defining the problems and implementing and evaluating solutions. Smallholder technological developments have focused on processes such as nutrient recycling, integrated pest management, integration of crop agriculture and livestock, use of inland and marine water sources, soil conservation, and use of genetic engineering and biotechnology to reduce fertilizer requirements.\n\n===Access to credit===\nProviding access to [[credit (finance)|credit]] and financial services provides an entry point to improve rural productivity as well as stimulating small-scale trading and manufacturing.<ref name=Janvry /><ref name=Jazairy /> With credit, rural farmers are able to purchase capital that increases their productivity and income. Increased credit helps expand markets to rural areas, thus promoting rural development. The ability to acquire credit also combats systems of bonded or exploitative labor by encouraging self-employment. Credit policy is most effective when provided in conjunction with other services such as technology and marketing training.\n\n===Diversification===\n[[Agricultural diversification]] can provide rural families with higher [[income]] and greater [[food security]].<ref name=Jazairy /> Diversification, or a reallocation of some of a farm's productive resources, reduces farming risk, especially risk related to unpredictable or extreme weather that may be due to climate change. Policies related to diversification have also focused on [[crop rotation]] to increase productivity, as well as improving the production of traditional food crops such as cassava, cowpeas, plantains, and bananas rather than promoting the growth of more precarious cash crops. These crops tend to be at the core of farming systems among the rural poor and are generally more drought resistant and can survive under poor soil conditions.

Rural areas tend to lack sufficient roads that would increase access to agricultural inputs and [[Marketplace|markets]]. Without roads, the rural poor are cut off from technological development and emerging markets in more urban areas. Poor infrastructure hinders [[communication]], resulting in social isolation among the rural poor, many of whom have limited access to [[media (communication)|media]] and news outlets. Such isolation hinders integration with urban society and established markets, which could result in greater development and economic security. Moreover, poor or nonexistent irrigation systems threaten agricultural yields because of uncertainty in the supply of water for crop production. Many poor rural areas lack any irrigation to store or pump water, resulting in fewer crops, fewer days of employment and less productivity. Both a lack of roads and insufficient irrigation systems result in greater [[Work Intensity]] in many rural communities.\n\nResearchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute|ODI]] conducted a literature review to assess the relationship between all types of roads and both their security impacts and the effects of road building on access to for example health and education (service delivery) particularly in fragile, sparsely populated and/or ill-served [[rural areas]] in [[developing countries]].\n\t\nThey found no direct evidence relating to the security impact of road [[infrastructure]], and that only theoretical linkages of infrastructure development are discussed in studies. There are various direct and indirect channels through which transport infrastructure may affect security and peace building. They agree that [[infrastructure]] programmes can potentially play three roles in a fragile context: as an engine of economic recovery and improved service provision, as part of a process of strengthening institutions, and in stabilisation and peace-building.\n\nThey claim the state of evidence regarding these causal links is weak but some aspects of infrastructure development, including but not exclusive to road construction, has been shown to be effective in [[fragile state|fragile country]] contexts. Quick Impact has not yet proven to be effective in enhancing peace building and security in [[fragile state|Fragile and Conflict Affected States]].\n\nTheir literature search presented some evidence of road development resulting in employment sometimes for the most vulnerable and/or poor groups. They found  case studies show road development programmes can produce short-term employment opportunities in fragile and conflict affected regions particularly applying to programmes where rural road development is carried out through community-driven development or with special emphasis on inclusion through participatory methods. Evidence is mostly limited to number of hours of employment generated or individuals employed and include little rigorous [[impact evaluation]].\n\nThere was also some evidence that rural road construction reduced isolation for minority groups and provided more opportunities for inclusion in wider economic activity. However, this evidence did not relate directly to reducing conflict or improving security. [[Poverty]] and isolation literature defines this as access to inputs and output markets, access to education and health services, and access to labour opportunities through which road access contributes to reduced poverty.\n\nMostly qualitative evidence found suggests that rural road construction or maintenance has a positive impact on [[public service]] delivery. In general rural road development leads to improved access of both users and suppliers. This occurs due to a reduction in commuting time, as well transport costs but these benefits tend to accrue disproportionately to the influential and well-educated. [[Rural communities]] tend to ascribe great importance to road development and perceive it to improve access to markets, health and education facilities.<ref>Farhat, M. Hayes, J. January 2013, Impact of roads on security and service delivery, EPS-PEAKS (Economic and Private Sector - Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services) http://partnerplatform.org/?c5380566</ref>\n\n===Geographic barriers===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\nMoreover poverty is often a result of geographic barriers ,certain places are located in such  rigid geographic areas that development is not possible there and not only that the people living there lack access to their basic requirements, often the government in economically weaker countries takes no interest in the development of these areas and thus the people living here have to suffer from the ill effects of poverty .Major geographic barriers like remote and/or small islands and archipelagoes in a large ocean, low population, very rugged and/or especially high elevation mountainous terrain such as the Himalayas and Andes present formidable barriers to development even beyond the typical rural poverty situation.\n\n===Insufficient access to markets===\nA lack of access to [[Market (economics)|markets]] - whether due to poor infrastructure or [[productivity]], limited education, or insufficient information - prevents access to both labor and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. In many rural societies, there are few job opportunities outside of agriculture, often resulting in food and income insecurity due to the precarious nature of farming. Rural workers are largely concentrated in jobs such as owners-cultivators, tenant farmers, [[sharecroppers]], informal care workers, agricultural day-laborers, and livestock herders. Without access to other labor markets, rural workers continue to work for extremely low wages in agricultural jobs that tend to have seasonal fluctuations and thus little income security. In addition to labor, the rural poor often lack access to capital markets and financial institutions, hindering their ability to establish savings and obtain credit that could be used to purchase working capital or increase their supply of raw materials. When coupled with scarce job opportunities, poor access to credit and capital perpetuates rural poverty.<ref name=Jazairy />\n\n===Lack of non-motorised load-carrying wheeled vehicles (handcarts and wheelbarrows)===\nNumerous international development organisations have studied, reported, recommended and agreed that lack of mobility impedes human progress and development. Yet there is very little evidence of anyone attempting to actually address and alleviate the problem by introducing handcarts and wheelbarrows into remote and rural areas where they would be most beneficial.\n\n====Rural versus Urban Poverty--United States====\nIn the [[United States]], where rural poverty rates are higher and more persistent than in urban areas, rural workers are disadvantaged by lower wages and less access to better paying labor markets.<ref name=Mosely /> As a result, underemployment and informal work are more prevalent in rural areas, and where [[informal sector|formal employment]] is found, it acts as less of a buffer against poverty.<ref name=Mosely /> As a result, rural poverty in the U.S. is more persistent than urban poverty \u2013 95 percent of persistent poverty counties in the U.S. are rural, while only 2 percent of persistent poverty counties are urban.<ref name=Miller />\n\n===Opening up of economies to international trade===\nSome macro-level economic changes have been associated with an increase in spatial inequalities.<ref name=Kanbur /> There have been numerous studies showing a link between more open trade, accompanied by other [[neoliberal]] policies, and higher incidences of rural poverty and spatial inequalities<ref name=KanburR>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Xiaobo | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | title = Fifty years of regional inequality in China: a journey through central planning, reform, and openness | journal = Review of Development Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 87\u2013106 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9361.2005.00265.x | date = February 2005 | ref = harv | url = http://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/rp2004-050.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author-last1 = Rodriguez-Pose | author-first1 = Andres | author-last2 = Sanchez-Reaza | author-first2 = Javier | contribution = Economic polarization through trade: trade liberalization and regional inequality in Mexico | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Venables | editor-first2 = Anthony J. | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | pages = 237\u2013259 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://oecd.academia.edu/JavierSanchezReaza/Papers/1052652/Economic_polarization_through_trade Online version.]</ref><ref>{{Citation | author-last1 = te Velde | author-first1 = Dirk Willem | author-last2 = Morrissey | author-first2 = Oliver | contribution = Spatial inequality for manufacturing wages in five African countries | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Venables | editor-first2 = Anthony J. | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | pages = 292\u2013310 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2003/en_GB/dp2003-066/ Online version.]</ref><ref name=\"Jensen, Henning Tarp 2005. pp 69-86\">Jensen, Henning Tarp, and Finn Tarp. 2005.

Inadequate education regarding health and nutritional needs often results in under-nutrition or [[malnutrition]] among the rural poor. Social isolation due to inadequate roads and poor access to information makes acquiring [[health care]] (and affording it) particularly difficult for the rural poor, resulting in worse health and higher rates of [[infant mortality]]. There have been noted disparities in both Asia and Africa between rural and urban areas in terms of the allocation of public education and health services.<ref name=Otuska /><ref name=Sahn>Sahn, D., and D.

A similar trend is found in access to neonatal care, as those living in rural areas had far less access to care than their urban counterparts. There are also far more malnourished children in rural areas of Africa than in urban areas. In [[Zimbabwe]], for example, more than twice the share of children are malnourished in rural areas (34 percent rate of malnourishment) than in urban areas (15 percent rate of malnourishment). Inequality between urban and rural areas, and where rural poverty is most prevalent, is in countries where the adult population has the lowest amount of education. This was found in the Sahelian countries of [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] where regional inequality is 33 percent, 19.4 percent, and 21.3 percent, respectively.  In each of these countries, more than 74 percent of the adults have no education. Overall, in much of Africa, those living in rural areas experience more poverty and less access to health care and education.<ref name=Sahn />\n\n==Women and rural poverty==\nRural women are particularly disadvantaged, both as poor and as women.<ref name=Jazairy /> Women in both rural and urban areas face a higher risk of poverty and more limited economic opportunities than their male counterparts.<ref>Haynie, Dana L. and Gorman,  Bridget K. 1999.

The rural poor's access to land can be improved by redistributing land from large farms above a certain size, government legislation that challenges some traditional land systems that keep land concentrated in the hands of a few, and settlement schemes which involves providing poor rural families parcels of newly developed or government owned land. Achieving legislative reform and implementing redistributive policies, however, is a difficult task in many countries because land ownership is a sensitive cultural and political issue. Yet in China, for example, land redistribution policies have found some success and are associated with a reduction in rural poverty and increased agricultural growth.<ref name=Dercon /><ref name=Ravallion />\n\n====Women and land reform====\nThe development of legal measures to improve women's access to land is linked with achieving greater gender parity.<ref name=WorldSurvey /> This requires women to have the legal right to own land, as well as designating women as individual or joint owners of land parcels redistributed during reform. It also involves allowing women to have separate tenancy rights and granting women the right to claim an equal share of family land and resources upon [[divorce]], abandonment, [[widowhood]], and for [[inheritance]] purposes.<ref name=Jazairy /> A lack of access to land and property is linked to [[poverty]], [[Human migration|migration]], [[violence]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=WorldSurvey /> Increasing a woman's access to land not only benefits herself, but also benefits her family and community both in terms of increased productivity and improved welfare for her children.<ref name=UNICEF /> Beyond just legislative reform, for laws to actually guarantee women the right to land and equal inheritance, they need to be enforced; in numerous countries, despite women achieving equal land rights, long-standing social and cultural norms continue to bias policy implementation.<ref name=Jazairy /><ref name=WorldSurvey />\n\n====Case study: Bangladesh====\nImproved infrastructure in [[Bangladesh]] increased agricultural production by 32 percent through its effect on prices and access to inputs and technology.<ref>Raisuddin, Ahmed and Mahabub, Hossain. 1990. [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/developmental-impact-rural-infrastructure-bangladesh Developmental Impact of Rural Infrastructure in Bangladesh.] BIDS Research Report 83. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute in collaboration with the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.</ref> Improving roads and transportation systems also resulted in a 33 percent increase in the household income of the poor through the ability to diversify production, as well as an increase in savings and investment and better access to financial credit. Moreover, because of increased mobility among rural households, a rise in access to social services was noted, as well as an increase in overall health.\n\n===Technology===\nThe development of appropriate [[technology]] can raise a farm's [[productivity]].<ref name=Jazairy /> Successful technological developments that aid the rural poor are achieved through bottom-up policies that involve technological [[innovations]] that require few external inputs and little monetary investment. The most effective innovations are based on the active participation of small farmers, who are involved in both defining the problems and implementing and evaluating solutions. Smallholder technological developments have focused on processes such as nutrient recycling, integrated pest management, integration of crop agriculture and livestock, use of inland and marine water sources, soil conservation, and use of genetic engineering and biotechnology to reduce fertilizer requirements.\n\n===Access to credit===\nProviding access to [[credit (finance)|credit]] and financial services provides an entry point to improve rural productivity as well as stimulating small-scale trading and manufacturing.<ref name=Janvry /><ref name=Jazairy /> With credit, rural farmers are able to purchase capital that increases their productivity and income. Increased credit helps expand markets to rural areas, thus promoting rural development. The ability to acquire credit also combats systems of bonded or exploitative labor by encouraging self-employment. Credit policy is most effective when provided in conjunction with other services such as technology and marketing training.\n\n===Diversification===\n[[Agricultural diversification]] can provide rural families with higher [[income]] and greater [[food security]].<ref name=Jazairy /> Diversification, or a reallocation of some of a farm's productive resources, reduces farming risk, especially risk related to unpredictable or extreme weather that may be due to climate change. Policies related to diversification have also focused on [[crop rotation]] to increase productivity, as well as improving the production of traditional food crops such as cassava, cowpeas, plantains, and bananas rather than promoting the growth of more precarious cash crops. These crops tend to be at the core of farming systems among the rural poor and are generally more drought resistant and can survive under poor soil conditions. Improving the productivity and marketing of these crops promotes food and income security among rural households.<ref name=Jazairy />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Capability approach]]\n* [[Economic inequality]]\n* [[Empowerment]]\n* [[Feminization of poverty]]\n* [[Food security]]\n* [[Gender equality]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Millennium Development Goals]]\n* [[Poverty]]\n* [[Subsistence agriculture]]\n* [[Rural development]]\n* [[Water scarcity in Africa]]\n* [[Work Intensity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Page numbers needed|date=April 2012}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Arcury | first1 = Thomas A. | last2 = Preisser | first2 = John S. | last3 = Gesler | first3 = Wilbert M. | last4 = Powers | first4 = James M. | title = Access to transportation and health care utilization in a rural region | journal = The Journal of Rural Health | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 31\u201338 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-0361.2005.tb00059.x | pmid = 15667007 | date = January 2005 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Bern-Klug | first1 = Mercedes | last2 = Barnes | first2 = Nancy D. | title = Income characteristics of rural older women and implications for health status | journal = [[Journal of Women & Aging]] | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 27\u201337 | doi = 10.1300/J074v11n01_03 | pmid = 10323044 | date = January 1999 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite book | last1 = Burns | first1 = Austra | last2 = Bruce | first2 = David | last3 = Marlin | first3 = Amanda | title = Rural poverty (discussion paper) | pages = 1\u201389 | url = http://www5.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/rural/doc/poverty_pauvrete_e.pdf | date = 2013 | ref = harv }} Prepared for the Rural Secretariat, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Government of Canada.\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Daneman | first1 = N. | last2 = Lu | first2 = H. | last3 = Redelmeier | first3 = D. | title = Discharge after discharge: predicting surgical site infections after patients leave hospital | journal = Journal of Hospital Infection | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 188\u2013194 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhin.2010.01.029  | pmid = 20435375 | date = July 2010 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Yin | first1 = Jan | last2 = Quan | first2 = Hude | last3 = Cujec | first3 = Bibiana | last4 = Johnson | first4 = David | title = Rural and urban outcomes after hospitalization for congestive heart failure in Alberta, Canada | journal = Journal of Cardiac Failure | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 278\u2013285 | doi = 10.1054/jcaf.2003.43 | pmid = 13680548 | date = August 2003 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Menec | first1 = Verena H. | last2 = Nowicki | first2 = Scott | last3 = Kalischuk | first3 = Alison | title = Transfers to acute care hospitals at the end of life: do rural/remote regions differ from urban regions? | journal = Rural and Remote Health | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1281\u20131295 | pmid = 20095758 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.rrh.org.au/articles/subviewnew.asp?ArticleID=1281 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Mitton | first1 = Craig | last2 = O'Neil | first2 = David | last3 = Simpson | first3 = Liz | last4 = Hoppins | first4 = Yvonne | last5 = Harcus | first5 = Sue | title = Nurse-physician collaborative partnership: a rural model for the chronically ill | journal = Canadian Journal of Rural Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 208\u2013216 | pmid = 18076814 | date = Fall 2007 | url = https://www.srpc.ca/PDF/cjrm/vol12n4/pg208.pdf | ref = harv | access-date = June 17, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617123940/https://www.srpc.ca/PDF/cjrm/vol12n4/pg208.pdf | archive-date = June 17, 2015 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Saposnik | first1 = G. | last2 = Jeerakathil | first2 = T. | last3 = Selchen | first3 = D. | last4 = Baibergenova | first4 = A. | last5 = Hachinski | first5 = V. | last6 = Kapral | first6 = M. | title = Socioeconomic status, hospital volume, and stroke fatality in Canada | journal = [[Stroke (journal)|Stroke]] | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | pages = 3360\u20133366 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.521344 | pmid = 18772443 | date = Fall 2007 | ref = harv | doi-access = free }}\n\n{{Deprivation Indicators}}\n\n[[Category:Poverty]]\n[[Category:Rural culture]]\n", "name_user": "Best5update", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eit is dead link i have change regarding poorest country in the world", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_poverty"}

The battle ended at nightfall, with the victory remaining a matter of opinion: that the Parliamentarian foot were still in position at nightfall when, as the Royalists themselves admitted, they drew back a little; or that next morning the Royalists occupied the field after the Parliamentarians retreated in the night. The Royalists had captured eight guns, but the Parliamentarians considered their killing of the enemy commander, the Earl of Northampton, of equal significance.\n\n==Background==\nGell had successfully taken the town of [[Lichfield]] in Staffordshire and was on his way with about 1,500 men and some [[artillery]] pieces to join Brereton in a projected attack on the town of [[Stafford]].\n\n==Battle==\nThey met at [[Hopton, Staffordshire|Hopton Heath]] and were attacked there by the Royalists, whose force consisted of about 1,100 cavalry, 100 foot and artillery, including a large artillery piece called Roaring Meg - which must not be confused with the siege mortar \"[[Roaring Meg (cannon)|Roaring Meg]]\" which was cast in 1646 for the siege of Goodrich Castle.\n\nAfter an artillery barrage the Royalist cavalry charged the entrenched Parliamentarians, putting Gell's [[dragoons]] and his and Brereton's horse to flight. A second charge was repelled by Gell's musketeers and Northampton was unhorsed. He refused to surrender and was killed.\n\n==Nighttime withdrawals==\nDuring the night the Royalists retired towards Stafford to regroup, and the Parliamentarian troops withdrew towards Chartley, leaving a large part of Gell's artillery in Royalist hands. Brereton withdrew to [[Nantwich]] while Gell marched through [[Uttoxeter]] to [[Derby]], taking Northampton's body with him. He attempted to ransom the Earl's body for the return of the captured artillery pieces, without success.
