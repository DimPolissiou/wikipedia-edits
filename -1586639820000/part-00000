The character was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and artist [[Val Mayerik]]. Howard the Duck first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #19 ([[cover-date]]d Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, [[anthropomorphic]] \"[[funny animal]]\" trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads 'Trapped In a World He Never Made!'\n\nHoward's adventures are generally social [[satire]]s, while a few are [[parody|parodies]] of [[genre fiction]] with a [[metafiction]]al awareness of the medium. The book is [[existentialist]], and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: \"...&nbsp;that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view.\"<ref name=mediascene /> This is diametrically opposed to screenwriter [[Gloria Katz]], who, in adapting the comic to the screen, declared, \"It's a film about a duck from outer space ... It's not supposed to be an existential experience\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/foom/126874125950897.htm |title=F.O.O.M.

Howard co-creator Val Mayerik co-plotted the story and provided the art. It was released alongside an adaptation of the ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' feature film, which was published in ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'' #41 (November 1986) and a three-issue comic-book series.\n\nGerber returned to Howard in 1989 in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #14\u201317. The character was again living with Beverly Switzler, now working as a rent-a-[[ninja]]. How they got back together was never explained. Beverly was not involved in the story in which She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from [[Empire State University]].\n\nGerber's next story featuring Howard appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' #5 (December 1996), around the same time he was writing a \"[[Savage Dragon]]/Destroyer Duck\" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was scheduled to appear in ''[[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]], and issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],'' as well as the three issue ''[[Daydreamers (comics)|Daydreamers]]'' miniseries by [[J.M.

But in the ''Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck'' crossover comic, Elf with a Gun creates thousands of clones of Howard and Beverly during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse, they reveal that they rescued the \"real\" Howard and Beverly, while Spider-Man left with two of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed \"Leonard the Duck\", and Beverly has her hair dyed black and is renamed \"Rhonda Martini\". Leonard later had a cameo appearance in ''Savage Dragon'' #41, and Leonard and Rhonda have a single-panel cameo when they meet Gerber's [[Nevada (comics)|Nevada]] in [[Vertigo Comics]]' ''Winter's Edge'' #2.\n\nIn 2001, when Marvel launched its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of \"mature readers\" comics, Gerber returned to write a six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]] illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. The series has [[Doctor Bong]] causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of [[Mickey Mouse]], in retaliation for the Disney-mandated redesign), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell.\n\nHoward had cameo appearances in ''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #9 in February 2005 and in ''She-Hulk'' vol. 3 #3/#100 in February 2006 (issue #3 was also the numbered as the 100th total issue of all the various She-Hulk series). In 2007, he returned in ''Howard the Duck'' vol. 4 #1-4, a miniseries by writer [[Ty Templeton]] and artist [[Juan Bobillo]]. This series was rated for ages 9 and up, though one issue was published with a ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.\n\nIn November 2014, Marvel announced an ongoing series starting in March 2015 featuring Howard as a [[private investigator]] on Earth.

His series' tagline, \"Trapped in a world he never made\", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]].\n\nHis near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native Beverly Switzler.

Howard has worked with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Man-Thing]] on various occasions.\n\nHoward found himself on Earth due to a shift in the \"Cosmic Axis\" from a world similar to Earth, but where there are \"more ducks\" and \"apes don't talk\". In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it \"very pedestrian\" and 'comic-booky' \u2014 in the worst sense of the term.\" Gerber stated that Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of anthropomorphic animals and not Duckworld.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|title= Mad Genius, Angry Fowl|first= Nate|last= Shelton|date= November 2001|publisher= Diamond Previews Online|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304034542/http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|archivedate=March 4, 2012 |url-status= live|accessdate= April 6, 2007|quote= The title character was no super-hero; he was just a cantankerous little guy named Howard who was, in the words of his creator, \"the living embodiment of all that is querulous, opinionated, and uncool\"\u2026and happened to hail from an alternate Earth populated by \"funny\" cartoon animals.}}</ref> A panel in ''Fear'' #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a panel about hypothetical other dimensions. Gerber later depicted his character [[Destroyer Duck]] as existing in such a world.\n\nHis antagonists (who usually appear in a single story each) are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, as well as frequent parodies of political figures and organizations. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as [[Doctor Bong]] \u2013 modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] \u2013 is a former [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporter who has the power to \"reorder reality\" by smashing himself on the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet on his head and his main goal is to marry Beverly. Beverly eventually agreed to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, but the two were divorced shortly thereafter. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady, an older woman who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] (\"Moonies\"). Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency), whose leader was implied to be [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley|smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.\n\nOther Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared with Howard, including [[Spider-Man]], the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]. [[Omega the Unknown]] appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man and the founding members of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on other occasions.\n\nSeemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Albert Camus]] (whose novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' Gerber considers the principal influence on the comic series),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|title= Steve Gerber: An Absurd Journey Part I |first= Darren|last= Schroeder|date= June 7, 2001|publisher= SilverBulletComicBooks.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121130214049/http://comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|archivedate=November 30, 2012 |url-status= dead|accessdate= February 3, 2013|quote= I suppose that would be Albert Camus's ''The Stranger'', which I encountered my first or second year of college.

The character was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and artist [[Val Mayerik]]. Howard the Duck first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #19 ([[cover-date]]d Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, [[anthropomorphic]] \"[[funny animal]]\" trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads 'Trapped In a World He Never Made!'\n\nHoward's adventures are generally social [[satire]]s, while a few are [[parody|parodies]] of [[genre fiction]] with a [[metafiction]]al awareness of the medium. The book is [[existentialist]], and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: \"...&nbsp;that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view.\"<ref name=mediascene /> This is diametrically opposed to screenwriter [[Gloria Katz]], who, in adapting the comic to the screen, declared, \"It's a film about a duck from outer space ...

Howard co-creator Val Mayerik co-plotted the story and provided the art. It was released alongside an adaptation of the ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' feature film, which was published in ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'' #41 (November 1986) and a three-issue comic-book series.\n\nGerber returned to Howard in 1989 in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #14\u201317. The character was again living with Beverly Switzler, now working as a rent-a-[[ninja]]. How they got back together was never explained. Beverly was not involved in the story in which She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from [[Empire State University]].\n\nGerber's next story featuring Howard appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' #5 (December 1996), around the same time he was writing a \"[[Savage Dragon]]/Destroyer Duck\" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was scheduled to appear in ''[[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]], and issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],'' as well as the three issue ''[[Daydreamers (comics)|Daydreamers]]'' miniseries by [[J.M. DeMatteis]]. Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the \"unofficial crossover\" somewhat.<ref name=\"Gerber2007\">{{cite web |url=  http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/|title= \u2026and it's not like you're going to read about it on the Steve Gerber Web site|first= Steve|last= Gerber|date= January 17, 2007|publisher= SteveGerberBlog|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013040916/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%E2%80%99s-not-like-you%E2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/|archivedate=October 13, 2007 |url-status= dead|accessdate= February 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5, [[Spider-Man]], Beverly and Howard meet the [[Elf with a Gun]] and two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, grab a disc, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the ''Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck'' crossover comic, Elf with a Gun creates thousands of clones of Howard and Beverly during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse, they reveal that they rescued the \"real\" Howard and Beverly, while Spider-Man left with two of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed \"Leonard the Duck\", and Beverly has her hair dyed black and is renamed \"Rhonda Martini\". Leonard later had a cameo appearance in ''Savage Dragon'' #41, and Leonard and Rhonda have a single-panel cameo when they meet Gerber's [[Nevada (comics)|Nevada]] in [[Vertigo Comics]]' ''Winter's Edge'' #2.\n\nIn 2001, when Marvel launched its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of \"mature readers\" comics, Gerber returned to write a six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]] illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. The series has [[Doctor Bong]] causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of [[Mickey Mouse]], in retaliation for the Disney-mandated redesign), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell.\n\nHoward had cameo appearances in ''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #9 in February 2005 and in ''She-Hulk'' vol. 3 #3/#100 in February 2006 (issue #3 was also the numbered as the 100th total issue of all the various She-Hulk series). In 2007, he returned in ''Howard the Duck'' vol. 4 #1-4, a miniseries by writer [[Ty Templeton]] and artist [[Juan Bobillo]]. This series was rated for ages 9 and up, though one issue was published with a ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.\n\nIn November 2014, Marvel announced an ongoing series starting in March 2015 featuring Howard as a [[private investigator]] on Earth.

Howard tries on various outfits, including ones akin to Donald Duck's sailor uniform and [[Uncle Scrooge]]'s coat and [[top hat]], before settling on his new attire of a business suit complete with trousers. Although Howard sulks that he has lost, Beverly reassures him that she does not want him to be a victim of a mob, and loves him no matter what he wears.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= Janson, Klaus|story= Animal Indecency!|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= December 1979}}</ref>\n\nHoward has an irritable and cynical attitude towards the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, \"Trapped in a world he never made\", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]].\n\nHis near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though as a beautiful woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter named the Winky Man) and Winda Wester (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ing\u00e9nue with [[psychic]] powers). Howard has worked with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Man-Thing]] on various occasions.\n\nHoward found himself on Earth due to a shift in the \"Cosmic Axis\" from a world similar to Earth, but where there are \"more ducks\" and \"apes don't talk\". In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it \"very pedestrian\" and 'comic-booky' \u2014 in the worst sense of the term.\" Gerber stated that Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of anthropomorphic animals and not Duckworld.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|title= Mad Genius, Angry Fowl|first= Nate|last= Shelton|date= November 2001|publisher= Diamond Previews Online|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304034542/http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|archivedate=March 4, 2012 |url-status= live|accessdate= April 6, 2007|quote= The title character was no super-hero; he was just a cantankerous little guy named Howard who was, in the words of his creator, \"the living embodiment of all that is querulous, opinionated, and uncool\"\u2026and happened to hail from an alternate Earth populated by \"funny\" cartoon animals.}}</ref> A panel in ''Fear'' #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a panel about hypothetical other dimensions. Gerber later depicted his character [[Destroyer Duck]] as existing in such a world.\n\nHis antagonists (who usually appear in a single story each) are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, as well as frequent parodies of political figures and organizations. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as [[Doctor Bong]] \u2013 modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] \u2013 is a former [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporter who has the power to \"reorder reality\" by smashing himself on the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet on his head and his main goal is to marry Beverly. Beverly eventually agreed to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, but the two were divorced shortly thereafter. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady, an older woman who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] (\"Moonies\"). Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency), whose leader was implied to be [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley|smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.\n\nOther Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared with Howard, including [[Spider-Man]], the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]. [[Omega the Unknown]] appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man and the founding members of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on other occasions.\n\nSeemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Albert Camus]] (whose novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' Gerber considers the principal influence on the comic series),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|title= Steve Gerber: An Absurd Journey Part I |first= Darren|last= Schroeder|date= June 7, 2001|publisher= SilverBulletComicBooks.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121130214049/http://comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|archivedate=November 30, 2012 |url-status= dead|accessdate= February 3, 2013|quote= I suppose that would be Albert Camus's ''The Stranger'', which I encountered my first or second year of college.

Its natural range extends from southeastern [[Canada]], southwest to the edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]], as far east as [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Florida]]. The three species of ''[[Chelydra]]'' and the larger [[alligator snapping turtle]]s (genus ''[[Macrochelys]]'') are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biology of the Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina)|year=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=5\u201313|author=Ernst, C.H.|editor1=A.C.

In water, they are likely to flee and hide themselves underwater in sediment. Snapping turtles have a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and [[semelparity and iteroparity|iteroparity]] (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event. Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15\u201320 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years.<ref name=\"adw\">{{cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/ec/CW69-14-565-2009E.pdf|title=COSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Snapping Turtle ''Chelydra serpentina''}}</ref>\n\n==Anatomy and morphology==\n[[File:Common Snapping Turtle Close Up.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up in [[Taum Sauk Mountain State Park]]]]\n[[File:Snapper2.jpg|thumb|left|Head]]\n[[File:Chelydra-serpentina3.jpg|thumb|left|Skull]]\n[[File:Chelydra serpentinaHolbrookV1P23A.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from [[John Edwards Holbrook|Holbrook]]'s ''North American Herpetology'', 1842]]\n''C. serpentina'' has a rugged, muscular build with a ridged [[carapace]] (upper shell), although ridges tend to be more pronounced in younger individuals.

Some may inhabit [[brackish water|brackish]] environments, such as [[estuary|estuaries]]. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask\u2014though rarely observed\u2014by floating on the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snapping turtles may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). Snapping turtles [[omnivore|consume both plant and animal matter]], and are important aquatic scavengers, but they are also active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[frog]]s, [[reptile]]s (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary [[bird]]s, and small [[mammal]]s. In some areas, adult snapping turtles can be incidentally detrimental to breeding [[waterfowl]], as they will occasionally take ducklings and goslings but their effect on such prey is frequently exaggerated.<ref>Hammer, D.A.

Pollution, [[habitat destruction]], food scarcity, overcrowding, and other factors drive snappers to move; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. Experimental data supports the idea that snapping turtles can sense the Earth's magnetic field, which could also be used for such movements (together with a variety of other possible orientation cues).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Painter|first2=Michael S.|last3=Youmans|first3=Paul W.|last4=Hopkins|first4=William A.|last5=Phillips|first5=John B.|date=2015-05-15|title=Spontaneous Magnetic Alignment by Yearling Snapping Turtles: Rapid Association of Radio Frequency Dependent Pattern of Magnetic Input with Novel Surroundings|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0124728|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124728|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4433231|pmid=25978736|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1024728L}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Congdon|first=Justin D.|last2=Pappas|first2=Michael J.|last3=Krenz|first3=John D.|last4=Brecke|first4=Bruce J.|last5=Schlenner|first5=Meredith|date=2015-02-27|title=Compass Orientation During Dispersal of Freshwater Hatchling Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) and Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii)|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=121|issue=6|pages=538\u2013547|doi=10.1111/eth.12366|issn=0179-1613}}</ref> This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold [[spermatozoa|sperm]] for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often some distance from the water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the [[nest]] with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The common snapping turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; radiotelemetry studies have shown some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/emrrp/turtles/species/comsnap.html |title=US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, Environmental Laboratory: Common Snapping Turtle (''Chelydra serpentina'') |access-date=2013-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331020305/http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/emrrp/turtles/species/comsnap.html |archive-date=2013-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hibernating snapping turtles do not breathe for, in the northern part of their range, more than six months since ice covers their hibernating site.

If they cannot get enough oxygen through this method they start to utilize anaerobic pathways, burning sugars and fats without the use of oxygen.

Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if picked up by the sides of its shell. The claws are about as sharp as those of [[dog]]s, but cannot be trimmed as can dog claws. Despite this, a snapping turtle cannot use its claws for either attacking (its legs have no speed or strength in \"swiping\" motions) or eating (no opposable thumbs), but only as aids for digging and gripping. Veterinary care is best left to a reptile specialist. A wild common snapping turtle will make a hissing sound when it is threatened or encountered, but they prefer not to invoke confrontations.\n\nIt is a common misconception that common snapping turtles may be safely picked up by the tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the [[vertebra]]l column.<ref name=\"blog\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thatpetplace.com/thatreptileblog/2008/06/24/handling-snapping-turtles-chelydra-serpentina-and-other-large-turtles/|title=Handling Snapping Turtles, Chelydra serpentina, and Other Large Turtles|last=Indiviglio|first=Frank|date=2008-06-24|work=That Reptile Blog|publisher=That Pet Place|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous. Snappers can stretch their necks back across their own carapace and to their hind feet on either side to bite. When they feel stressed, they release a musky odor from behind their legs.\n\nIt may be tempting to rescue a snapping turtle found on a road by getting it to bite a stick and then dragging it out of immediate danger. This action can, however, severely scrape the legs and underside of the turtle and lead to deadly infections in the wounds. The safest way to pick up a common snapping turtle is by grasping the carapace above the back legs. There is a large gap above the back legs that allows for easy grasping of the carapace and keeps hands safe from both the beak and claws of the turtle. It can also be picked up with a shovel, from the back, making sure the shovel is square across the bottom of the shell. The easiest way, though, is with a blanket or tarp, picking up the corners with the turtle in the middle.\n\nSnapping turtles are raised on some [[turtle farm]]s in China.<ref>Fang Anning (\u65b9\u5b89\u5b81), \"[http://www.gui138.cn/xinwen/gbxw/201007/765.html \u201c\u5c0f\u5ead\u9662\u201d\u517b\u6b96\u9f9f\u9cd6\u5927\u6709\u8d5a\u5934] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032241/http://www.gui138.cn/xinwen/gbxw/201007/765.html |date=2016-03-04 }}\" (Small-scale turtle farming may be very profitable).

Its natural range extends from southeastern [[Canada]], southwest to the edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]], as far east as [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Florida]]. The three species of ''[[Chelydra]]'' and the larger [[alligator snapping turtle]]s (genus ''[[Macrochelys]]'') are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biology of the Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina)|year=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=5\u201313|author=Ernst, C.H.|editor1=A.C.

In water, they are likely to flee and hide themselves underwater in sediment. Snapping turtles have a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and [[semelparity and iteroparity|iteroparity]] (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event. Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15\u201320 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years.<ref name=\"adw\">{{cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/ec/CW69-14-565-2009E.pdf|title=COSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Snapping Turtle ''Chelydra serpentina''}}</ref>\n\n==Anatomy and morphology==\n[[File:Common Snapping Turtle Close Up.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up in [[Taum Sauk Mountain State Park]]]]\n[[File:Snapper2.jpg|thumb|left|Head]]\n[[File:Chelydra-serpentina3.jpg|thumb|left|Skull]]\n[[File:Chelydra serpentinaHolbrookV1P23A.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from [[John Edwards Holbrook|Holbrook]]'s ''North American Herpetology'', 1842]]\n''C. serpentina'' has a rugged, muscular build with a ridged [[carapace]] (upper shell), although ridges tend to be more pronounced in younger individuals.

Some may inhabit [[brackish water|brackish]] environments, such as [[estuary|estuaries]]. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask\u2014though rarely observed\u2014by floating on the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snapping turtles may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). Snapping turtles [[omnivore|consume both plant and animal matter]], and are important aquatic scavengers, but they are also active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[frog]]s, [[reptile]]s (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary [[bird]]s, and small [[mammal]]s. In some areas, adult snapping turtles can be incidentally detrimental to breeding [[waterfowl]], as they will occasionally take ducklings and goslings but their effect on such prey is frequently exaggerated.<ref>Hammer, D.A.

As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack them as well as [[heron]]s (mostly [[great blue heron]]s), [[bittern]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]]s, [[American bullfrog]]s, large [[fish]], and [[snakes]].<ref name=VHS/> There are records during winter in [[Canada]] of hibernating adult common snapping turtles being ambushed and preyed on by [[northern river otter]]s.<ref name= Brooks>Brooks, R.J.; Brown, G.P.; Galbraith, D.A.

Pollution, [[habitat destruction]], food scarcity, overcrowding, and other factors drive snappers to move; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. Experimental data supports the idea that snapping turtles can sense the Earth's magnetic field, which could also be used for such movements (together with a variety of other possible orientation cues).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Painter|first2=Michael S.|last3=Youmans|first3=Paul W.|last4=Hopkins|first4=William A.|last5=Phillips|first5=John B.|date=2015-05-15|title=Spontaneous Magnetic Alignment by Yearling Snapping Turtles: Rapid Association of Radio Frequency Dependent Pattern of Magnetic Input with Novel Surroundings|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0124728|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124728|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4433231|pmid=25978736|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1024728L}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Congdon|first=Justin D.|last2=Pappas|first2=Michael J.|last3=Krenz|first3=John D.|last4=Brecke|first4=Bruce J.|last5=Schlenner|first5=Meredith|date=2015-02-27|title=Compass Orientation During Dispersal of Freshwater Hatchling Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) and Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii)|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=121|issue=6|pages=538\u2013547|doi=10.1111/eth.12366|issn=0179-1613}}</ref> This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold [[spermatozoa|sperm]] for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often some distance from the water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the [[nest]] with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The common snapping turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; radiotelemetry studies have shown some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/emrrp/turtles/species/comsnap.html |title=US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, Environmental Laboratory: Common Snapping Turtle (''Chelydra serpentina'') |access-date=2013-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331020305/http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/emrrp/turtles/species/comsnap.html |archive-date=2013-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hibernating snapping turtles do not breathe for, in the northern part of their range, more than six months since ice covers their hibernating site. These turtles can get oxygen by pushing their head out of the mud and allowing gas exchange to take place through the membranes of their mouth and throat. This is known as extrapulmonary respiration. If they cannot get enough oxygen through this method they start to utilize anaerobic pathways, burning sugars and fats without the use of oxygen. The metabolic by-products from this process are acidic and create very undesirable side effects by spring, which are known as oxygen debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/snappers.htm|title=Tortoise Trust Web - Conservation and Ecology of Snapping Turtles|first=ULf|last=Edqvist|website=www.tortoisetrust.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Although designated as \"least concern\" on the [[IUCN]] redlist, the species has been designated in the Canadian part of its range as \"Special Concern\" due to its life history being sensitive to disruption by anthropogenic activity.<ref>{{cite web|last=COSEWIC|title=Species Profile - Snapping Turtle|url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=1033|work=Species At Risk Public Registry|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics and taxonomy==\nCurrently, no [[subspecies]] of the common snapping turtle are recognized.<ref name=Rhodin>{{Anchor|CITEREFRhodin2010}}{{Cite book|url=http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_000_checklist_v3_2010.pdf |title=Turtles of the world, 2010 update: Annotated checklist of taxonomy, synonymy, distribution and conservation status |journal=Chelonian Research Monographs |volume=5 |date=2010-12-14 |author1=Rhodin, Anders G.J. |author2=van Dijk, Peter Paul |author3=Iverson, John B. |author4=Shaffer, H.

Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if picked up by the sides of its shell. The claws are about as sharp as those of [[dog]]s, but cannot be trimmed as can dog claws. Despite this, a snapping turtle cannot use its claws for either attacking (its legs have no speed or strength in \"swiping\" motions) or eating (no opposable thumbs), but only as aids for digging and gripping. Veterinary care is best left to a reptile specialist. A wild common snapping turtle will make a hissing sound when it is threatened or encountered, but they prefer not to invoke confrontations.\n\nIt is a common misconception that common snapping turtles may be safely picked up by the tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the [[vertebra]]l column.<ref name=\"blog\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thatpetplace.com/thatreptileblog/2008/06/24/handling-snapping-turtles-chelydra-serpentina-and-other-large-turtles/|title=Handling Snapping Turtles, Chelydra serpentina, and Other Large Turtles|last=Indiviglio|first=Frank|date=2008-06-24|work=That Reptile Blog|publisher=That Pet Place|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous. Snappers can stretch their necks back across their own carapace and to their hind feet on either side to bite. When they feel stressed, they release a musky odor from behind their legs.\n\nIt may be tempting to rescue a snapping turtle found on a road by getting it to bite a stick and then dragging it out of immediate danger. This action can, however, severely scrape the legs and underside of the turtle and lead to deadly infections in the wounds. The safest way to pick up a common snapping turtle is by grasping the carapace above the back legs. There is a large gap above the back legs that allows for easy grasping of the carapace and keeps hands safe from both the beak and claws of the turtle. It can also be picked up with a shovel, from the back, making sure the shovel is square across the bottom of the shell. The easiest way, though, is with a blanket or tarp, picking up the corners with the turtle in the middle.\n\nSnapping turtles are raised on some [[turtle farm]]s in China.<ref>Fang Anning (\u65b9\u5b89\u5b81), \"[http://www.gui138.cn/xinwen/gbxw/201007/765.html \u201c\u5c0f\u5ead\u9662\u201d\u517b\u6b96\u9f9f\u9cd6\u5927\u6709\u8d5a\u5934] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032241/http://www.gui138.cn/xinwen/gbxw/201007/765.html |date=2016-03-04 }}\" (Small-scale turtle farming may be very profitable).

With only three troops of horse to defend against the Royalist cavalry, the Parliamentarians lost over 1000 infantry, and only a few of their cavalry reached the main Parliament army in Leeds.\n\nAn author of the battle, Cavendish's wife, the Duchess of Newcastle, reported over 800 prisoners were captured by the Royalists.

One of the first big songs was [[Johnnie Wright]]'s \"Hello Vietnam,\" a No. 1 hit in October. Late in the year, [[Dave Dudley]] records and releases \"What We're Fighting For,\" an early response to [[opposition to the Vietnam War|the growing number of anti-Vietnam War protests]].\n:The trend continues through the rest of the 1960s and early 1970s, with songs such as \"Distant Drums\" by [[Jim Reeves]]; \"[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]\" by [[Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]]; \"[[Dear Uncle Sam]]\" by [[Loretta Lynn]]; and others. By the late 1960s, the tone of the songs became darker, most notably the [[Mel Tillis]]-penned \"[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town]]\" (first a hit for [[Johnny Darrell]], but more famously in 1969 by [[Kenny Rogers|Kenny Rogers and the First Edition]]).\n* Country singer [[Merle Haggard]] marries fellow country singer and former wife of [[Buck Owens]], [[Bonnie Owens]], they will stay married until their divorce in 1978 but go on to be great friends and Owens will continue to tour with Haggard until her death in 2006.\n* [[Dolly Parton]] signs her first national recording contract with [[Monument Records]]. Initially pitched to the teen market as a bubblegum pop singer, she makes her first ''Billboard'' magazine chart appearance, peaking at No. 8 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] chart in October with a cover of [[The Tune Weavers]]' \"[[Happy, Happy Birthday Baby]].\" A second single, \"Busy Signal\", is released in December but does not reach any of the ''Billboard'' charts. Also during the year, she writes \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", recording both a solo version and backing [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]] on his own version, the latter which became a hit in 1966 and would lead to her being allowed to change her style from pop to country (a reverse of what would happen a decade later, after she had become a superstar).\n* [[Ernest Tubb]] debuts his new weekly TV show, which airs in syndication through 1969, mainly in southern U.S. markets.

music that took place in 1965.\n\n{{YYYY music|1965}}\n{{Year nav topic5|1965|country music}}\n\n==Events==\n* January \u2014 Leo Fender, founder of Fender Guitars, sells his company to a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]] for $13 million.\n* February 17 \u2014 \"[[The Tennessee Waltz]]\" is declared the state song of [[Tennessee]].\n* October \u2014 [[Country Music Association]] president [[Tex Ritter]] awards Leo Fender the President's Award for \"outstanding contributions to the sound of country music.\"\n\n===No dates===\n* The [[Vietnam War]], which by now was making daily headlines, brings about the second wave of patriotic-themed songs. One of the first big songs was [[Johnnie Wright]]'s \"Hello Vietnam,\" a No. 1 hit in October. Late in the year, [[Dave Dudley]] records and releases \"What We're Fighting For,\" an early response to [[opposition to the Vietnam War|the growing number of anti-Vietnam War protests]].\n:The trend continues through the rest of the 1960s and early 1970s, with songs such as \"Distant Drums\" by [[Jim Reeves]]; \"[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]\" by [[Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]]; \"[[Dear Uncle Sam]]\" by [[Loretta Lynn]]; and others. By the late 1960s, the tone of the songs became darker, most notably the [[Mel Tillis]]-penned \"[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town]]\" (first a hit for [[Johnny Darrell]], but more famously in 1969 by [[Kenny Rogers|Kenny Rogers and the First Edition]]).\n* Country singer [[Merle Haggard]] marries fellow country singer and former wife of [[Buck Owens]], [[Bonnie Owens]], they will stay married until their divorce in 1978 but go on to be great friends and Owens will continue to tour with Haggard until her death in 2006.\n* [[Dolly Parton]] signs her first national recording contract with [[Monument Records]]. Initially pitched to the teen market as a bubblegum pop singer, she makes her first ''Billboard'' magazine chart appearance, peaking at No. 8 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] chart in October with a cover of [[The Tune Weavers]]' \"[[Happy, Happy Birthday Baby]].\" A second single, \"Busy Signal\", is released in December but does not reach any of the ''Billboard'' charts. Also during the year, she writes \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", recording both a solo version and backing [[Bill Phillips (singer)|Bill Phillips]] on his own version, the latter which became a hit in 1966 and would lead to her being allowed to change her style from pop to country (a reverse of what would happen a decade later, after she had become a superstar).\n* [[Ernest Tubb]] debuts his new weekly TV show, which airs in syndication through 1969, mainly in southern U.S. markets. The show features his backing band the Texas Troubadours, and regular vocalists [[Jack Greene]] and [[Cal Smith]].\n\n==Top hits of the year==\n\n===Number one hits===\n\n====United States====\n''(as certified by [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]])''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- style=\"background:#FF3333\"\n!Date\n!Single Name\n!Artist\n!width=\"40\"|Wks.
