However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its [[History of the United States Congress|first session]] of the [[United States Congress]] with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] prematurely, at the urging of President [[John Adams]], in hopes of securing enough [[Southern United States|Southern]] votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to be re-elected for a second term as President.<ref name=\"carter-p139\">{{cite journal | author=Carter II, Edward C. | title=Benjamin Henry Latrobe and the Growth and Development of Washington, 1798\u20131818 | journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society | date=1971\u20131972 | page=139}}</ref>\n\n===Early religious use===\nFor several decades, beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions. The first services were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven\", which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Then, from 1807 to 1857, they were held in the then-House Chamber (now called [[Statuary Hall]]). When held in the House chamber, the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. According to the [[U.S. Library of Congress]] exhibit ''Religion and the Founding of the American Republic'':\n\n{{Quote|It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1801\u20131809) and of [[James Madison]] (1809\u20131817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

Worship services in the House\u2014a practice that continued until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]\u2014were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary.

[[George Bomford]] and [[Joseph Gardner Swift]], both military engineers, were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol. Reconstruction began in 1815 and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings (now sides), which were completed by 1819. During the reconstruction, Congress met in the [[Old Brick Capitol]], a temporary structure financed by local investors. Construction continued through to 1826, with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]], rising above the first low dome of the Capitol. Latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features; his successor, Bulfinch, also played a major role, such as the design of the first low dome covered in copper.\n\n===The House and Senate Wings===\n[[File:Capitol1846.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daguerreotype]] of east side of the Capitol in 1846, by [[John Plumbe]]]]\n\nBy 1850, it became clear that the Capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states. A new design competition was held, and President [[Millard Fillmore]] appointed Philadelphia architect [[Thomas U. Walter]] to carry out the expansion.

Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building.

Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives. It is an example of the [[neoclassical architecture]] style.\n\nTunnels and internal [[United States Capitol Subway System|subways]] connect the Capitol building with the [[Congressional office buildings]] in the [[United States Capitol Complex|Capitol Complex]].

The murals, known as the [[Brumidi Corridors]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/brumidi/index.cfm | title=AOC.gov | publisher=AOC.gov | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> reflect great moments and people in [[History of the United States|United States history]]. Among the original works are those depicting [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], [[Robert Fulton]], and events such as the [[Louisiana Purchase|Cession of Louisiana]]. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural [[Flora of the United States|flora]] indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Apollo 11|Moon landing]], and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' crew]].\n\nBrumidi also worked within the Rotunda. He is responsible for the painting of ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' beneath the top of the dome, and also the famous ''[[United States Capitol rotunda#Frieze of American History|Frieze of American History]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/rotunda/frieze/index.cfm | title=Frieze of American History | publisher=Aoc.gov | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> ''The Apotheosis of Washington'' was completed in 11 months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly {{convert|180|ft}} in the air. It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]]. Washington is depicted surrounded by 13 [[Virginity|maidens]] in an inner ring with many [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman gods and goddesses]] below him in a second ring. The [[frieze]] is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological, pictorial history of the United States from the landing of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[Wright Brothers]]'s flight in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], [[North Carolina]]. The frieze was started in 1878 and was not completed until 1953. The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists: Brumidi, [[Filippo Costaggini]], [[Charles Ayer Whipple]], and [[Allyn Cox]]. The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his ''Frieze of the United States History''.\n\n[[File:USCapitolRotunda.JPG|thumb|left|[[United States Capitol rotunda|Capitol Rotunda]] (2005 view)]]\n\nWithin the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation. On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America. On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States. The east side paintings include ''The Baptism of [[Pocahontas]]'' by [[John Gadsby Chapman]], ''The Embarkation of the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]]'' by [[Robert Walter Weir]], ''The Discovery of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]'' by [[William Henry Powell]], and ''The Landing of Columbus'' by [[John Vanderlyn]]. The paintings on the west side are by [[John Trumbull]]: ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', ''[[Surrender of General Burgoyne]]'', ''[[Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]]'', and ''[[General George Washington Resigning His Commission]]''. Trumbull was a contemporary of the United States' founding fathers and a participant in the [[American Revolutionary War]]; he painted a self-portrait into ''Surrender of Lord Cornwallis''.\n\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819), by [[John Trumbull]]]]\n\n''[[First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln]]'', an 1864 painting by [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]], hangs over the west staircase in the Senate wing.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Painting_33_00005.htm | title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home, First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of Presid | publisher=Senate.gov | accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:National Statuary Hall Collection.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Statuary Hall Collection]] viewed from the south]]\n\nThe Capitol also houses the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], comprising two statues donated by each of the [[U.S. state|fifty states]] to honor persons notable in their histories. One of the most notable statues in the [[National Statuary Hall]] is a [[Kamehameha Statue|bronze statue of King Kamehameha]] donated by the state of Hawaii upon its accession to the union in 1959. The statue's extraordinary weight of {{convert|15,000|lb|kg}} raised concerns that it might come crashing through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of [[Pop\u00e9|Po'pay]] from the state of [[New Mexico]], was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.\n\n===Crypt===\n[[File:USA-US Capitol2.JPG|thumb|left|Capitol Crypt]]\n\nOn the ground floor is an area known as [[United States Capitol crypt|the Crypt]]. It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed [[balustrade]] at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last [[Will (law)|will]], Washington was buried at [[Mount Vernon]]. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A [[Compass rose|compass star]] inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C. is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how [[Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.|addresses in Washington, D.C.]], are designated ([[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|NE]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]], [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|SE]], or [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|SW]]).\n\nWithin the Crypt is [[Gutzon Borglum]]'s massive ''Abraham Lincoln Bust''. The sculptor had a fascination with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of [[marble]]. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer, Jr.]], and accepted by the [[Joint Committee on the Library]], in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt.<ref name=\"Abraham Lincoln Bust\">{{cite web|title=Abraham Lincoln Bust|url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/busts/abraham-lincoln-bust|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Borglum was a patriot; believing that the \"monuments we have built are not our own\", he looked to create art that was \"American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement\", according to a 1908 interview article.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], the president's son, praised the bust as \"the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen\".<ref name=\"Abraham Lincoln Bust\"/> Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing the left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|unfinished life]].\n\n===Features===\nAt one end of the room near the [[Old Supreme Court Chamber]] is a statue of [[John C. Calhoun]]. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1998)|1998 shooting incident]] is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\n\nTwelve presidents have [[Lying in state|lain in state]] in the Rotunda for public viewing, most recently [[George H. W. Bush]]. The tomb meant for Washington stored the [[catafalque]] which is used to support [[coffin]]s lying in state or honor in the Capitol. The catafalque now on display in the Exhibition Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center was used for President Lincoln.\n\nThe [[Hall of Columns]] is located on the House side of the Capitol, home to twenty-eight fluted columns and statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection. In the basement of the Capitol building in a utility room are two marble bathtubs, which are all that remain of the once elaborate Senate baths. These baths were a [[spa]]-like facility designed for members of Congress and their guests before many buildings in the city had modern plumbing. The facilities included several bathtubs, a barbershop, and a [[massage parlor]].\n\nA steep, metal staircase, totaling 365 steps, leads from the basement to an outdoor walkway on top of the Capitol's dome.<ref name=365steps>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/10/us/365-steps-to-the-top-of-capitol-hill.html | title= 365 Steps to the Top of Capitol Hill | date= August 10, 1997 | work=The New York Times | at= Section 1, Page 22 | accessdate=August 9, 2009 }}</ref> The number of steps represents each day of the year.<ref name=thirtyyears>{{cite book | last= Logan | first= Mrs. John A.

Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including ''[[The Rescue (statue)|The Rescue]]'' and ''[[George Washington (Greenough)|George Washington]]''. The current grounds were designed by noted American [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, as one of his first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the [[marble]] [[Terrace garden|terraces]] on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.\n\nOlmsted also designed the Summerhouse, the open-air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol. Three [[arch]]es open into the [[hexagon]]al structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial [[grotto]]. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summerhouse was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern [[drinking fountain]]s have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summerhouse on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-grounds/summerhouse\n|title=Summerhouse\n|website=Architect of the Capitol\n|access-date=2019-08-20\n}}</ref>\n\n===Flags===\nUp to four [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flags]] can be seen flying over the Capitol.

The other two flagpoles are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by [[United States House of Representatives Page|House pages]]. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Senate Sergeant at Arms]]'s office.

It is located on [[Capitol Hill]] at the eastern end of the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Though no longer at the geographic center of the [[Geography of Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.| District's four quadrants]].\n\nThe original building was completed in 1800. Although the Capitol was temporarily rendered unusable as a consequence of the 1814 [[burning of Washington]], the building was fully restored within five years. The building was later expanded, particularly with the addition of a massive [[United States Capitol dome|dome]], and expanded chambers for the [[bicameral]] legislature, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the south wing and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as ''fronts'', though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.\n\n==History==\n[[File:US Capitol east side.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The east front of the United States Capitol (2013 view)]]\n[[File:Capitol at Dusk 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The east front at night (2013 view)]]\n\n===Background===\n{{See also|History of Washington, D.C.|List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.|List of capitals in the United States#Capitals of the United States}}\n\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the [[United States Congress]] and its predecessors had met in [[Philadelphia]] ([[Independence Hall]] and [[Congress Hall]]), New York City ([[Federal Hall]]), and a number of other locations ([[York, Pennsylvania]]; [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]; the [[Maryland State House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]; and [[Nassau Hall]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]).<ref>See [[List of capitals in the United States]]</ref> In September 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] brought together delegates from the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] in Philadelphia, followed by the [[Second Continental Congress]], which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\nAfter adopting the [[Articles of Confederation]] in [[York, Pennsylvania]], the [[Congress of the Confederation]] was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]], demanding payment for their service during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Congress requested that [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], call up the [[Militia (United States)|militia]] to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]], Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia.

The decision of where to locate the capital was contentious, but [[Alexander Hamilton]] helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from [[Northeastern United States|northern states]] for locating the capital along the [[Potomac River]]. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.<ref>Allen (2001), p. 4\u20137</ref>\n\n[[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]] was given the task of creating the city plan for the new capital city.<ref>L'Enfant identified himself as \"Peter Charles L'Enfant\" during most of his life, while residing in the United States.

Despite the wishes of Jefferson and the President, Hallet went ahead anyway and modified Thornton's design for the East Front and created a square central court that projected from the center, with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies.

However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its [[History of the United States Congress|first session]] of the [[United States Congress]] with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] prematurely, at the urging of President [[John Adams]], in hopes of securing enough [[Southern United States|Southern]] votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to be re-elected for a second term as President.<ref name=\"carter-p139\">{{cite journal | author=Carter II, Edward C. | title=Benjamin Henry Latrobe and the Growth and Development of Washington, 1798\u20131818 | journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society | date=1971\u20131972 | page=139}}</ref>\n\n===Early religious use===\nFor several decades, beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions. The first services were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven\", which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Then, from 1807 to 1857, they were held in the then-House Chamber (now called [[Statuary Hall]]). When held in the House chamber, the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. According to the [[U.S. Library of Congress]] exhibit ''Religion and the Founding of the American Republic'':\n\n{{Quote|It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1801\u20131809) and of [[James Madison]] (1809\u20131817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House\u2014a practice that continued until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]\u2014were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.)

[[George Bomford]] and [[Joseph Gardner Swift]], both military engineers, were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol. Reconstruction began in 1815 and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings (now sides), which were completed by 1819. During the reconstruction, Congress met in the [[Old Brick Capitol]], a temporary structure financed by local investors. Construction continued through to 1826, with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]], rising above the first low dome of the Capitol.

In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the \"[[wedding-cake style]]\" cast-iron dome that stands today. Also designed by [[Thomas U. Walter]], the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and {{convert|100|ft}} in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers. Like [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart|Mansart]]'s dome at \"[[Les Invalides]]\" (which he had visited in 1838), Walter's dome is double, with a large [[oculus]] in the inner dome, through which is seen ''\"[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]\"'' painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs, which also support the visible exterior structure and the [[wikt:tholos|tholos]] that supports The \"[[Statue of Freedom]]\", a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in 1863.

The murals, known as the [[Brumidi Corridors]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/brumidi/index.cfm | title=AOC.gov | publisher=AOC.gov | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> reflect great moments and people in [[History of the United States|United States history]].

Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural [[Flora of the United States|flora]] indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Apollo 11|Moon landing]], and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' crew]].\n\nBrumidi also worked within the Rotunda. He is responsible for the painting of ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' beneath the top of the dome, and also the famous ''[[United States Capitol rotunda#Frieze of American History|Frieze of American History]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/rotunda/frieze/index.cfm | title=Frieze of American History | publisher=Aoc.gov | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> ''The Apotheosis of Washington'' was completed in 11 months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly {{convert|180|ft}} in the air. It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]]. Washington is depicted surrounded by 13 [[Virginity|maidens]] in an inner ring with many [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman gods and goddesses]] below him in a second ring. The [[frieze]] is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological, pictorial history of the United States from the landing of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[Wright Brothers]]'s flight in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], [[North Carolina]]. The frieze was started in 1878 and was not completed until 1953. The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists: Brumidi, [[Filippo Costaggini]], [[Charles Ayer Whipple]], and [[Allyn Cox]]. The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his ''Frieze of the United States History''.\n\n[[File:USCapitolRotunda.JPG|thumb|left|[[United States Capitol rotunda|Capitol Rotunda]] (2005 view)]]\n\nWithin the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation. On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America. On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States.

It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed [[balustrade]] at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last [[Will (law)|will]], Washington was buried at [[Mount Vernon]]. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A [[Compass rose|compass star]] inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C. is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how [[Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.|addresses in Washington, D.C.]], are designated ([[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|NE]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]], [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|SE]], or [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|SW]]).\n\nWithin the Crypt is [[Gutzon Borglum]]'s massive ''Abraham Lincoln Bust''. The sculptor had a fascination with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of [[marble]]. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer, Jr.]], and accepted by the [[Joint Committee on the Library]], in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt.<ref name=\"Abraham Lincoln Bust\">{{cite web|title=Abraham Lincoln Bust|url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/busts/abraham-lincoln-bust|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Borglum was a patriot; believing that the \"monuments we have built are not our own\", he looked to create art that was \"American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement\", according to a 1908 interview article.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], the president's son, praised the bust as \"the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen\".<ref name=\"Abraham Lincoln Bust\"/> Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing the left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|unfinished life]].\n\n===Features===\nAt one end of the room near the [[Old Supreme Court Chamber]] is a statue of [[John C.

The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\n\nTwelve presidents have [[Lying in state|lain in state]] in the Rotunda for public viewing, most recently [[George H.

Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including ''[[The Rescue (statue)|The Rescue]]'' and ''[[George Washington (Greenough)|George Washington]]''. The current grounds were designed by noted American [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, as one of his first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the [[marble]] [[Terrace garden|terraces]] on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.\n\nOlmsted also designed the Summerhouse, the open-air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol. Three [[arch]]es open into the [[hexagon]]al structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial [[grotto]]. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summerhouse was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern [[drinking fountain]]s have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summerhouse on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-grounds/summerhouse\n|title=Summerhouse\n|website=Architect of the Capitol\n|access-date=2019-08-20\n}}</ref>\n\n===Flags===\nUp to four [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flags]] can be seen flying over the Capitol.

The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by [[United States House of Representatives Page|House pages]]. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Senate Sergeant at Arms]]'s office.

Doyle|DE-368|6}}, during [[World War II]] which helped to save 317 lives during the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} tragedy. Over 30 years later, Claytor's moderate actions on behalf of the rights of [[Women in the United States Navy|female]] and [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|gay]] service personnel as [[Secretary of the Navy]] were considered progressive for the time. He is also credited with a distinguished transportation career, including ten years as president of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] and 11 years as the head of [[Amtrak]], guiding the passenger railroad through a particularly difficult period in its history. He was named the Virginian of the Year in 1977.<ref name=\"viriginayera\"/>\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nClaytor was born in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] on March 14, 1912, and grew up in both [[Virginia]] and [[Philadelphia]]. He was the son of [[Gertrude Harris Boatwright Claytor]], a lyric poet, and [[W. Graham Claytor]] (1886\u20131971), who was vice-president of [[Appalachian Power]].\n\nClaytor graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in 1933. He then graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1936. He then clerked for [[Learned Hand]], Judge of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. He then moved to Washington, D.C., to become law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] before joining the prestigious [[Washington, DC|Washington]] law firm [[Covington and Burling]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===World War II \u2014 USS ''Indianapolis'' tragedy===\n\nIn 1940, soon after the start of [[World War II]], 28-year-old Claytor attempted to enlist, but was initially rejected by the [[United States Navy]] as being too old.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He finally joined under a special provision, based upon his previous experience in sports boating. He was assigned to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]].\n\nLate in the war, Claytor became commanding officer of the destroyer escort {{USS|Cecil J. Doyle|DE-368|6}} on patrol in the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name=\"proceedings\">Marks (April 1981), pp. 48\u201350.</ref> In August 1945, Claytor sped without orders {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} to investigate reports of men floating in the water. As ''Cecil J. Doyle'' approached the area at night, Claytor turned the ship's searchlights on the water and straight up on low clouds, lighting up the night, despite the risk of exposing his ship to possible attack by Japanese submarines.<ref name=\"proceedings\"/> These actions facilitated the rescue of the survivors of the sunken [[cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.<ref name=\"proceedings\"/>\n\n''Indianapolis'' had been on a secret mission, and due to a communications error, had not been reported as overdue (or missing). An estimated 900 men survived the sinking, but spent days floating in life jackets trying to fight off sharks. While only 317 were rescued out of a crew of 1199 who were aboard ''Indianapolis'', Claytor's actions were widely credited by survivors with preventing an even greater loss of life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Legal practice and Southern Railway===\n{{See also|Southern Railway (US)}}\nAfter World War II, he resumed practice of law in Washington, D.C. He became an officer of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] in 1963, serving as president from 1967\u20131977. Notwithstanding his legal background, Claytor was known as an \"operations\" man, often riding the company's trains, monitoring and questioning performance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In contrast to his predecessor, [[D. William Brosnan]], Claytor was an \"employee's President,\" often chatting with the crews of the trains on which he rode, actively soliciting their suggestions on how to make the railroad run better. He carried this attitude with him during his later service as the President of Amtrak.\n\n===U.S. Government service===\n{{See also|Secretary of the Navy}}\nClaytor served as the [[Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]] from 1977<ref name=\"csm-shutt1\">{{cite news | first = Anne | last = Shutt | title = In Short\u2026 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0611/061125.html | work = Christian Science Monitor | publisher = [[First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston|First Church of Christ, Scientist]] | location = [[Boston, Massachusetts]] | date = 1982-06-11 | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref> to 1979.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} He is credited with leading the [[United States Navy]] into its first recognition of [[Equal opportunity|women's right to serve on ships]] and of [[gay rights|rights of gays]] to leave the service without criminal records. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} His positions were considered by activists to be progressive for the time, leading to further progress years later in these controversial issues.\n\nIn 1979, he was appointed to the position of [[Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} While serving as Deputy Defense Secretary, Claytor's military assistant was General [[Colin Powell]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nIn the summer of 1979, he took a brief leave from the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to serve as [[Secretary of Transportation|Acting Secretary of Transportation]] in Carter's Cabinet. His service at the Transportation Department bridged the tenures of Secretary [[Brock Adams]] and Secretary [[Neil Goldschmidt]].\n\n===Amtrak===\n{{See also|Amtrak}}\nIn 1982, Claytor came out of retirement to lead [[Amtrak]]. He was recruited and strongly supported by [[John H. Riley]], an attorney who was also the head of the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) under the [[Ronald W. Reagan|Reagan Administration]] from 1983 to 1989.\n\nClaytor maintained a good relationship with the [[U.S. Congress]] during his 11 years in the position. Within 7 years of being under Claytor's leadership, Amtrak was generating enough money to cover 72 percent of its $1.7 billion operating budget by 1989, up from 48 percent in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alpert |first1=Mark |date=1989-10-23 |title=Still Chugging |journal=Fortune |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/10/23/72601/index.htm |accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref> This was achieved mainly through vigorous cost cutting and aggressive marketing. He is credited with bringing political and operational stability to the nation's passenger train network, keeping the railroad functioning properly despite repeated attempts by the administrations of Reagan and his successor [[George H.W.

Doyle|DE-368|6}}, during [[World War II]] which helped to save 317 lives during the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} tragedy. Over 30 years later, Claytor's moderate actions on behalf of the rights of [[Women in the United States Navy|female]] and [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|gay]] service personnel as [[Secretary of the Navy]] were considered progressive for the time. He is also credited with a distinguished transportation career, including ten years as president of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] and 11 years as the head of [[Amtrak]], guiding the passenger railroad through a particularly difficult period in its history. He was named the Virginian of the Year in 1977.<ref name=\"viriginayera\"/>\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nClaytor was born in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] on March 14, 1912, and grew up in both [[Virginia]] and [[Philadelphia]]. He was the son of [[Gertrude Harris Boatwright Claytor]], a lyric poet, and [[W. Graham Claytor]] (1886\u20131971), who was vice-president of [[Appalachian Power]].\n\nClaytor graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in 1933. He then graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1936. He then clerked for [[Learned Hand]], Judge of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. He then moved to Washington, D.C., to become law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] before joining the prestigious [[Washington, DC|Washington]] law firm [[Covington and Burling]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===World War II \u2014 USS ''Indianapolis'' tragedy===\n\nIn 1940, soon after the start of [[World War II]], 28-year-old Claytor attempted to enlist, but was initially rejected by the [[United States Navy]] as being too old.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He finally joined under a special provision, based upon his previous experience in sports boating. He was assigned to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]].\n\nLate in the war, Claytor became commanding officer of the destroyer escort {{USS|Cecil J. Doyle|DE-368|6}} on patrol in the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name=\"proceedings\">Marks (April 1981), pp. 48\u201350.</ref> In August 1945, Claytor sped without orders {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} to investigate reports of men floating in the water. As ''Cecil J. Doyle'' approached the area at night, Claytor turned the ship's searchlights on the water and straight up on low clouds, lighting up the night, despite the risk of exposing his ship to possible attack by Japanese submarines.<ref name=\"proceedings\"/> These actions facilitated the rescue of the survivors of the sunken [[cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.<ref name=\"proceedings\"/>\n\n''Indianapolis'' had been on a secret mission, and due to a communications error, had not been reported as overdue (or missing). An estimated 900 men survived the sinking, but spent days floating in life jackets trying to fight off sharks. While only 317 were rescued out of a crew of 1199 who were aboard ''Indianapolis'', Claytor's actions were widely credited by survivors with preventing an even greater loss of life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Legal practice and Southern Railway===\n{{See also|Southern Railway (US)}}\nAfter World War II, he resumed practice of law in Washington DC. He became an officer of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] in 1963, serving as president from 1967\u20131977. Notwithstanding his legal background, Claytor was known as an \"operations\" man, often riding the company's trains, monitoring and questioning performance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In contrast to his predecessor, [[D. William Brosnan]], Mr. Claytor was an \"employee's President,\" often chatting with the crews of the trains on which he rode, actively soliciting their suggestions on how to make the railroad run better. He carried this attitude with him during his later service as the President of Amtrak.\n\n===U.S. Government service===\n{{See also|Secretary of the Navy}}\nClaytor served as the [[Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]] from 1977<ref name=\"csm-shutt1\">{{cite news | first = Anne | last = Shutt | title = In Short\u2026 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0611/061125.html | work = Christian Science Monitor | publisher = [[First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston|First Church of Christ, Scientist]] | location = [[Boston, Massachusetts]] | date = 1982-06-11 | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref> to 1979.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} He is credited with leading the [[United States Navy]] into its first recognition of [[Equal opportunity|women's right to serve on ships]] and of [[gay rights|rights of gays]] to leave the service without criminal records. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} His positions were considered by activists to be progressive for the time, leading to further progress years later in these controversial issues.\n\nIn 1979, he was appointed to the position of [[Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} While serving as Deputy Defense Secretary, Claytor's military assistant was General [[Colin Powell]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nIn the summer of 1979, he took a brief leave from the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to serve as [[Secretary of Transportation|Acting Secretary of Transportation]] in Carter's Cabinet. His service at the Transportation Department bridged the tenures of Secretary [[Brock Adams]] and Secretary [[Neil Goldschmidt]].\n\n===Amtrak===\n{{See also|Amtrak}}\nIn 1982, Claytor came out of retirement to lead [[Amtrak]]. He was recruited and strongly supported by [[John H. Riley]], an attorney who was also the head of the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) under the [[Ronald W. Reagan|Reagan Administration]] from 1983 to 1989.\n\nClaytor maintained a good relationship with the [[U.S. Congress]] during his 11 years in the position. Within 7 years of being under Claytor's leadership, Amtrak was generating enough money to cover 72 percent of its $1.7 billion operating budget by 1989, up from 48 percent in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alpert |first1=Mark |date=1989-10-23 |title=Still Chugging |journal=Fortune |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/10/23/72601/index.htm |accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref> This was achieved mainly through vigorous cost cutting and aggressive marketing. He is credited with bringing political and operational stability to the nation's passenger train network, keeping the railroad functioning properly despite repeated attempts by the administrations of Reagan and his successor [[George H.W.

As the small fires spread, a large crowd of local people, including several local politicians and senior railway officials, gathered to watch the emergency operation.\n\n==Explosion==\n\nDuring the cleanup operation, the cargo of the wagons exploded - reportedly at the equivalent of 180 tons of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]<ref name=\":1\" /> - demolishing Khayyam, badly damaging the nearby towns of [[Eyshabad, Nishapur|Eyshabad]], [[Dehnow, Nishapur|Dehnow]] and [[Taqiabad, Nishapur|Taqiabad]], and being felt in the city of [[Mashhad]], 70 kilometers away.

As the small fires spread, a large crowd of local people, including several local politicians and senior railway officials, gathered to watch the emergency operation.\n\n==Explosion==\n\nDuring the cleanup operation, the cargo of the wagons exploded - reportedly at the equivalent of 180 tons of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]<ref name=\":1\" /> - demolishing Khayyam, badly damaging the nearby towns of [[Eyshabad, Nishapur|Eyshabad]], [[Dehnow, Nishapur|Dehnow]] and [[Taqiabad, Nishapur|Taqiabad]], and being felt in the city of [[Mashhad]], 70 kilometers away. The entire village was destroyed, and all of the local emergency services and government personnel were killed or seriously injured in the blast. The wreckage of the train and village continued to burn and explode for several days, despite the cold weather.\n\n==Death toll==\n\nState authorities identified 295 confirmed killed and over 460 injured, including 182 rescue workers and state officials.\n\n==Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps==\nFollowing the blast, troops from the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] were called in and were able to maintain security, whilst hundreds of rescue workers were brought in to help with the injured, the trapped, the missing and the dead.{{Citation Needed|date=September 2011}} Four villages were later described as \"totally destroyed\".{{Citation Needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Cause==\n\nInitial reports that \"earth tremors\"<ref name=\":0\" /> started the wagons rolling have since been discredited, and a thorough investigation has so far failed to discover how exactly the wagons were able to travel from Nishapur to Khayyam on their own, why so many highly flammable cargoes were stored and transported together, and why the details of the crash weren't discovered sooner, perhaps in time to arrange an evacuation.

In December 2009, Eastmond signed a new two-year contract with St Helens that ended at the end of the 2011 Super League season.\n\n===2010-11===\nAfter [[Sean Long]] left [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] to join [[Hull F.C.]] at the end of the 2009 season, Kyle became the new number 7 for Saints. He started the year very well before injuries hit him for the 2nd half of the season. Although he still managed to make 19 appearances scoring 15 tries. He scored 63 goal kicks missing 18, and kicked 2 drop goals. He made a total of 1615m. Every time he came back from injury he seem to aggravate it. Therefore, meaning he missed the [[2010 Super League Grand Final|Grand Final]] defeat by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. [[Matty Smith]], now of [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], returned from his loan spell at Salford for the play-offs and featured in the final.\n\nIn early 2011 Eastmond was linked with a move to [[Rugby Union]]. Kyle started the season poorly and with fans getting on his back. However, on 28 February 2011 both the club and coach [[Royce Simmons]], confirmed he was to leave Saints. It was revealed that Kyle had signed a three-year deal with [[Bath Rugby]], Eastmond has promised to be 100% committed to his current club for the rest of the season.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A81958594\n|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|date=2011-02-28|accessdate=2011-02-28|title=Comfrimed: Eastond to Bath Rugby Union}}</ref> Commenting on the move, Bath Director of Rugby [[Ian McGeechan|Sir Ian McGeechan]] said he envisions Eastmond playing at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]].\n\nOn 16 March 2011 it was announced on the [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] website that he had been suspended by the club pending an investigation into serious misconduct. The club also said that no further comments will be made until the completion of the investigation. It was confirmed by the club that he made an inappropriate gesture to his home fans, and it looked unlikely he would ever play in the red V again, especially after the emergence of scrum-half sensation [[Jonny Lomax]], and stand-off [[Lee Gaskell]]. He was dropped to the under-18s team. However injuries struck Saints, and they called upon Kyle to fill in. He was playing under difficult circumstances, with Saints fans booing him with every touch of the ball, however he made a decent return. In July 2011 he successfully made the switch from the halfbacks to fullback, scoring 2 tries against [[Wakefield Trinity]] on 9 July. Since then Kyle has regained his confidence and is playing in a similar way to the 2008-09 seasons. He has so far managed 15 appearances and scored 5 tries, but reduced to just 4 goal kicks (3 missed kicks) due to [[Jamie Foster]] replacing him as the club's kicker.\n\n==Rugby Union career==\n\n===Bath===\nKyle joined Bath, when he moved in October 2011, after his contract finished at Saints. At Bath he played well and picked up Rugby Union quickly meaning that in 2013, Kyle was selected to play for the England Saxons. During the 13/14 season, Eastmond formed a crucial partnership with George Ford, which led to Baths resurgence to the top of Aviva Premiership, he would then get selected for the main England side in the 2014 Autumn internationals but missed out on selection to England's World Cup squad to then Bath Club colleague Sam Burgess.\n\n===Wasps===\nAfter a poor season by the whole team after the World Cup he left Bath to join Wasps who were emerging as top team and had bought a new stadium in the Ricoh Arena, Coventry. His period with Wasps was blighted by injury, and resultantly playing second-choice often from the bench to other more reliable players.\n\n===Leicester===\nOn 1 August 2018 Leicester Tigers announced the signing of Eastmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/45030592|title=Kyle Eastmond: Leicester sign utility back|date=1 August 2018|accessdate=1 August 2018|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n===England===\nEastmond was selected in the [[England national rugby union team|England]] squad to tour America in the summer of 2013.

In December 2009, Eastmond signed a new two-year contract with St Helens that ended at the end of the 2011 Super League season.\n\n===2010-11===\nAfter [[Sean Long]] left [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] to join [[Hull F.C.]] at the end of the 2009 season, Kyle became the new number 7 for Saints. He started the year very well before injuries hit him for the 2nd half of the season. Although he still managed to make 19 appearances scoring 15 tries. He scored 63 goal kicks missing 18, and kicked 2 drop goals. He made a total of 1615m. Every time he came back from injury he seem to aggravate it. Therefore, meaning he missed the [[2010 Super League Grand Final|Grand Final]] defeat by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. [[Matty Smith]], now of [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], returned from his loan spell at Salford for the play-offs and featured in the final.\n\nIn early 2011 Eastmond was linked with a move to [[Rugby Union]]. Kyle started the season poorly and with fans getting on his back. However, on 28 February 2011 both the club and coach [[Royce Simmons]], confirmed he was to leave Saints. It was revealed that Kyle had signed a three-year deal with [[Bath Rugby]], Eastmond has promised to be 100% committed to his current club for the rest of the season.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A81958594\n|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|date=2011-02-28|accessdate=2011-02-28|title=Comfrimed: Eastond to Bath Rugby Union}}</ref> Commenting on the move, Bath Director of Rugby [[Ian McGeechan|Sir Ian McGeechan]] said he envisions Eastmond playing at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]].\n\nOn 16 March 2011 it was announced on the [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] website that he had been suspended by the club pending an investigation into serious misconduct. The club also said that no further comments will be made until the completion of the investigation. It was confirmed by the club that he made an inappropriate gesture to his home fans, and it looked unlikely he would ever play in the red V again, especially after the emergence of scrum-half sensation [[Jonny Lomax]], and stand-off [[Lee Gaskell]]. He was dropped to the under-18s team. However injuries struck Saints, and they called upon Kyle to fill in. He was playing under difficult circumstances, with Saints fans booing him with every touch of the ball, however he made a decent return. In July 2011 he successfully made the switch from the halfbacks to fullback, scoring 2 tries against [[Wakefield Trinity]] on 9 July. Since then Kyle has regained his confidence and is playing in a similar way to the 2008-09 seasons. He has so far managed 15 appearances and scored 5 tries, but reduced to just 4 goal kicks (3 missed kicks) due to [[Jamie Foster]] replacing him as the club's kicker.\n\n==Rugby Union career==\n\n===Bath===\nKyle joined Bath, when he moved in October 2011, after his contract finished at Saints. At Bath he played well and picked up Rugby Union quickly meaning that in 2013, Kyle was selected to play for the England Saxons. During the 13/14 season, Eastmond formed a crucial partnership with George Ford, which led to Baths resurgence to the top of Aviva Premiership, he would then get selected for the main England side in the 2014 Autumn internationals but missed out on selection to England's World Cup squad to then Bath Club colleague Sam Burgess.\n\n===Wasps===\nAfter a poor season by the whole team after the World Cup he left Bath to join Wasps who were emerging as top team and had bought a new stadium in the Ricoh Arena, Coventry. His period with Wasps was blighted by injury, and resultantly playing second-choice often from the bench to other more reliable players.\n\n===Leicester===\nOn 1 August 2018 Leicester Tigers announced the signing of Eastmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/45030592|title=Kyle Eastmond: Leicester sign utility back|date=1 August 2018|accessdate=1 August 2018|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n===England===\nEastmond was selected in the [[England national rugby union team|England]] squad to tour America in the summer of 2013.
