Before formation of the brigade, there were no official 'AA formations' on [[Gibraltar]], but this shortly changed following the [[Battle of France]].  The brigade continued to serve as the prime AA defence formation until it was disbanded in 1944.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|252x252px|3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar|alt=|left]]\n=== Background ===\nOn the outbreak of war in September 1939 there had only been two batteries (9 and 19 AA Btys) manning the totally inadequate AA defences of Gibraltar, which consisted of four old 3-inch guns and four new 3.7-inch guns, spread in two-gun sections to give the widest possible coverage, and two of the new Bofors 40 mm guns to protect the [[Gibdock|Royal Navy Dockyard]], with the assistance of [[Royal Navy]] (RN) [[QF 2-pounder naval gun#QF%202-pounder%20Mark%20VIII|2-pounder pom-pom guns]]. [[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th AA Rgt]] was formed in December 1939 to command 9 and 19 AA Btys and train the AA Section of the new [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] (GDF), which took over the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the '[[Phoney war]]' period.<ref>Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\":0\">Routledge, pp. 200-4.</ref><ref name=\"RA39\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|title=10 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218082653/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1939.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1939)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_army/gibraltar.html|title=Gibraltar, 3 September 1939|last=|first=|date=4 December 2012|website=niehorster.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]], a group of AA detachments under [[53rd (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|53rd (City of London) AA Rgt]] escaped from [[Marseilles]] aboard the SS ''Alma Dawson''. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived on 27 June, and once it had unloaded its guns and equipment 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940\u201341, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], file WO 166/2343.</ref><ref name=\"Joslen552\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\nThere followed a reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, together with the GDF HAA battery, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gunsites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. 10th AA Rgt HQ was ordered to be transferred to [[Malta]] in July, but this did not occur until November when, as part of [[Operation Coat]], a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar and picked it up.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the [[Vichy French Air Force]] in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] on 3 July ([[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|Operation Catapult]]), which had been carried out by [[Force H]] from Gibraltar. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] bomber during a raid by the Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]''. On 24 and 25 September waves of Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and [[Free France|Free French]] attack on [[Dakar]] ([[Battle of Dakar|Operation Menace]]), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. On other occasions the guns fired at single Italian reconnaissance aircraft, known to the garrison as 'Persistent Percy'.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130\u201337, 142.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 1\u20137.</ref><ref>Smith, pp. 57\u201388.</ref><ref name=\"Farn200\">Farndale, pp. 200\u20131.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 295\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDuring to the increase of raids and the coming [[North African Campaign]], the [[War Office]] (WO) approved the formation of a new AA Brigade which would handle the increasing demands brought on CRA, Gibraltar.  This new formation was to be known as the '''15th Anti-Aircraft Brigade''' (15th AA Bde) which was to take over all AA matters on the rock.  On 2 September 1941 the brigade was constituted with HQ based at [[RAF Gibraltar]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">Frederick, p. 1049.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1942.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1942)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>[[File:Gibraltar during the Second World War GM4392.jpg|thumb|The [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] training on a 3.7-inch gun.]]\nThe brigade was then organised as;<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Routledge, Table XXXIV: Page 212.</ref>\n\n* Brigade Headquarters under [[Brigadier]] [[Duncan Learmonth|Duncan Alexander Learmonth]]<ref group=\"Notes\">Assigned directly by the Governor of Gibraltar in September 1941</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generals.dk/general/Learmont/Duncan_Alexander/Great_Britain.html|title=Learmont, Duncan Alexander|last=|first=|date=|website=generals.dk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n* 142nd General Operation Post (Operations Room)\n*[[13th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (Regular, composite) \u2014 ''raised in [[Gibraltar]] with composite AA units based there, later disbanded on 10 December 1942''\n** RHQ\n** 288th HAA Bty \u2014 ''from [[94th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|94th HAA Regt, RA]]''\n** No.1 Rocket AA Troop, [[Royal Artillery]] (AA Rockets)\n** 1st Radar Detection Finding Bty, RA\n*[[82nd (Essex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (TA)\n** RHQ\n** 156th, 193rd, and 256th HAA Btys\n**[[Gibraltar Defence Force|Gibraltar Defence Force HAA Bty, RA]]\n*[[3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (Regular) \u2014 ''raised in [[Woolwich]] 2 September, arrived in [[Gibraltar]] on 27 September 1941''\n** RHQ\n** 9th, 114th, and 126th LAA Btys\n* 3rd Searchlight Bty, RA (Regular) \u2014 ''Formed 30 December 1939 in [[Gibraltar]], formally administered by the [[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th HAA Regt, RA]]''\n\n=== Gibraltar 'Blitz' ===\n[[File:Searchlights on the Rock of Gibraltar, 1942.jpg|thumb|241x241px|Searchlights over [[Gibraltar]] during an air raid practice on 20 November 1942.]]\n[[File:The British Army on Gibraltar 1941 GM93.jpg|left|thumb|Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun deployed at [[White Rock Battery]], November 1941.]]\nAmong the many tasks facing 15th AA Brigade was the integration of AA fire in defence against sea or land invasion, in which it played an important part.  Equally important was the careful distribution of gun and radar positions to ensure the most effective converge from the increased firepower and the constant practice of day and night barrages, in which live firing was regularly employed and closely recorded, to eliminate errors and weak spots.  Aware of the vulnerability of positions to direct attack after opening fire, each AA position was given a 20mm Oerlikon for self-defence.  The basis of the plan for the revised layer was to bring the fire of 20 HAA gus to bear on a target travelling at 240 mph, approaching from any direction and at a typical height of 12,000 feet.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Routledge, Map 12: The Defence of Gibraltar July 1940</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, the [[Governor of Gibraltar]], [[General]] the Viscount [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]] (Lord Gort) wrote to the [[War Office]] asking for more HAA guns, preferably [[QF 5.25-inch naval gun#Land service|5.25 inch heavy AA guns]], for GLII sets with semi-automatic plotters and another 8 x [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] (LAA guns).  Part of this request was due to 15th AA Brigade's wish to provide the [[Gibraltar International Airport|North airfield]] with its own LAA defence; hitherto it had depended on the main layout for coverage.  Nothing was sent, however, other than 3-inch rockets and their launchers and the airfield received only a small deployment of [[20 mm Polsten]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm guns]] together with some machine-guns, all withdrawn from other positions, and three searchlights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the whole of 1942 there were six bombing raids on Gibraltar, two of which were unidentified, and 18 reconnaissance overflights, all but two of them German. Four aircraft were shot down and others crash-landed in Spain. Some of the Italian raids missed their targets and dropped their bombs in Spanish territory, and Spanish AA guns sometimes opened fire as a raid passed towards them. By the end of 1942, the AA defences of Gibraltar reached a peak of scale and efficiency, but the threat had dwindled. There were only two or three reconnaissance flights during 1943.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"RA82\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|title=82 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218063326/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Joslen5522\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Later Years ===\nIt was [[War Office]] policy that army units should be replaced after three years' service in [[Gibraltar]].

Before formation of the brigade, there were no official 'AA formations' on [[Gibraltar]], but this shortly changed following the [[Battle of France]].  The brigade continued to serve as the prime AA defence formation until it was disbanded in 1944.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|252x252px|3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun at Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar|alt=|left]]\n=== Background ===\nOn the outbreak of war in September 1939 there had only been two batteries (9 and 19 AA Btys) manning the totally inadequate AA defences of Gibraltar, which consisted of four old 3-inch guns and four new 3.7-inch guns, spread in two-gun sections to give the widest possible coverage, and two of the new Bofors 40 mm guns to protect the [[Gibdock|Royal Navy Dockyard]], with the assistance of [[Royal Navy]] (RN) [[QF 2-pounder naval gun#QF%202-pounder%20Mark%20VIII|2-pounder pom-pom guns]]. [[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th AA Rgt]] was formed in December 1939 to command 9 and 19 AA Btys and train the AA Section of the new [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] (GDF), which took over the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the '[[Phoney war]]' period.<ref>Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.</ref><ref name=\":0\">Routledge, pp. 200-4.</ref><ref name=\"RA39\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|title=10 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218082653/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page10.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1939.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1939)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_army/gibraltar.html|title=Gibraltar, 3 September 1939|last=|first=|date=4 December 2012|website=niehorster.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]], a group of AA detachments under [[53rd (City of London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|53rd (City of London) AA Rgt]] escaped from [[Marseilles]] aboard the SS ''Alma Dawson''. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived on 27 June, and once it had unloaded its guns and equipment 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940\u201341, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]], file WO 166/2343.</ref><ref name=\"Joslen552\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\nThere followed a reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, together with the GDF HAA battery, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gunsites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. 10th AA Rgt HQ was ordered to be transferred to [[Malta]] in July, but this did not occur until November when, as part of [[Operation Coat]], a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar and picked it up.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the [[Vichy French Air Force]] in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] on 3 July ([[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|Operation Catapult]]), which had been carried out by [[Force H]] from Gibraltar. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] bomber during a raid by the Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]''. On 24 and 25 September waves of Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and [[Free France|Free French]] attack on [[Dakar]] ([[Battle of Dakar|Operation Menace]]), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. On other occasions the guns fired at single Italian reconnaissance aircraft, known to the garrison as 'Persistent Percy'.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130\u201337, 142.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 1\u20137.</ref><ref>Smith, pp. 57\u201388.</ref><ref name=\"Farn200\">Farndale, pp. 200\u20131.</ref><ref>Rankin, pp. 295\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDuring to the increase of raids and the coming [[North African Campaign]], the [[War Office]] (WO) approved the formation of a new AA Brigade which would handle the increasing demands brought on CRA, Gibraltar.  This new formation was to be known as the '''15th Anti-Aircraft Brigade''' (15th AA Bde) which was to take over all AA matters on the rock.  On 2 September 1941 the brigade was constituted with HQ based at [[RAF Gibraltar]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">Frederick, p. 1049.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/07/Gibraltar-Command-1942.pdf|title=Gibraltar Command Order of Battle (1942)|last=|first=|date=21 July 2019|website=britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>[[File:Gibraltar during the Second World War GM4392.jpg|thumb|The [[Gibraltar Defence Force]] training on a 3.7-inch gun.]]\nThe brigade was then organised as;<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Routledge, Table XXXIV: Page 212.</ref>\n\n* Brigade Headquarters under [[Brigadier]] [[Duncan Learmonth|Duncan Alexander Learmonth]]<ref group=\"Notes\">Assigned directly by the Governor of Gibraltar in September 1941</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generals.dk/general/Learmont/Duncan_Alexander/Great_Britain.html|title=Learmont, Duncan Alexander|last=|first=|date=|website=generals.dk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n* 142nd General Operation Post (Operations Room)\n*[[13th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (Regular, composite) \u2014 ''raised in [[Gibraltar]] with composite AA units based there, later disbanded on 10 December 1942''\n** RHQ\n** 288th HAA Bty \u2014 ''from [[94th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|94th HAA Regt, RA]]''\n** No.1 Rocket AA Troop, [[Royal Artillery]] (AA Rockets)\n** 1st Radar Detection Finding Bty, RA\n*[[82nd (Essex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (TA)\n** RHQ\n** 156th, 193rd, and 256th HAA Btys\n**[[Gibraltar Defence Force|Gibraltar Defence Force HAA Bty, RA]]\n*[[3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]] (Regular) \u2014 ''raised in [[Woolwich]] 2 September, arrived in [[Gibraltar]] on 27 September 1941''\n** RHQ\n** 9th, 114th, and 126th LAA Btys\n* 3rd Searchlight Bty, RA (Regular) \u2014 ''Formed 30 December 1939 in [[Gibraltar]], formally administered by the [[10th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|10th HAA Regt, RA]]''\n\n=== Gibraltar 'Blitz' ===\n[[File:Searchlights on the Rock of Gibraltar, 1942.jpg|thumb|241x241px|Searchlights over [[Gibraltar]] during an air raid practice on 20 November 1942.]]\n[[File:The British Army on Gibraltar 1941 GM93.jpg|left|thumb|Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun deployed at [[White Rock Battery]], November 1941.]]\nAmong the many tasks facing 15th AA Brigade was the integration of AA fire in defence against sea or land invasion, in which it played an important part.  Equally important was the careful distribution of gun and radar positions to ensure the most effective converge from the increased firepower and the constant practice of day and night barrages, in which live firing was regularly employed and closely recorded, to eliminate errors and weak spots.  Aware of the vulnerability of positions to direct attack after opening fire, each AA position was given a 20mm Oerlikon for self-defence.  The basis of the plan for the revised layer was to bring the fire of 20 HAA gus to bear on a target travelling at 240 mph, approaching from any direction and at a typical height of 12,000 feet.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Routledge, Map 12: The Defence of Gibraltar July 1940</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, the [[Governor of Gibraltar]], [[General]] the Viscount [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]] (Lord Gort) wrote to the [[War Office]] asking for more HAA guns, preferably [[QF 5.25-inch naval gun#Land service|5.25 inch heavy AA guns]], for GLII sets with semi-automatic plotters and another 8 x [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] (LAA guns).  Part of this request was due to 15th AA Brigade's wish to provide the [[Gibraltar International Airport|North airfield]] with its own LAA defence; hitherto it had depended on the main layout for coverage.  Nothing was sent, however, other than 3-inch rockets and their launchers and the airfield received only a small deployment of [[20 mm Polsten]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm guns]] together with some machine-guns, all withdrawn from other positions, and three searchlights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the whole of 1942 there were six bombing raids on Gibraltar, two of which were unidentified, and 18 reconnaissance overflights, all but two of them German. Four aircraft were shot down and others crash-landed in Spain. Some of the Italian raids missed their targets and dropped their bombs in Spanish territory, and Spanish AA guns sometimes opened fire as a raid passed towards them. By the end of 1942, the AA defences of Gibraltar reached a peak of scale and efficiency, but the threat had dwindled. There were only two or three reconnaissance flights during 1943.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"RA82\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|title=82 HAA Rgt at RA 39\u201345|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218063326/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/haa/page45.html|archive-date=2011-02-18|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Joslen5522\">Joslen, pp. 552\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Later Years ===\nIt was [[War Office]] policy that army units should be replaced after three years' service in [[Gibraltar]].

Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like [[nutmeg]] or [[coriander]], but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain citrus, vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by [[citric acid|citric]] or other isolated acids. [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola's recipe]] is maintained as a corporate [[trade secret]].\n\nA variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized [[Maize|corn]]. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=M.

They now come in numerous different [[brand]]s. Among them, the most popular are Coca-Cola and [[Pepsi]]. These two companies have been competing since the 1890s, but their [[Cola wars|rivalry has intensified since the 1980s]].\n\n==Flavorings==\nThe primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are [[citrus]] [[essential oil|oils]] (from [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and [[lemon]] [[Peel (fruit)|peels]]), [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]], and an [[acid]]ic flavorant.<ref>{{cite web|author=DeNeefe, Janet |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/13/the-exotic-romance-tamarind.html |title=The Exotic Romance of Tamarind |work=The Jakarta Post |date=March 13, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sparror.cubecinema.com/cube/cola/chemistry/cola2.htm |title=Cola 2 |publisher=Sparror.cubecinema.com |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like [[nutmeg]] or [[coriander]], but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain citrus, vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by [[citric acid|citric]] or other isolated acids. [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola's recipe]] is maintained as a corporate [[trade secret]].\n\nA variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized [[Maize|corn]]. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=M.

Crystal Pepsi has been repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s.\n\nIn Denmark, a popular clear cola was made by the [[Cooperative]] [[Coop amba|FDB]] in 1976. It was especially known for being the \"Hippie Cola\" because of the focus of the harmful effects the [[color additive]] could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands. It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the Environmental-Organisation NOAH, an independent Danish division of [[Friends of the Earth]].

At the same time, a war between the demons and the guardians of light took place, with the demons led by the Black King of Darkness attacking the lands in the sky. The Black Prince however, despite the wishes of the Black King, defied his orders and falls in love with the White Maiden, in hopes that their union would end the war. Both were not meant to meet and love each other as the war ravaged the world around the land and the skies.\n\nSeveral millennia after the war, in a world consisting of numerous isles, a young hero from the Astora Isle encounters the adventurer Kyle and follows him on an expedition on the isle. They meet a mysterious girl named Iris and a talking white cat named Catra, and together they make their way to the isle's ruins, where they find a flying island. Kyle becomes consumed by darkness there, and the party resolves to travel to the ends of the world on the flying island in order to find the seven \"Great Runes\", following Kyle's words before he disappeared.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u767d\u732b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |url=https://colopl.co.jp/shironekoproject/character/ |website=Colopl |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> Upon their adventures towards finding the Runes, both the hero and Iris start to fill the pieces, meeting friends and enemies and discovering their true identities.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''White Cat Project'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with [[touchscreen]] controls, where the player controls the character by dragging the finger across the screen (a mechanic Colopl calls \"Punicon\") and tapping to attack. Special abilities can be activated by holding the finger on the character, which opens up a selection menu of abilities. All of these actions can be done using one finger only, which facilitates one-handed gaming.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Eugene |title=White Cat Project Is An Action RPG Played With Just Your Thumb |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/07/12/white-cat-project-action-rpg-played-just-thumb/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=12 November 2018 |date=12 July 2014}}</ref>  \n\nThe characters also have their own classes corresponding to weapon types, for example swords, bows, and mage staffs. In general, most characters are gained via a \"Summon\" tab which works on a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system. Runes are spent on randomized characters, with some characters being common and other characters being rare.  Some characters can be gained for free by completing in-game missions. While the game is fully playable as a [[single-player]] experience, it also supports up to four-player co-operative [[multiplayer]]. There is also a [[City-building game|town-building mode]] where players can build and upgrade structures that generate in-game currencies and provide combat bonuses to their characters.

At the same time, a war between the demons and the guardians of light took place, with the demons led by the Black King of Darkness attacking the lands in the sky. The Black Prince however, despite the wishes of the Black King, defied his orders and falls in love with the White Maiden, in hopes that their union would end the war. Both were not meant to meet and love each other as the war ravaged the world around the land and the skies.\n\nSeveral millennia after the war, in a world consisting of numerous isles, a young hero from the Astora Isle encounters the adventurer Kyle and follows him on an expedition on the isle. They meet a mysterious girl named Iris and a talking white cat named Catra, and together they make their way to the isle's ruins, where they find a flying island. Kyle becomes consumed by darkness there, and the party resolves to travel to the ends of the world on the flying island in order to find the seven \"Great Runes\", following Kyle's words before he disappeared.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u767d\u732b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |url=https://colopl.co.jp/shironekoproject/character/ |website=Colopl |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> Upon their adventures towards finding the Runes, both the hero and Iris start to fill the pieces, meeting friends and enemies and discovering their true identities.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''White Cat Project'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with [[touchscreen]] controls, where the player controls the character by dragging the finger across the screen (a mechanic Colopl calls \"Punicon\") and tapping to attack. Special abilities can be activated by holding the finger on the character, which opens up a selection menu of abilities. All of these actions can be done using one finger only, which facilitates one-handed gaming.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Eugene |title=White Cat Project Is An Action RPG Played With Just Your Thumb |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/07/12/white-cat-project-action-rpg-played-just-thumb/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=12 November 2018 |date=12 July 2014}}</ref>  \n\nThe characters also have their own classes corresponding to weapon types, for example swords, bows, and mage staffs. In general, most characters are gained via a \"Summon\" tab which works on a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.
