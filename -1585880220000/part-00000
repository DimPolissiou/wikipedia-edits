In addition, the area is popular for mountain climbers, who climb the Grimming, the [[Totes Gebirge]] mountains, and in the southern ''Niedere Tauern''. In W\u00f6rschachwald is a small winter sports area and the Spechtensee lake, a popular destination.

The construction of the Salzkammergut railway in 1877, also a bus stop in P\u00fcrgg and Stainach station (now called Stainach-Irdning) emerged and became the railway junction.\n\nAfter the annexation of Austria in 1938, today's municipal territory came to the Reichsgau of Styria. From 1945 to 1955, it was part of the British occupation zone in Austria. Since then, the municipal area belongs to Styria.\n\nThe town Stainach-P\u00fcrgg, in its present form, was created only at the beginning of the year 2015. It was part of the [[Steierm\u00e4rkische Gemeindestrukturreform |Styrian municipality structural reform]], in which the independent municipalities Stainach and P\u00fcrgg-Trautenfels were merged.\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n[[File:P\u00fcrgg Johanneskapelle Innenraum 01.JPG|thumb]]\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nIn addition to tourism, the food industry is an important economic factor for the municipality.\n\n== Tourism ==\nSchloss Trautenfels and the picturesque hamlet of P\u00fcrgg have attracted numerous tourists and excursionists. In addition, the area is popular for mountain climbers, who climb the Grimming, the [[Totes Gebirge]] mountains, and in the southern ''Niedere Tauern''. In W\u00f6rschachwald is a small winter sports area and the Spechtensee lake, a popular destination. Therefore, it is not surprising that the municipality has numerous inns and hostels.\n\n== Industries ==\nThe local industrial enterprises deal with food processing:\n* Ennstal Milch KG, dairy (Maresi etc.)\n* Landena KG, food industry\n\n=== Transportation ===\nThe place is home, with the Stainach-Irdning Station, to an Austrian railway junction. Here the Salzkammergutbahn runs onto the Enns Valley Railway. In addition, there is a stop of the Salzkammergutbahn in P\u00fcrgg.\n\nAn important road junction is in the hamlet of Trautenfels. This is where the main connecting route from Salzburg to Graz (Ennstal Road B&nbsp;320) joins the Salzkammergut Road B&nbsp;145, which leads to the Salzkammergut.\n\n=== Town offices ===\nThe town is the seat of the local agricultural authority.\n\n=== Education ===\nThe town situates a federal gymnasium school and a federal realgymnasium.\n\n==  Notable residents ==\n* [[Adolf Adam]] (1918\u20132004), computer scientist and statistician\n* [[Grete Dierkes]] (1882\u20131957), actress and singer\n* [[Robert Gattinger]] (1902\u20131980), painter and graphic artist\n* [[Pope Gregory V]] (972\u2013999), first pope from the area of modern Austria\n* [[Karl von Winckler]] (1912\u20131988), entrepreneur and businessman\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat}}\n{{StatistikAustria|61267}}\n* [http://www.stainach-puergg.gv.at/ Website of Stainach-P\u00fcrgg]\n\n{{Liezen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stainach-Purgg}}\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Liezen District]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainach-P%C3%BCrgg"}

P\u00e9rez received 53% of the vote, while the others gained at least 40%. P\u00e9rez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The program, called ''El Gran Viraje'' (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the ''paquete'' (the \"package\"), was contrary to statements made during P\u00e9rez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\"<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040189,00.html Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, Obituary], Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011</ref>\n\nMeasures taken by P\u00e9rez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. On the weekend of 25-26 February 1989, gasoline prices rose 100 per cent, as had been laid out in the economic adjustment program announced by the government on February 16. The fuel price increase in turn necessitated an increase in public transportation fares of 30 per cent officially, and more in practice as some carriers refused to limit their prices to the official rate.<ref name=\"margarita_l_m_2003_p120-1\" >Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, 2003. \"The Venezuelan Caracazo of 1989: Popular Protest and Institutional Weakness\", ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', Vol.35, No.1 (2003), pp 120-121 (See #Further reading).</ref>\n\nAccording to retired Venezuelan General Carlos Julio Pe\u00f1aloza Zambrano, Cuban agents might have entered Venezuela during Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez's inauguration ceremony, which was attended by [[Fidel Castro]], and may have waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.<ref name=\"DELFINcoro\">{{cite book|last1=Pe\u00f1aloza|first1=General Carlos|title=El Delf\u00edn de Fidel: La historia oculta tras el golpe del 4F|date=2014|isbn=1505750334|page=185|quote=On February 5, 1989, the transmission of Lusinchi's command to P\u00e9rez was effected with a lavish ceremony unprecedented in a democracy.

Nevertheless, the administration of the [[political left|left]]-leaning President [[Jaime Lusinchi]] was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.<ref>[[Barcelona Centre for International Affairs]], Jaime Lusinchi, (Spanish) http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2</ref>\n\nLusinchi's political party, the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]], was able to remain in power following the [[Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1988|1988 election]] of [[Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]] as president. P\u00e9rez received 53% of the vote, while the others gained at least 40%. P\u00e9rez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The program, called ''El Gran Viraje'' (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the ''paquete'' (the \"package\"), was contrary to statements made during P\u00e9rez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\"<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040189,00.html Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, Obituary], Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011</ref>\n\nMeasures taken by P\u00e9rez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. On the weekend of 25-26 February 1989, gasoline prices rose 100 per cent, as had been laid out in the economic adjustment program announced by the government on February 16. The fuel price increase in turn necessitated an increase in public transportation fares of 30 per cent officially, and more in practice as some carriers refused to limit their prices to the official rate.<ref name=\"margarita_l_m_2003_p120-1\" >Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, 2003. \"The Venezuelan Caracazo of 1989: Popular Protest and Institutional Weakness\", ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', Vol.35, No.1 (2003), pp 120-121 (See #Further reading).</ref>\n\nAccording to retired Venezuelan General Carlos Julio Pe\u00f1aloza Zambrano, Cuban agents might have entered Venezuela during Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez's inauguration ceremony, which was attended by [[Fidel Castro]], and may have waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.<ref name=\"DELFINcoro\">{{cite book|last1=Pe\u00f1aloza|first1=General Carlos|title=El Delf\u00edn de Fidel: La historia oculta tras el golpe del 4F|date=2014|isbn=1505750334|page=185|quote=On February 5, 1989, the transmission of Lusinchi's command to P\u00e9rez was effected with a lavish ceremony unprecedented in a democracy.
