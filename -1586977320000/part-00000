{"title_page": "Cotton diplomacy", "text_new": "'''Cotton diplomacy''' refers to the diplomatic methods employed by [[Confederate States of America|the Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] to coerce the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] to support the Confederate war effort by implementing a [[cotton]] trade [[embargo]] against the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. The Confederacy believed that both the United Kingdom and France, who before the war depended heavily on southern cotton for [[textile manufacturing]], would support the Confederate war effort if the cotton trade were restricted. Ultimately, cotton diplomacy did not work in favor of the Confederacy. In fact, the cotton embargo transformed into a self-embargo which restricted the Confederate economy. Ultimately, the growth in the demand for cotton that fueled the antebellum economy did not continue.<ref>Ransom, Roger L.
