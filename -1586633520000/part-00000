His paternal grandparents were [[Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and Princess [[Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]] (daughter of King [[Louis Philippe I]] of France) and his maternal grandparents were Emperor Pedro II of Brazil and Empress [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|Teresa Cristina]] (daughter of King [[Francis I of the Two Sicilies]]).<ref name=\"Wehrs\">[[#refWehrs|Wehrs]], 278-279</ref> His elder brother was [[Prince Pedro Augusto of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; his two younger brothers were Prince Joseph and [[Prince Ludwig Gaston of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ludwig Gaston]].\n\nHis birth was announced by the Emperor to the nation in the [[Speech from the Throne]] of May 9, 1868:\n\n{{quote|I am pleased to announce to you that my beloved daughter, Princess Leopoldina, having returned from Europe with the Duke of Saxony, my very dear son-in-law, gave birth on December 6 of last year to a prince, who was given the name of Augusto.<ref>Annaes do Senado, 29</ref>}}\n\nBack in Europe, Princess Leopoldina reported from her youngest sister. The prince, however, had little contact with his mother, who died on February 7, 1871, when he was a little over three years old. His father decided to settle definitively in [[Austria-Hungary]], where his children were in the care of their paternal grandmother. [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]] had not yet had any children at the time of her sister's death and the lack of heirs had already caused concern among the Brazilians. In a letter dated March 4, 1871, the Brazilian ambassador to Vienna, [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]] (future Viscount of Porto Seguro), said to the Emperor:\n\n{{quote|If the august grandchildren of HIM, Sr, will one day be princes of the Empire, all Brazilians will desire that they be brought up and educated in Brazil, whereas nothing will lose any of them with such education, if luck will call it To another destination in Europe, and it is less likely that it seems that the succession may fall to their fourth, can not conceive in this respect anything impossible if anyone remembers that (in the history of Portugal itself) to reach To compel the throne to the fortunate Dom Manuel, he had to take charge of taking before him, as I recall, some fourteen who had first right to the throne of Dom Jo\u00e3o II.<ref name=\"Lessa\">[[#refLessa|Lessa]], 123</ref>}}\n\nIn his first trip to Europe, still in 1871, Emperor Pedro II decided to bring his grandchildren to Brazil, to create them as eventual heirs to the throne.<ref name=\"Defrance\">Defrance, 233-234</ref> A family council determined that Princess Leopoldina's two eldest children would be cared for by their maternal grandparents, being raised and educated in Brazil.<ref name=\"Defrance\"/> Thus, on April 1, 1872, Dom Pedro Augusto and Dom Augusto Leopoldo, accompanied by the imperial couple, arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where they were received with great enthusiasm.<ref>Del Priore, 11</ref>\n\nThe re-acclimatization to the native homeland was difficult for the brothers.

He was the second of four sons born to German [[Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Princess Leopoldina of Brazil]].\n\nThe second grandson of the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], the prince was, for some years between the presumptive heirs to the Imperial Crown of Brazil.

His paternal grandparents were [[Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and Princess [[Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]] (daughter of King [[Louis Philippe I]] of France) and his maternal grandparents were Emperor Pedro II of Brazil and Empress [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|Teresa Cristina]] (daughter of King [[Francis I of the Two Sicilies]]).<ref name=\"Wehrs\">[[#refWehrs|Wehrs]], 278-279</ref> His elder brother was [[Prince Pedro Augusto of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; his two younger brothers were Prince Joseph and [[Prince Ludwig Gaston of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ludwig Gaston]].\n\nHis birth was announced by the Emperor to the nation in the [[Speech from the Throne]] of May 9, 1868:\n\n{{quote|I am pleased to announce to you that my beloved daughter, Princess Leopoldina, having returned from Europe with the Duke of Saxony, my very dear son-in-law, gave birth on December 6 of last year to a prince, who was given the name of Augusto.<ref>Annaes do Senado, 29</ref>}}\n\nBack in Europe, Princess Leopoldina reported from her youngest sister. The prince, however, had little contact with his mother, who died on February 7, 1871, when he was a little over three years old. His father decided to settle definitively in [[Austria-Hungary]], where his children were in the care of their paternal grandmother. [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]] had not yet had any children at the time of her sister's death and the lack of heirs had already caused concern among the Brazilians. In a letter dated March 4, 1871, the Brazilian ambassador to Vienna, [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]] (future Viscount of Porto Seguro), said to the Emperor:\n\n{{quote|If the august grandchildren of HIM, Sr, will one day be princes of the Empire, all Brazilians will desire that they be brought up and educated in Brazil, whereas nothing will lose any of them with such education, if luck will call it To another destination in Europe, and it is less likely that it seems that the succession may fall to their fourth, can not conceive in this respect anything impossible if anyone remembers that (in the history of Portugal itself) to reach To compel the throne to the fortunate Dom Manuel, he had to take charge of taking before him, as I recall, some fourteen who had first right to the throne of Dom Jo\u00e3o II.<ref name=\"Lessa\">[[#refLessa|Lessa]], 123</ref>}}\n\nIn his first trip to Europe, still in 1871, Emperor Pedro II decided to bring his grandchildren to Brazil, to create them as eventual heirs to the throne.<ref name=\"Defrance\">Defrance, 233-234</ref> A family council determined that Princess Leopoldina's two eldest children would be cared for by their maternal grandparents, being raised and educated in Brazil.<ref name=\"Defrance\"/> Thus, on April 1, 1872, Dom Pedro Augusto and Dom Augusto Leopoldo, accompanied by the imperial couple, arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where they were received with great enthusiasm.<ref>Del Priore, 11</ref>\n\nThe re-acclimatization to the native homeland was difficult for the brothers. Accustomed to the luxury of the palaces of Vienna and Styria, they began to live in the modest and old-fashioned [[Pal\u00e1cio de S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o|Palace of S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o]], where they played little because of the rigid routine of studies imposed by their grandfather.<ref name=\"Del Priore\">Del Priore, 60</ref> They had as preceptor the then rector of the ''Externato Dom Pedro II'', Manuel Pacheco da Silva (future Baron of Pacheco), and they spent the days training mount and studying French classics, rhetoric, history, geography, languages and music. \n\nAlthough his older brother enjoyed the status of Pedro II's favorite grandson, due to their affinity for studies, other chroniclers noted that Augusto's temper, completely opposite to that of his grandfather, made him the monarch's favorite. \n\n===Career===\nHaving inherited from his father and grandfather's love for the Navy, he entered as an aspirant at the [[Brazilian Naval School|Naval Academy]] in December 1882, at the age of fifteen.<ref name=\"Lessa1\">Lessa, 125</ref> With a school curriculum described as brilliant, Augusto formed a marine guard in 1886.\n\nIn the [[Imperial Brazilian Navy]], Prince Augusto arrived at the post of second lieutenant (equivalent, now the first lieutenant), serving on board the ''Niter\u00f3i'' Corvette, the [[Brazilian battleship Riachuelo|battleship Riachuelo]] and the Cruiser ''Almirante Barroso'', in addition to being the helper of orders of Admiral Eduardo Wandenkolk, future republican leader.<ref name=\"Lessa1\"/>\n\n===Republic and exile===\n[[File:Pr\u00edncipe D.

One of India's highest-paid and most popular celebrities, Chopra has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Priyanka Chopra|numerous awards]], including one [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and five [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2016, the [[Government of India]] honoured her with the [[Padma Shri]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the [[Time 100#2016|100 most influential people in the world]]. In 2017 and 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed her among the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]].\n\nAlthough Chopra initially aspired to study [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]], she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy]]'' (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits ''[[Andaaz]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mujhse Shaadi Karogi]]'' (2004) and received critical acclaim for her [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]] in the 2004 thriller ''[[Aitraaz]]''. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.\n\nFollowing a brief setback, she garnered success in 2008 for playing a troubled model in the drama ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', which won her the [[National Film Award for Best Actress]], and a glamorous journalist in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]''. Chopra gained wider recognition for portraying a range of characters in the films ''[[Kaminey]]'' (2009), ''[[7 Khoon Maaf]]'' (2011), ''[[Barfi!]]'' (2012), ''[[Mary Kom (film)|Mary Kom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015). From 2015 to 2018, she starred as [[Alex Parrish]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] thriller series ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]''. Chopra has since played supporting roles in the Hollywood comedies ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' (2017) and ''[[Isn't It Romantic (2019 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (2019), and returned to Hindi cinema with a leading role in the biopic ''[[The Sky Is Pink]]'' (2019).\n\nChopra also promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights, and is vocal about gender equality, gender pay gap, and feminism.  She has worked with [[UNICEF]] since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to unprivileged Indian children. As a recording artist, Chopra has released three [[single (music)|singles]] and provided vocals for a number of her film songs. She is also the founder of the production company [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], under which she has produced several [[Cinema of India#Regional cinema|regional Indians films]], including the acclaimed [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] film ''[[Ventilator (2016 film)|Ventilator]]'' (2016). Despite maintaining privacy, Chopra's off-screen life, including her marriage to the American singer and actor [[Nick Jonas]], is the subject of substantial media coverage.\n\n==Early life==\nPriyanka Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in [[Jamshedpur]], [[Bihar]] (present-day [[Jharkhand]]), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the [[Indian Army]].<ref name=bday1>{{cite web|title=Birthday Special: 30 Facts About Priyanka Chopra |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-birthday-special-priyanka-chopra/20120718.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926075555/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-birthday-special-priyanka-chopra/20120718.htm |archivedate=26 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=bday2>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Birthday-blast-Priyanka-Chopra-s-Top-30-moments-in-showbiz/Article1-890611.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718055252/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Birthday-blast-Priyanka-Chopra-s-Top-30-moments-in-showbiz/Article1-890611.aspx|archivedate=18 July 2012|title=Birthday blast: Priyanka Chopra's Top 30 moments in showbiz |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=17 July 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Her father was a [[Punjabi Hindu]] from [[Ambala]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"I'll get married six times\" \u2013 Priyanka Chopra |url=http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/ill-get-married-six-times-priyanka-chopra-4412.html |work=[[Filmfare]] |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806083606/http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/ill-get-married-six-times-priyanka-chopra-4412.html |archivedate= 6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priyanka-Chopra-missed-visiting-her-hometown-Ambala/articleshow/47502145.cms |title=Priyanka Chopra missed visiting her hometown Ambala |author=Batra, Ankur |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708160043/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priyanka-Chopra-missed-visiting-her-hometown-Ambala/articleshow/47502145.cms |archivedate= 8 July 2015}}</ref> Her mother Madhu Chopra from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] veteran<ref>{{cite web|title=Much ado about Adieu |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Much-ado-about-Adieu/2016/06/12/article3478145.ece |author=Chandran, Abhilash |work=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=12 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613134407/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Much-ado-about-Adieu/2016/06/12/article3478145.ece |archivedate=13 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyanka-chopra-harassed-by-unknown-man/143892-8-66.html |title=Priyanka Chopra harassed by unknown man |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204003258/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyanka-chopra-harassed-by-unknown-man/143892-8-66.html |archivedate= 4 December 2013}}</ref> and Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri (n\u00e9e Mary John), a former member of [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]].

It is almost always very close to upturned umbrella shaped with a partially developed flat top, making it easy to recognise in mixed woodland. In this it differs from most of the other ''[[Brachystegia]]'' species that have variable shapes. The leaves are feathery in appearance, with around 10-12 leaflets arrayed along each leaf stalk.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe muunze is found all over south tropical [[Africa]] and the less humid parts of east equatorial Africa. It reaches its southernmost extent around 21\u00b0 S in the [[Runde]] valley region of [[Zimbabwe]]. It is a tree of inland regions thriving at altitudes of around 900 \u2013 1750 metres. In the hotter, northern parts of its range it is found in drier types of woodland but further south it is found in both moist and dry open woodland. It prefers well-drained conditions and tolerates even very thin and rocky soils and so is usually restricted to hillsides and hilltops (not mountainous regions as such) rather than best positions in valley floors. In these positions, the tree is very easily recognisable due to its fluttering foliage, distinctive shape and flaky but smooth grey bark.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe muunze is nowhere common but is widely distributed in its range and grows to its maximum size where many other trees find the soil too thin or poor; about 14 \u2013 16 metres depending on competition. It is a tree of open woodland in areas of contrasting wet and dry seasons, the longer the dry season, the more likely that the muunze stands bare for a notable period. Like other ''Brachystegia'' species it needs a cool, dry resting period when it loses its leaves followed by a hot dry spell that revives the tree. At this time (usually August\u2013September) the new leaves are produced. These are a pale to rich red colour that fade to green over about a week. The muunze is therefore a beautiful sight in springtime but it does not compare to the much more striking show put on by the closely related [[msasa]].\nThe seeds are enclosed in a purplish woody pod. The seeds are dispersed, as in other ''Brachystegia'' species, when the drying pod is split by increasing tension in autumn (about April to May or later), hurling the seeds from it.\n\nWoodland of ''Brachystegia tamarindoides'' subsp. ''microphylla'' grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes in the [[Chimanimani Mountains]] of [[Mozambique]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of ''[[Usnea]]'' lichen, with a sparse understory.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.
