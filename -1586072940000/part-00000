Finally, on November 19, the update was also made available as part of the [[Windows Server 2016]] Technical Preview 4.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn November 2017, Microsoft released [[Porting|ports]] of Edge for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. The apps feature integration and synchronization with the desktop version on Windows 10 PCs. Due to platform restrictions and other factors, these ports do not use the same layout engine as the desktop version, and instead use OS-native [[Webkit]]-based engines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/30/microsoft-edge-iphone-android-is-available/|title=Microsoft Edge for iPhone and Android is out of beta|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/10/05/announcing-microsoft-edge-for-ios-and-android-microsoft-launcher/ |title=Announcing Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android, Microsoft Launcher |last=Belfiore |first=Joe |date=October 5, 2017 |website=Windows Blogs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007021806/https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/10/05/announcing-microsoft-edge-for-ios-and-android-microsoft-launcher/ |archivedate=October 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"MJ, Spider-Man ported to iOS+Android\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-bringing-new-edge-apps-to-ios-android/ |title=Microsoft is bringing new Edge apps to iOS, Android |last=Foley |first=Mary Jo |authorlink=Mary Jo Foley |date=October 5, 2017 |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103190907/http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-bringing-new-edge-apps-to-ios-android/ |archivedate=January 3, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2018, Edge added tab audio muting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/microsofts-edge-browser-not-lets-you-mute-tabs/|title=Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser now lets you mute tabs|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> In June 2018, support for the [[Web Authentication]] specifications were added to Windows Insider builds, with support for [[Windows Hello]] and external security tokens.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/05/31/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17682/#oHYCS0GkF95OMzKH.97 |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17682 |author=Sarkar |display-authors=etal |publisher=Microsoft |date=2018-05-23 |accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/31/microsoft-edge-now-supports-passwordless-sign-ins/|title=Microsoft Edge now supports passwordless sign-ins|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\n===Anaheim (2019\u2013present)===\nOn December 6, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to base Edge on the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] source code, using the same rendering engine as [[Google Chrome]] but with enhancements developed by Microsoft.

Different species of ''Omeisaurus'' sometimes shared habitats with each other (''O. junghsiensis'' and ''O. tianfuensis'', for example). In addition to other species of ''Omeisaurus'', ''[[Shunosaurus]]'' and ''[[Datousaurus]]'' are also known from the Xiashaximiao Formation, while ''Mamenchisaurus'' is present in the Shangshaximiao Formation. ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]'' is a large theropod from the Shangshaximiao, and it probably preyed on sauropods. The smaller ''[[Xuanhanosaurus]]'' was also present. In the Xiashaximiao, another theropod, ''[[Gasosaurus]]'', was also present, as was the herbivorous [[stegosaur]] ''[[Huayangosaurus]]''.

It was named after the sacred mountain Omeishan, which is where the first fossil example of ''Omeisaurus'' was found. Most skeletons of ''Omeisaurus'' were found in the 1970s and 1980s, during the great \u201cChinese dinosaur rush\u201d. There have been eight species of ''Omeisaurus'' named so far: ''O. junghsiensis'', ''O. changshouensis'', ''O. fuxiensis'', ''O. tianfuensis'', ''O. luoquanensis'', ''O. maoianus'', ''O. jiaoi'', and ''O. puxiani''.<ref>JIANG Shan, LI Fei, PENG Guang-Zhao, & YE Yong (2011).

''O. fuxiensis'' was the smallest species, measuring around {{convert|35|ft|m}} long. ''O. tianfuensis'' had the longest neck of the genus, around {{convert|30|ft|m}} long. The only dinosaur with a longer neck was ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.

The species ''O. fuxiensis'' is sometimes confused with ''[[Zigongosaurus]]'', but the two are based on different material despite having the same species name.\n\n''Omeisaurus'' was formerly assigned to [[Euhelopodidae]].

Different species of ''Omeisaurus'' sometimes shared habitats with each other (''O. junghsiensis'' and ''O. tianfuensis'', for example). In addition to other species of ''Omeisaurus'', ''[[Shunosaurus]]'' and ''[[Datousaurus]]'' are also known from the Xiashaximiao Formation, while ''Mamenchisaurus'' is present in the Shangshaximiao Formation. ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]'' is a large theropod from the Shangshaximiao, and it probably preyed on sauropods. The smaller ''[[Xuanhanosaurus]]'' was also present. In the Xiashaximiao, another theropod, ''[[Gasosaurus]]'', was also present, as was the herbivorous [[stegosaur]] ''[[Huayangosaurus]]''. The latter probably did not compete with sauropods for food.<ref name=\"paul2010\">{{cite book | last1 = Paul | first1 = G.S. | date = 2010 | title = The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs | chapter = Sauropodomorphs\n| publisher = Princeton University Press | page = 244 | chapter-url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10851.html | isbn = 9780691167664 | location = Princeton}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book|author=[[Dong Zhiming]]|year=1988|title=Dinosaurs from China|publisher=China Ocean Press, Beijing & British Museum (Natural History)|isbn=978-0-565-01073-7}}\n*Britt, Carpenter et al.

The film stars [[Taylor Lautner]], Taylor Dooley, [[Cayden Boyd]], [[David Arquette]], [[Kristin Davis]] and [[George Lopez]]. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The special effects were done by [[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels, [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Troublemaker Digital. \n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism directed at the film's story and poor 3-D. The film also underperformed at the box office earning just $39 million in the United States and $69.4&nbsp;million worldwide on a $50&nbsp;million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMax is a 10-year-old lonely child in the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] who creates an imaginary dreamworld named Planet Drool, where all of his dreams come to life. He creates two characters; Sharkboy, who was raised by sharks after losing his father (who was a marine biologist) at sea and became a shark-hybrid himself, and Lavagirl, who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them on fire. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In reality, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marriage is not going well. Max is also bullied by fellow classmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, the daughter of his teacher Mr. Electricidad. After a chase, Linus steals Max's dream journal and vandalizes it. The next day, as Max attempts to retaliate, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the tornadoes and have Max accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad because of Mr. Electric, a robot resembling Mr. Electricidad and the dreamworld's now-corrupt electrician, who is working for an unknown mastermind.\n\nThey confront Mr. Electric, who drops them into the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a robot toy that Max never finished building in the real world after being discouraged by his father. Tobor gives them a lift to other parts of the planet. The three form a friendship during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \"plughounds\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to the mastermind, who is revealed to be Minus, a villain resembling Linus who has altered the dreamworld with Max's journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by singing bubbles called LaLas and has a \"shark frenzy\", destroying the cage. After they escape, Max retrieves the dream journal from Minus while he is sleeping. Max informs Sharkboy that his father is alive in his book, but when Lavagirl wishes to learn what it says about her true identity, she burns the book to ash. In rage, Lavagirl asks Max why she is made out of lava, but Sharkboy tells him to let her cool down.\n\nAfter an encounter with the Ice Guardian, Max, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl reach the Ice Princess, who resembles Marissa. She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they are too late to stop the corruption since the Ice Princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power, and she cannot leave her home. Mr. Electric seemingly kills Sharkboy by fooling him into jumping into water filled with electric eels, which are his weakness, with Lavagirl sacrificing herself by jumping into the water to retrieve Sharkboy. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream. Just then, Sharkboy regains consciousness and races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer and defeats Minus, then offers to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, to which Minus agrees.\n\nMinus offers Mr. Electric to return to running Planet Drool, but Mr. Electric reveals that he never enjoyed doing so in the first place. He also informs Max that he made a terrible mistake of dreaming him up and flies to Earth to kill Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric emerges from the tornado before Max and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents are caught in the storm as well, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to freeze and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his parents.\n\nMax later informs his class that Planet Drool has become a proper dreamworld once again, Sharkboy became the King of the Ocean, and Lavagirl became Queen of the Volcanoes, and as the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class to \"dream a better dream, and work to make it real\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Max.

Marissa is the daughter of Mr. Electricidad, and at first the only student who befriends Max. On Planet Drool, she appears as the Ice Princess, the ruler of the Ice Kingdom and keeper of the Crystal Heart, which is a necklace she wears which can freeze anything including time.\n* [[Robert Rodriguez]] has a role voicing a shark.

The film stars [[Taylor Lautner]], Taylor Dooley, [[Cayden Boyd]], [[David Arquette]], [[Kristin Davis]] and [[George Lopez]]. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The special effects were done by [[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels, [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Troublemaker Digital. \n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism directed at the film's story and poor 3-D. The film also underperformed at the box office earning just $39 million in the United States and $69.4&nbsp;million worldwide on a $50&nbsp;million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMax is a 10-year-old lonely child in the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] who creates an imaginary dreamworld named Planet Drool, where all of his dreams come to life. He creates two characters; Sharkboy, who was raised by sharks after losing his father (who was a marine biologist) at sea and became a shark-hybrid himself, and Lavagirl, who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them on fire. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In reality, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marriage is not going well. Max is also bullied by fellow classmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, the daughter of his teacher Mr. Electricidad. After a chase, Linus steals Max's dream journal and vandalizes it. The next day, as Max attempts to retaliate, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the tornadoes and have Max accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad because of Mr. Electric, a robot resembling Mr. Electricidad and the dreamworld's now-corrupt electrician, who is working for an unknown mastermind.\n\nThey confront Mr. Electric, who drops them into the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a robot toy that Max never finished building in the real world after being discouraged by his father. Tobor gives them a lift to other parts of the planet. The three form a friendship during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \"plughounds\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to the mastermind, who is revealed to be Minus, a villain resembling Linus who has altered the dreamworld with Max's journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by singing bubbles called LaLas and has a \"shark frenzy\", destroying the cage. After they escape, Max retrieves the dream journal from Minus while he is sleeping. Max informs Sharkboy that his father is alive in his book, but when Lavagirl wishes to learn what it says about her true identity, she burns the book to ash. In rage, Lavagirl asks Max why she is made out of lava, but Sharkboy tells him to let her cool down.\n\nAfter an encounter with the Ice Guardian, Max, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl reach the Ice Princess, who resembles Marissa. She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they are too late to stop the corruption since the Ice Princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power, and she cannot leave her home. Mr. Electric seemingly kills Sharkboy by fooling him into jumping into water filled with electric eels, which are his weakness, with Lavagirl sacrificing herself by jumping into the water to retrieve Sharkboy. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream. Just then, Sharkboy regains consciousness and races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer and defeats Minus, then offers to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, to which Minus agrees.\n\nMinus offers Mr. Electric to return to running Planet Drool, but Mr. Electric reveals that he never enjoyed doing so in the first place. He also informs Max that he made a terrible mistake of dreaming him up and flies to Earth to kill Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric emerges from the tornado before Max and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents are caught in the storm as well, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to freeze and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his parents.\n\nMax later informs his class that Planet Drool has become a proper dreamworld once again, Sharkboy became the King of the Ocean, and Lavagirl became Queen of the Volcanoes, and as the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class to \"dream a better dream, and work to make it real\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Max.

Max's father is an unemployed writer. They are on the brink of a divorce. They mean well for Max, but are unable to settle his troubles.

Mr. Electricidad is Max's teacher. Mr. Electric is Planet Drool's corrupt electrician. Tobor is an unfinished robot of Max that resided in the Dream Graveyard.

He is a bully at Max's school and steals his Dream Journal. With it, he enters Max's dreamworld and, using the name \"Minus\" (a nickname bestowed by Mr. Electricidad for Linus' habit of disliked conduct), alters it to his version before ultimately befriending Max.\n* [[Sasha Pieterse]] as Marissa Electricidad / Ice Princess. Marissa is the daughter of Mr. Electricidad, and at first the only student who befriends Max. On Planet Drool, she appears as the Ice Princess, the ruler of the Ice Kingdom and keeper of the Crystal Heart, which is a necklace she wears which can freeze anything including time.\n* [[Robert Rodriguez]] has a role voicing a shark. As seen in the credits, two of Robert Rodriguez's children, Rebel and Racer, portray Sharkboy at age five and age seven respectively. Rico Torres plays Sharkboy's father.

At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long-standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'', ''Spring Adventure'' etc). One of them, ''Thursday Adventure'' (1955) was filmed as ''[[The Stolen Airliner]]'' (1955).<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/pudney_john 'John Pudney' in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'']</ref> They featured classic illustrations by artists such as Ley Kenyon (1913-1990) and Douglas Relf.<ref>[https://www.aces-high.com/artists/view/ley-kenyon Aces High: Aviation Gallery]</ref> The later six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children were published by Hamish Hamilton.

Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney.

It is a [[sequel]] to Faulkner's early novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'', which introduced the characters of [[Temple Drake]], her friend (later husband) Gowan Stevens, and Gowan's uncle [[Gavin Stevens (Faulkner character)|Gavin Stevens]]. The events in ''Requiem'' are set in Faulkner's fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], in November 1937 and March 1938, eight years after the events of ''Sanctuary''. In ''Requiem'', Temple, now married with a child, must learn to deal with her violent, turbulent past as related in ''Sanctuary''.\n\n''Requiem'', originally published in book form, was later [[Requiem for a Nun (play)|adapted for the stage]]. It was also a co-source, along with ''Sanctuary'', for the 1961 film ''[[Sanctuary (1961 film)|Sanctuary]]''.\n\n==Form and theme==\nLike many of Faulkner's works, ''Requiem'' experiments with narrative technique; the book is part novel, part play. The main narrative, which is presented in dramatic form, is interspersed with prose sections recounting the history of the fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]]. Each prose section focuses on a specific institution (the courthouse, state house, and jailhouse respectively) that serves as the setting for the following dramatic section of the story.<ref name=critcomp>{{cite book |last1=Fargnoli |first1=A.

Eight years earlier, as described in ''Sanctuary'', Temple fell into the hands of a gang of violent [[rum-running|bootleggers]] and was raped and imprisoned in a [[brothel]] through the drunken irresponsibility of her escort, Gowan Stevens. Afterwards, Gowan married Temple out of a sense of honor and responsibility, and they had two children. The Stevenses have resumed their place in the respectable, well-to-do society of the county, and appear to have a normal life, but their marriage is strained by Temple's past and the unspoken idea that on some level, she enjoyed or got some excitement from her brothel experience. Temple hired Nancy, a black drug addict and occasional prostitute, in order to have someone to talk to who understood her.\n\nGowan's uncle Gavin Stevens, who is serving as Nancy's defense attorney, believes Temple is withholding information about her daughter's death, and confronts Temple outside the presence of her husband Gowan. Temple indicates that there were reasons why Nancy killed the baby, and that Nancy was neither mentally ill nor malicious, but avoids revealing any more information, instead going on an extended trip to California.\n\nSeveral months later, a week before Nancy's scheduled execution, Temple returns to Jefferson and contacts Gavin. After drugging her husband Gowan with a sleeping pill so he will not overhear the conversation, Temple confesses to Gavin that although Nancy did kill the baby, Temple herself also had a hand in the killing and wants to stop Nancy's execution. Gavin urges her to appeal directly to the [[Governor of Mississippi]], although it may be too late to save Nancy. Unbeknownst to Temple or Gavin, Gowan has overheard the entire conversation.\n\nThe day before Nancy's execution, Temple goes to the state capital, [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and confesses to the governor that prior to her baby's killing, she had planned to abandon her husband and family and run away with Pete, the younger brother of her former lover Red. As described in ''Sanctuary'', Temple as a 17-year-old virgin was brutally raped with a corncob by the impotent gangster [[Popeye (Faulkner character)|Popeye]], who then forced her repeatedly to have sex with Red while he watched. Temple began to fall in love with Red, causing the jealous Popeye to murder him. After being rescued, Temple falsely accused another man, Goodwin, of being her rapist, causing Goodwin to be lynched by an angry mob. Before Red's murder, Temple had written him explicit love letters, which were later found by his brother Pete, who used them to blackmail Temple. Temple found herself attracted to Pete and planned not only to give him a large sum of money, but also to elope with him. Upon learning that Temple was about to leave with Pete, Nancy attempted to stop her by smothering her baby daughter, an act that will also cost Nancy her own life as well, which Nancy is willing to sacrifice.\n\nThe governor has already refused to grant clemency for Nancy. Although Temple believes she is confessing to the governor, he has left his office and Temple's husband Gowan is sitting in his chair, which Temple realizes only after she has finished telling her story. Gowan tells Temple he too is sorry for his part in triggering the chain of events that happened eight years ago, but that the past is unchangeable and over. Temple worries about the salvation of her own soul.\n\nOn the morning of Nancy's execution, Temple and Gavin visit her in her prison cell. Temple explains that she wanted to confess to the governor that Nancy was not solely responsible for the baby's death, and that she, Temple, caused the death eight years ago by going on the date with Gowan that led to her rape and the subsequent chain of events. Now Nancy must die for smothering the baby while Temple must live with the consequences of her own actions. Nancy tells Temple to trust in God and extols the virtues of suffering.\n\n==Development==\nFaulkner stated that initially he wished to end the plot at the end of ''Sanctuary'' but he decided that, in E. Pauline Degenfelder's words, \"Temple's reinterpretation would be dramatic and worthwhile.\"<ref name=Degenfelderp552>Degenfelder, p. 552.</ref> Degenfelder, from [[Worcester Public Schools]], believes that he may have gotten inspiration for the sequel from ''The Story of Temple Drake'' due to common elements between the two.<ref name=Degenfelderp552/>\n\n==Characterization==\nDegenfelder stated that the author formed, in Temple, \"an essentially different woman from the same base, without sensing any contradiction.\"<ref name=Degenfelderp553>Degenfelder, 553.</ref> According to the reviewer, this differs from the \"[[flat character|flat]]\" characterization to Temple in the novel.<ref name=Degenfelderp553/>\n\nThough Temple, in this novel, is formally known as \"Mrs. Gowan Stevens\", she still calls herself by her [[maiden name]]. Phillips stated that internally she still perceives herself to be \"an irresponsible adolescent\" and undeserving of a reputation of being a responsible wife.<ref name=PhillipsFictionp82>Phillips, Gene D.

It is a [[sequel]] to Faulkner's early novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'', which introduced the characters of [[Temple Drake]], her friend (later husband) Gowan Stevens, and Gowan's uncle [[Gavin Stevens (Faulkner character)|Gavin Stevens]]. The events in ''Requiem'' are set in Faulkner's fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], in November 1937 and March 1938, eight years after the events of ''Sanctuary''. In ''Requiem'', Temple, now married with a child, must learn to deal with her violent, turbulent past as related in ''Sanctuary''.\n\n''Requiem'', originally published in book form, was later [[Requiem for a Nun (play)|adapted for the stage]]. It was also a co-source, along with ''Sanctuary'', for the 1961 film ''[[Sanctuary (1961 film)|Sanctuary]]''.\n\n==Form and theme==\nLike many of Faulkner's works, ''Requiem'' experiments with narrative technique; the book is part novel, part play. The main narrative, which is presented in dramatic form, is interspersed with prose sections recounting the history of the fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]]. Each prose section focuses on a specific institution (the courthouse, state house, and jailhouse respectively) that serves as the setting for the following dramatic section of the story.<ref name=critcomp>{{cite book |last1=Fargnoli |first1=A.

Eight years earlier, as described in ''Sanctuary'', Temple fell into the hands of a gang of violent [[rum-running|bootleggers]] and was raped and imprisoned in a [[brothel]] through the drunken irresponsibility of her escort, Gowan Stevens. Afterwards, Gowan married Temple out of a sense of honor and responsibility, and they had two children. The Stevenses have resumed their place in the respectable, well-to-do society of the county, and appear to have a normal life, but their marriage is strained by Temple's past and the unspoken idea that on some level, she enjoyed or got some excitement from her brothel experience. Temple hired Nancy, a black drug addict and occasional prostitute, in order to have someone to talk to who understood her.\n\nGowan's uncle [[Gavin Stevens (Faulkner character)|Gavin Stevens]], who is serving as Nancy's defense attorney, believes Temple is withholding information about her daughter's death, and confronts Temple outside the presence of her husband Gowan. Temple indicates that there were reasons why Nancy killed the baby, and that Nancy was neither mentally ill nor malicious, but avoids revealing any more information, instead going on an extended trip to California.\n\nSeveral months later, a week before Nancy's scheduled execution, Temple returns to Jefferson and contacts Gavin. After drugging her husband Gowan with a sleeping pill so he will not overhear the conversation, Temple confesses to Gavin that although Nancy did kill the baby, Temple herself also had a hand in the killing and wants to stop Nancy's execution. Gavin urges her to appeal directly to the [[Governor of Mississippi]], although it may be too late to save Nancy. Unbeknownst to Temple or Gavin, Gowan has overheard the entire conversation.\n\nThe day before Nancy's execution, Temple goes to the state capitol, [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and confesses to the governor that prior to her baby's killing, she had planned to abandon her husband and family and run away with Pete, the younger brother of her former lover Red. As described in ''Sanctuary'', Temple as a 17-year-old virgin was brutally raped with a corncob by the impotent gangster [[Popeye (Faulkner character)|Popeye]], who then forced her repeatedly to have sex with Red while he watched. Temple began to fall in love with Red, causing the jealous Popeye to murder him. After being rescued, Temple falsely accused another man, Goodwin, of being her rapist, causing Goodwin to be lynched by an angry mob. Before Red's murder, Temple had written him explicit love letters, which were later found by his brother Pete, who used them to blackmail Temple. Temple found herself attracted to Pete and planned not only to give him a large sum of money, but also to elope with him. Upon learning that Temple was about to leave with Pete, Nancy attempted to stop her by smothering her baby daughter, an act that will also cost Nancy her own life as well, which Nancy is willing to sacrifice.\n\nThe governor has already refused to grant clemency for Nancy. Although Temple believes she is confessing to the governor, he has left his office and Temple's husband Gowan is sitting in his chair, which Temple realizes only after she has finished telling her story. Gowan tells Temple he too is sorry for his part in triggering the chain of events that happened eight years ago, but that the past is unchangeable and over. Temple worries about the salvation of her own soul.\n\nOn the morning of Nancy's execution, Temple and Gavin visit her in her prison cell. Temple explains that she wanted to confess to the governor that Nancy was not solely responsible for the baby's death, and that she, Temple, caused the death eight years ago by going on the date with Gowan that led to her rape and the subsequent chain of events. Now Nancy must die for smothering the baby while Temple must live with the consequences of her own actions. Nancy tells Temple to trust in God and extols the virtues of suffering.\n\n==Development==\nFaulkner stated that initially he wished to end the plot at the end of ''Sanctuary'' but he decided that, in E. Pauline Degenfelder's words, \"Temple's reinterpretation would be dramatic and worthwhile.\"<ref name=Degenfelderp552>Degenfelder, p. 552.</ref> Degenfelder, from [[Worcester Public Schools]], believes that he may have gotten inspiration for the sequel from ''The Story of Temple Drake'' due to common elements between the two.<ref name=Degenfelderp552/>\n\n==Characterization==\nDegenfelder stated that the author formed, in Temple, \"an essentially different woman from the same base, without sensing any contradiction.\"<ref name=Degenfelderp553>Degenfelder, 553.</ref> According to the reviewer, this differs from the \"[[flat character|flat]]\" characterization to Temple in the novel.<ref name=Degenfelderp553/>\n\nThough Temple, in this novel, is formally known as \"Mrs. Gowan Stevens\", she still calls herself by her [[maiden name]]. Phillips stated that internally she still perceives herself to be \"an irresponsible adolescent\" and undeserving of a reputation of being a responsible wife.<ref name=PhillipsFictionp82>Phillips, Gene D.
