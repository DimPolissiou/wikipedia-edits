(2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. <blockquote>\"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Keeping in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality, this example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":0\" /> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements.<blockquote>\"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items (Kroger, 2005). We can think of a lexical entry analogously to a dictionary entry. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic, if not also other grammatical information such as irregular forms or patterns associated with that specific word (Kroger, 2005). Phonological features indicate pronunciation information and whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicate syntactic category labels, otherwise known as parts of speech. Finally, semantic features indicate meaning. In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied by each head in order to create a well formed sentence. For example, a partial lexical entry for the English noun ''dog'' has been illustrated below (Kroger, 2005). \n\n\n''dog'' /d\u00f4g/<br>\n\n'a domesticated carnivorous mammal, typically found with four legs\"<br>\n\n<sub>CAT</sub>: N<br>\n\n[+count]<br>\n\n<sub>PLURAL</sub>: ''dogs''\n\n\n\n===Argument Structure===\nArgument structure is the list of selected arguments associated with a lexical category, such as a verb (SKS, 2015). When every predicate, otherwise known as a verb, is used, it selects a specific set of arguments that need to be fulfilled to create a well-formed sentence (Kroger, 2005). These are arguments such as <small>AGENT</small>, <small>PATIENT</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>RECIPIENT</small>, and <small>STIMULUS</small>. To illustrate this, the sentence ''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa'', has been broken down into its semantic roles and argument selections below. \n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry.\n\n===Thematic Roles and S-Selection===\n''Theta roles'' identify the meaning relation between the constituent and the selected predicate (SKS 2015). There are eight theta roles: <small>AGENT</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>CAUSE</small>, <small>POSSESSOR</small>, <small>LOCATION</small>,<small>GOAL</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, and <small>BENEFICIARY</small>. Each term indicates the relationship between the verb, predicate, and one of its arguments. This is what is called ''s-selection'', a shortening of semantic selection. S-Selection is an important addition to any lexical entry in order to make them easier to interpret (SKS 2015). It is important to understand that, according to the ''Theta Criterion'', every argument bears one and only one theta role (Chomsky, 1965). Below is an example for each theta role (SKS 2015):\n\n<small>CAUSE</small>: a cause; ''The dog bit the child. This made him cry''\n\n\n<small>AGENT</small>: a person on entity which intentionally is causing or doing something; ''Joshua intentionally hit him''\n\n\n<small>EXPERIENCER</small>: a sentient being inside of, or acquiring, a psychological state; ''Sam hates cats/Josh noticed Alice''\n\n\n<small>LOCATION</small>: a location; ''Marianne leaped through the field''\n\n\n<small>GOAL</small>: a location/being that is the endpoint; ''Moses gave Josh a toothbrush''\n\n\n<small>BENEFICIARY</small>: a beneficiary; ''Susie made cookies for Sarah''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSOR</small>: a possessor; ''Shelly owns cats''\n<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small>: what is possessed; ''Shelly's cats''\n*<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small> is a subset of <small>POSSESSOR</small> which is why it has been included but not given its own role\n\n\n<small>THEME</small>: something that undergoes a change, such as location change, or any kind of progression;''Josie sent Riven cookies/''\n*<small>THEME</small> is also commonly used for things that do not fit any other theta role, such as ''Josie is short'' or ''Sarah said that it is foggy''\n\n==Verbs==\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n\n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.<ref>For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).</ref> Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.<ref>For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).</ref> Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.</ref> In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Lexical item]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n* Bennet, P. 1995.

The reason that there are different types is that even diamond can be found in two crystalline polytypes. The more common one has its carbon atoms arranged in a [[cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]], while the less common one, [[lonsdaleite]], has a [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal lattice]]. By mixing these polytypes in various ways at the nanoscale level of structure, DLC coatings can be made that at the same time are amorphous, flexible, and yet purely sp<sup>3</sup> bonded \"diamond\". The hardest, strongest, and slickest is such a mixture, known as '''tetrahedral amorphous carbon''' (ta-C). {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} For example a coating of only 2 \u03bcm thickness of ''ta-C'' increases the resistance of common (e.g., type 304) [[stainless steel]] against abrasive wear, changing its lifetime in such service from one week to 85 years. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Such ''ta-C'' can be considered to be the \"pure\" form of DLC, since it consists only of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms.

''Physical Review'' Letters, 2011</ref>\n\n==Distinction from natural and synthetic diamond==\nNaturally occurring diamond is almost always found in the crystalline form with a purely [[cubic crystal system|cubic orientation]] of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms. Sometimes there are lattice defects or inclusions of atoms of other elements that give color to the stone, but the lattice arrangement of the carbons remains cubic and bonding is purely sp<sup>3</sup>. The internal energy of the cubic polytype is slightly lower than that of the [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] and growth rates from molten material in both natural and bulk [[synthetic diamond]] production methods are slow enough that the lattice structure has time to grow in the lowest energy (cubic) form that is possible for sp<sup>3</sup> bonding of carbon atoms. In contrast, DLC is typically produced by processes in which high energy precursive carbons (e.g. in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], in filtered [[cathodic arc deposition]], in [[sputter deposition]] and in [[ion beam deposition]]) are rapidly cooled or quenched on relatively cold surfaces. In those cases cubic and hexagonal lattices can be randomly intermixed, layer by atomic layer, because there is no time available for one of the crystalline geometries to grow at the expense of the other before the atoms are \"frozen\" in place in the material. [[Amorphous]] DLC coatings can result in materials that have no long-range crystalline order. Without long range order there are no brittle fracture planes, so such coatings are flexible and conformal to the underlying shape being coated, while still being as hard as diamond. In fact this property has been exploited to study atom-by-atom wear at the nanoscale in DLC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=14827.php|title=Achieving ultralow nanoscale wear of one atom per micrometer|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Ta C structure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a gold-coated replica of a ta-C \"diamond-like\" coating. Structural elements are not crystallites but are nodules of sp<sup>3</sup>-bonded carbon atoms. The grains are so small that the surface appears mirror smooth to the eye.]]\n\nThere are several methods producing DLC, which rely on the lower density of sp<sup>2</sup> than sp<sup>3</sup> carbon. So the application of pressure, impact, [[catalysis]], or some combination of these at the atomic scale can force sp<sup>2</sup> bonded carbon atoms closer together into sp<sup>3</sup> bonds. This must be done vigorously enough that the atoms cannot simply spring back apart into separations characteristic of sp<sup>2</sup> bonds. Usually techniques either combine such a compression with a push of the new cluster of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon deeper into the coating so that there is no room for expansion back to separations needed for sp<sup>2</sup> bonding; or the new cluster is buried by the arrival of new carbon destined for the next cycle of impacts. It is reasonable to envisage the process as a \"hail\" of projectiles that produce localized, faster, [[Nanotechnology|nanoscale]] versions of the classic combinations of heat and pressure that produce natural and synthetic diamond. Because they occur independently at many places across the surface of a growing film or coating, they tend to produce an analog of a [[cobblestone]] street with the cobbles being nodules or clusters of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon. Depending upon the particular \"recipe\" being used, there are cycles of deposition of carbon and impact or continuous proportions of new carbon arriving and projectiles conveying the impacts needed to force the formation of the sp<sup>3</sup> bonds. As a result, ''ta-C'' may have the structure of a cobblestone street, or the nodules may \"melt together\" to make something more like a [[sponge]] or the cobbles may be so small as to be nearly invisible to imaging. A classic \"medium\" morphology for a ''ta-C'' film is shown in the figure.\n\n==Properties==\nAs implied by the name, diamond-like carbon (DLC), the value of such coatings accrues from their ability to provide some of the properties of diamond to surfaces of almost any material. The primary desirable qualities are hardness, wear resistance, and slickness (DLC film [[friction coefficient]] against polished steel ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richterprecision.com/dlc-coatings.html|title=DLC Coatings - Diamond-Like Carbon Coatings - Titankote - HIPIMS technology|website=www.richterprecision.com}}</ref>).

In 2006 the Association of German Engineers, [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]], the largest engineering association in Western Europe issued an authoritative report VDI2840 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vdi.de/vdi/presse/mitteilungen_details/index.php?ID=1015889|title=Pressemitteilungen|access-date=2006-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528112631/http://www.vdi.de/vdi/presse/mitteilungen_details/index.php?ID=1015889|archive-date=2007-05-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> in order to clarify the existing multiplicity of confusing terms and trade names. It provides a unique classification and nomenclature for diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and diamond films. It succeeded in reporting all information necessary to identify and to compare different DLC films which are offered on the market. Quoting from that document:<blockquote>These [sp<sup>3</sup>] bonds can occur not only with crystals - in other words, in solids with long-range order - but also in amorphous solids where the atoms are in a random arrangement. In this case there will be bonding only between a few individual atoms and not in a long-range order extending over a large number of atoms. The bond types have a considerable influence on the material properties of amorphous carbon films. If the sp<sup>2</sup> type is predominant the film will be softer, if the sp<sup>3</sup> type is predominant the film will be harder.</blockquote> A secondary determinant of quality was found to be the fractional content of hydrogen. Some of the production methods involve hydrogen or [[methane]] as a catalyst and a considerable percentage of hydrogen can remain in the finished DLC material. When it is recalled that the soft plastic, [[polyethylene]] is made from carbon that is bonded purely by the diamond-like sp<sup>3</sup> bonds, but also includes chemically bonded hydrogen, it is not surprising to learn that fractions of hydrogen remaining in DLC films degrade them almost as much as do residues of sp<sup>2</sup> bonded carbon. The VDI2840 report confirmed the utility of locating a particular DLC material onto a 2-dimensional map on which the X-axis described the fraction of hydrogen in the material and the Y-axis described the fraction of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms. The highest quality of diamond-like properties was affirmed to be correlated with the proximity of the map [[point plotting]] the (X,Y) coordinates of a particular material to the upper left corner at (0,1), namely 0% hydrogen and 100% sp<sup>3</sup> bonding. That \"pure\" DLC material is ''ta-C'' and others are approximations that are degraded by diluents such as hydrogen, sp<sup>2</sup> bonded carbon, and metals. Valuable properties of materials that are ''ta-C'', or nearly ''ta-C'' follow.\n\n===Hardness===\n[[Image:Ta C wear (original).jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning Tunneling Microscope|STM]] image of surfaces at the edge of a 1 \u03bcm thick layer of ''ta-C'' \"diamond-like\" coating on 304 stainless steel after various durations of tumbling in a slurry of 240 mesh SiC abrasive. The first 100 min shows a burnishing away from the coating of an overburden of soft carbons than had been deposited after the last cycle of impacts converted bonds to sp<sup>3</sup>. On the uncoated part of the sample, about 5 \u03bcm of steel were removed during subsequent tumbling while the coating completely protected the part of the sample it covered.]]\n\nWithin the \"cobblestones\", nodules, clusters, or \"sponges\" (the volumes in which local bonding is sp<sup>3</sup>) bond angles may be distorted from those found in either pure cubic or hexagonal lattices because of intermixing of the two. The result is internal (compressive) stress that can appear to add to the hardness measured for a sample of DLC. Hardness is often measured by [[nanoindentation]] methods in which a finely pointed stylus of natural diamond is forced into the surface of a specimen. If the sample is so thin that there is only a single layer of nodules, then the stylus may enter the DLC layer between the hard cobblestones and push them apart without sensing the hardness of the sp<sup>3</sup> bonded volumes. Measurements would be low. Conversely, if the probing stylus enters a film thick enough to have several layers of nodules so it cannot be spread laterally, or if it enters on top of a cobblestone in a single layer, then it will measure not only the real hardness of the diamond bonding, but an apparent hardness even greater because the internal compressive stress in those nodules would provide further resistance to penetration of the material by the stylus. [[Nanoindentation]] measurements have reported hardness as great as 50% more than values for natural crystalline diamond. Since the stylus is blunted in such cases or even broken, actual numbers for hardness that exceed that of natural diamond are meaningless. They only show that the hard parts of an optimal ''ta-C'' material will break natural diamond rather than the inverse. Nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint it does not matter how the resistance of a DLC material is developed, it can be harder than natural diamond in usage. One method of testing the coating hardness is by means of the [[Persoz pendulum]].\n\n===Bonding of DLC coatings===\nThe same internal stress that benefits the hardness of DLC materials makes it difficult to bond such coatings to the substrates to be protected. The internal stresses try to \"pop\" the DLC coatings off of the underlying samples. This challenging downside of extreme hardness is answered in several ways, depending upon the particular \"art\" of the production process. The most simple is to exploit the natural chemical bonding that happens in cases in which incident carbon ions supply the material to be impacted into sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms and the impacting energies that are compressing carbon volumes condensed earlier. In this case the first carbon ions will impact the surface of the item to be coated. If that item is made of a [[carbide]]-forming substance such as [[titanium|Ti]] or [[iron|Fe]] in [[steel]] a layer of carbide will be formed that is later bonded to the DLC grown on top of it. Other methods of bonding include such strategies as depositing intermediate layers that have atomic spacings that grade from those of the substrate to those characteristic of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon. In 2006 there were as many successful recipes for bonding DLC coatings as there were sources of DLC.\n\n===Tribology===\nDLC coatings are often used to prevent wear due to their excellent [[tribology|tribological]] properties. DLC is very resistant to abrasive and adhesive wear making it suitable for use in applications that experience extreme contact pressure, both in rolling and sliding contact. DLC is often used to prevent wear on razor blades and metal cutting tools, including lathe inserts and [[milling cutter]]s. DLC is used in [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[cam]]s, cam followers, and shafts in the automobile industry. The coatings reduce wear during the 'break-in' period, where drive train components may be starved for [[lubrication]].\n\nDLCs may also be used in [[chameleon coating]]s that are designed to prevent wear during launch, orbit, and re-entry of land-launched space vehicles. DLC provides lubricity at ambient atmosphere and at vacuum unlike graphite, which requires moisture to be lubricious. Isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings are the recent development <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.triboint.2017.04.008 | volume=114 | title=A preliminary wear studies of isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings | journal=Tribology International | pages=42\u201347| year=2017 | last1=Zia | first1=Abdul Wasy | last2=Zhou | first2=Zhifeng | last3=Li | first3=Lawrence Kwok-Yan }}</ref> in this area. The wear rate of amorphous DLC can be reduced up to 60% by embedding isolated carbon nanoparticles embedded simultaneous to DLC deposition. The isolated particles were in-situ created through rapid plasma quenching with Helium pulses.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.diamond.2017.04.014 | volume=76 | title=A new approach to create isolated carbon particles by sputtering: A detailed parametric study and a concept of carbon particles embedded carbon coatings | journal=Tribology International | pages=97\u2013107| year=2017 | last1=Zia | first1=Abdul Wasy | last2=Zhou | first2=Zhifeng | last3=Li | first3=Lawrence Kwok-Yan }}</ref>\n\nDespite the favorable tribological properties of DLC it must be used with caution on ferrous metals. If it is used at higher temperatures, the substrate or counter face may [[Carburization|carburize]], which could lead to loss of function due to a change in hardness. The final, end use temperature of a coated component should be kept below the temperature at which a PVC DLC coating is applied.\n\n===Electrical===\nIf a DLC material is close enough to ''ta-C'' on plots of bonding ratios and hydrogen content it can be an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] with a high value of resistivity. Perhaps more interesting is that if prepared in the \"medium\" cobblestone version such as shown in the above figure, electricity is passed through it by a mechanism of hopping [[Electrical conduction|conductivity]]. In this type of conduction of electricity the electrons move by [[quantum mechanical tunneling]] between pockets of conductive material isolated in an insulator. The result is that such a process makes the material something like a [[semiconductor]]. Further research on electrical properties is needed to explicate such conductivity in ''ta-C'' in order to determine its practical value. However, a different electrical property of [[Field electron emission|emissivity]] has been shown to occur at unique levels for ''ta-C''. Such high values allow for electrons to be emitted from ''ta-C'' coated electrodes into vacuum or into other solids with application of modest levels of applied voltage. This has supported important advances in medical technology.\n\n==Applications==\nApplications of DLC typically utilize the ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as [[endmill]]s, [[drill bit]]s, [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s and [[Molding (process)|mold]]s often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, [[NASCAR]] vehicles, and as a coating on [[hard-disk]] platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against [[head crash]]es. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet shaving have the edges coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as [[potato chip]]s and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs with plastic wraps. DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the high-speed, dry shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and [[aluminium]], for example on automobile dashboards.\n\nThe wear, friction, and electrical properties of DLC make it an appealing material for medical applications. Fortunately, DLC has proved to have excellent bio-compatibility as well. This has enabled many medical procedures, such as [[Percutaneous coronary intervention]] employing [[brachytherapy]] to benefit from the unique electrical properties of DLC. At low voltages and low temperatures electrodes coated with DLC can emit enough electrons to be arranged into disposable, micro-X-ray tubes as small as the radioactive seeds that are introduced into arteries or tumors in conventional [[brachytherapy]]. The same dose of prescribed radiation can be applied ''from the inside, out'' with the additional possibility to switch on and off the radiation in the prescribed pattern for the X-rays being used. DLC has proved to be an excellent coating to prolong the life of and reduce complications with replacement hip joints and artificial knees. It also has been successfully applied to coronary artery stents, reducing the incidence of thrombosis. The implantable human heart pump can be considered the ultimate biomedical application where DLC coating is used on blood contacting surfaces of the key components of the device.\n\nThe Space Black stainless steel Apple Watch<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/watch/craftsmanship/|publisher=Apple Inc|title=Watch}}</ref> is coated with diamond-like carbon.\n\n==Environmental benefits of durable products==\nThe increase in lifetime of articles coated with DLC that wear out because of abrasion can be described by the formula ''f = (g)<sup>\u00b5</sup>'', where ''g'' is a number that characterizes the type of DLC, the type of abrasion, the substrate material and \u03bc is the thickness of the DLC coating in \u03bcm.<ref>{{cite journal|author= C.B.

These are measured values; though in the case of the 2 \u03bcm coating the lifetime was extrapolated from the last time the sample was evaluated until the testing apparatus itself wore out.\n\nThere are environmental arguments that a sustainable economy ought to encourage articles not engineered to lower performance or to fail prematurely. This in turn will reduce the need to support greater production of units and their frequent replacement, which might provide an economic disincentive to manufacturers of such devices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nCurrently there are about 100 outsource vendors of DLC coatings that are loaded with amounts of graphite and hydrogen and so give much lower g-numbers than 66 on the same substrates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chemical vapor deposition]]\n* [[Cathodic arc deposition]]\n* [[Poly(hydridocarbyne)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=623 \"Diamond-like carbon coatings\"] at AZo Materials\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081401/http://hafniumisomer.org/Refs.htm \"Selected Manuscripts we published on Noncrystalline Diamond Films\"]: Bibliography of early work on DLC\n* [https://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/31822/en \"Diamond-like tip better than the best\"]: Recent applications of DLC at the nanoscale (1 March 2010)\n\n[[Category:Carbon forms]]\n[[Category:Coatings]]\n[[Category:Superhard materials]]\n[[Category:Thin film deposition]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Class of amorphous carbon material}}\n[[Image:Tetrahedral amorphous carbon thin film.jpg|thumb|A ta-C thin film on silicon (15 mm diameter) exhibiting regions of 40 nm and 80 nm thickness.]]\n[[Image:Diamond-like carbon coated cobalt ball.jpg|thumb|A Co-alloy valve part from a producing oil well (30 mm diameter), coated on the right side with ''ta-C'', in order to test for added resistance to chemical and abrasive degradation in the working environment.]]\n[[Image:Mpnvs-for-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Dome coated with DLC for optical and tribological purposes.]]\n\n'''Diamond-like carbon''' ('''DLC''') is a class of [[amorphous carbon]] material that displays some of the typical properties of [[diamond]].

''Physical Review'' Letters, 2011</ref>\n\n==Distinction from natural and synthetic diamond==\nNaturally occurring diamond is almost always found in the crystalline form with a purely [[cubic crystal system|cubic orientation]] of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms. Sometimes there are lattice defects or inclusions of atoms of other elements that give color to the stone, but the lattice arrangement of the carbons remains cubic and bonding is purely sp<sup>3</sup>. The internal energy of the cubic polytype is slightly lower than that of the [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] and growth rates from molten material in both natural and bulk [[synthetic diamond]] production methods are slow enough that the lattice structure has time to grow in the lowest energy (cubic) form that is possible for sp<sup>3</sup> bonding of carbon atoms. In contrast, DLC is typically produced by processes in which high energy precursive carbons (e.g. in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], in filtered [[cathodic arc deposition]], in [[sputter deposition]] and in [[ion beam deposition]]) are rapidly cooled or quenched on relatively cold surfaces. In those cases cubic and hexagonal lattices can be randomly intermixed, layer by atomic layer, because there is no time available for one of the crystalline geometries to grow at the expense of the other before the atoms are \"frozen\" in place in the material. [[Amorphous]] DLC coatings can result in materials that have no long-range crystalline order. Without long range order there are no brittle fracture planes, so such coatings are flexible and conformal to the underlying shape being coated, while still being as hard as diamond. In fact this property has been exploited to study atom-by-atom wear at the nanoscale in DLC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=14827.php|title=Achieving ultralow nanoscale wear of one atom per micrometer|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Ta C structure.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a gold-coated replica of a ta-C \"diamond-like\" coating. Structural elements are not crystallites but are nodules of sp<sup>3</sup>-bonded carbon atoms. The grains are so small that the surface appears mirror smooth to the eye.]]\n\nThere are several methods producing DLC, which rely on the lower density of sp<sup>2</sup> than sp<sup>3</sup> carbon. So the application of pressure, impact, [[catalysis]], or some combination of these at the atomic scale can force sp<sup>2</sup> bonded carbon atoms closer together into sp<sup>3</sup> bonds. This must be done vigorously enough that the atoms cannot simply spring back apart into separations characteristic of sp<sup>2</sup> bonds. Usually techniques either combine such a compression with a push of the new cluster of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon deeper into the coating so that there is no room for expansion back to separations needed for sp<sup>2</sup> bonding; or the new cluster is buried by the arrival of new carbon destined for the next cycle of impacts. It is reasonable to envisage the process as a \"hail\" of projectiles that produce localized, faster, [[Nanotechnology|nanoscale]] versions of the classic combinations of heat and pressure that produce natural and synthetic diamond. Because they occur independently at many places across the surface of a growing film or coating, they tend to produce an analog of a [[cobblestone]] street with the cobbles being nodules or clusters of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon. Depending upon the particular \"recipe\" being used, there are cycles of deposition of carbon and impact or continuous proportions of new carbon arriving and projectiles conveying the impacts needed to force the formation of the sp<sup>3</sup> bonds. As a result, ''ta-C'' may have the structure of a cobblestone street, or the nodules may \"melt together\" to make something more like a [[sponge]] or the cobbles may be so small as to be nearly invisible to imaging. A classic \"medium\" morphology for a ''ta-C'' film is shown in the figure.\n\n==Properties==\nAs implied by the name, diamond-like carbon (DLC), the value of such coatings accrues from their ability to provide some of the properties of diamond to surfaces of almost any material. The primary desirable qualities are hardness, wear resistance, and slickness (DLC film [[friction coefficient]] against polished steel ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richterprecision.com/dlc-coatings.html|title=DLC Coatings - Diamond-Like Carbon Coatings - Titankote - HIPIMS technology|website=www.richterprecision.com}}</ref>).

In 2006 the Association of German Engineers, [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]], the largest engineering association in Western Europe issued an authoritative report VDI2840 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vdi.de/vdi/presse/mitteilungen_details/index.php?ID=1015889|title=Pressemitteilungen|access-date=2006-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528112631/http://www.vdi.de/vdi/presse/mitteilungen_details/index.php?ID=1015889|archive-date=2007-05-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> in order to clarify the existing multiplicity of confusing terms and trade names. It provides a unique classification and nomenclature for diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and diamond films. It succeeded in reporting all information necessary to identify and to compare different DLC films which are offered on the market. Quoting from that document:<blockquote>These [sp<sup>3</sup>] bonds can occur not only with crystals - in other words, in solids with long-range order - but also in amorphous solids where the atoms are in a random arrangement. In this case there will be bonding only between a few individual atoms and not in a long-range order extending over a large number of atoms. The bond types have a considerable influence on the material properties of amorphous carbon films. If the sp<sup>2</sup> type is predominant the film will be softer, if the sp<sup>3</sup> type is predominant the film will be harder.</blockquote> A secondary determinant of quality was found to be the fractional content of hydrogen. Some of the production methods involve hydrogen or [[methane]] as a catalyst and a considerable percentage of hydrogen can remain in the finished DLC material. When it is recalled that the soft plastic, [[polyethylene]] is made from carbon that is bonded purely by the diamond-like sp<sup>3</sup> bonds, but also includes chemically bonded hydrogen, it is not surprising to learn that fractions of hydrogen remaining in DLC films degrade them almost as much as do residues of sp<sup>2</sup> bonded carbon. The VDI2840 report confirmed the utility of locating a particular DLC material onto a 2-dimensional map on which the X-axis described the fraction of hydrogen in the material and the Y-axis described the fraction of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms. The highest quality of diamond-like properties was affirmed to be correlated with the proximity of the map [[point plotting]] the (X,Y) coordinates of a particular material to the upper left corner at (0,1), namely 0% hydrogen and 100% sp<sup>3</sup> bonding. That \"pure\" DLC material is ''ta-C'' and others are approximations that are degraded by diluents such as hydrogen, sp<sup>2</sup> bonded carbon, and metals. Valuable properties of materials that are ''ta-C'', or nearly ''ta-C'' follow.\n\n===Hardness===\n[[Image:Ta C wear (original).jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning Tunneling Microscope|STM]] image of surfaces at the edge of a 1 \u03bcm thick layer of ''ta-C'' \"diamond-like\" coating on 304 stainless steel after various durations of tumbling in a slurry of 240 mesh SiC abrasive. The first 100 min shows a burnishing away from the coating of an overburden of soft carbons than had been deposited after the last cycle of impacts converted bonds to sp<sup>3</sup>. On the uncoated part of the sample, about 5 \u03bcm of steel were removed during subsequent tumbling while the coating completely protected the part of the sample it covered.]]\n\nWithin the \"cobblestones\", nodules, clusters, or \"sponges\" (the volumes in which local bonding is sp<sup>3</sup>) bond angles may be distorted from those found in either pure cubic or hexagonal lattices because of intermixing of the two. The result is internal (compressive) stress that can appear to add to the hardness measured for a sample of DLC. Hardness is often measured by [[nanoindentation]] methods in which a finely pointed stylus of natural diamond is forced into the surface of a specimen. If the sample is so thin that there is only a single layer of nodules, then the stylus may enter the DLC layer between the hard cobblestones and push them apart without sensing the hardness of the sp<sup>3</sup> bonded volumes. Measurements would be low. Conversely, if the probing stylus enters a film thick enough to have several layers of nodules so it cannot be spread laterally, or if it enters on top of a cobblestone in a single layer, then it will measure not only the real hardness of the diamond bonding, but an apparent hardness even greater because the internal compressive stress in those nodules would provide further resistance to penetration of the material by the stylus. [[Nanoindentation]] measurements have reported hardness as great as 50% more than values for natural crystalline diamond. Since the stylus is blunted in such cases or even broken, actual numbers for hardness that exceed that of natural diamond are meaningless. They only show that the hard parts of an optimal ''ta-C'' material will break natural diamond rather than the inverse. Nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint it does not matter how the resistance of a DLC material is developed, it can be harder than natural diamond in usage. One method of testing the coating hardness is by means of the [[Persoz pendulum]].\n\n===Bonding of DLC coatings===\nThe same internal stress that benefits the hardness of DLC materials makes it difficult to bond such coatings to the substrates to be protected. The internal stresses try to \"pop\" the DLC coatings off of the underlying samples. This challenging downside of extreme hardness is answered in several ways, depending upon the particular \"art\" of the production process. The most simple is to exploit the natural chemical bonding that happens in cases in which incident carbon ions supply the material to be impacted into sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon atoms and the impacting energies that are compressing carbon volumes condensed earlier. In this case the first carbon ions will impact the surface of the item to be coated. If that item is made of a [[carbide]]-forming substance such as [[titanium|Ti]] or [[iron|Fe]] in [[steel]] a layer of carbide will be formed that is later bonded to the DLC grown on top of it. Other methods of bonding include such strategies as depositing intermediate layers that have atomic spacings that grade from those of the substrate to those characteristic of sp<sup>3</sup> bonded carbon. In 2006 there were as many successful recipes for bonding DLC coatings as there were sources of DLC.\n\n===Tribology===\nDLC coatings are often used to prevent wear due to their excellent [[tribology|tribological]] properties. DLC is very resistant to abrasive and adhesive wear making it suitable for use in applications that experience extreme contact pressure, both in rolling and sliding contact. DLC is often used to prevent wear on razor blades and metal cutting tools, including lathe inserts and [[milling cutter]]s. DLC is used in [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[cam]]s, cam followers, and shafts in the automobile industry. The coatings reduce wear during the 'break-in' period, where drive train components may be starved for [[lubrication]].\n\nDLCs may also be used in [[chameleon coating]]s that are designed to prevent wear during launch, orbit, and re-entry of land-launched space vehicles. DLC provides lubricity at ambient atmosphere and at vacuum unlike graphite, which requires moisture to be lubricious. Isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings are the recent development <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.triboint.2017.04.008 | volume=114 | title=A preliminary wear studies of isolated carbon particles embedded diamond-like carbon coatings | journal=Tribology International | pages=42\u201347| year=2017 | last1=Zia | first1=Abdul Wasy | last2=Zhou | first2=Zhifeng | last3=Li | first3=Lawrence Kwok-Yan }}</ref> in this area. The wear rate of amorphous DLC can be reduced up to 60% by embedding isolated carbon nanoparticles embedded simultaneous to DLC deposition. The isolated particles were in-situ created through rapid plasma quenching with Helium pulses.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.diamond.2017.04.014 | volume=76 | title=A new approach to create isolated carbon particles by sputtering: A detailed parametric study and a concept of carbon particles embedded carbon coatings | journal=Tribology International | pages=97\u2013107| year=2017 | last1=Zia | first1=Abdul Wasy | last2=Zhou | first2=Zhifeng | last3=Li | first3=Lawrence Kwok-Yan }}</ref>\n\nDespite the favorable tribological properties of DLC it must be used with caution on ferrous metals. If it is used at higher temperatures, the substrate or counter face may [[Carburization|carburize]], which could lead to loss of function due to a change in hardness. The final, end use temperature of a coated component should be kept below the temperature at which a PVC DLC coating is applied.\n\n===Electrical===\nIf a DLC material is close enough to ''ta-C'' on plots of bonding ratios and hydrogen content it can be an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] with a high value of resistivity. Perhaps more interesting is that if prepared in the \"medium\" cobblestone version such as shown in the above figure, electricity is passed through it by a mechanism of hopping [[Electrical conduction|conductivity]]. In this type of conduction of electricity the electrons move by [[quantum mechanical tunneling]] between pockets of conductive material isolated in an insulator. The result is that such a process makes the material something like a [[semiconductor]]. Further research on electrical properties is needed to explicate such conductivity in ''ta-C'' in order to determine its practical value. However, a different electrical property of [[Field electron emission|emissivity]] has been shown to occur at unique levels for ''ta-C''. Such high values allow for electrons to be emitted from ''ta-C'' coated electrodes into vacuum or into other solids with application of modest levels of applied voltage. This has supported important advances in medical technology.\n\n==Applications==\nApplications of DLC typically utilize the ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as [[endmill]]s, [[drill bit]]s, [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s and [[mold]]s often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, [[NASCAR]] vehicles, and as a coating on [[hard-disk]] platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against [[head crash]]es. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet shaving have the edges coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as [[potato chip]]s and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs with plastic wraps. DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the high-speed, dry shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and [[aluminium]], for example on automobile dashboards.\n\nThe wear, friction, and electrical properties of DLC make it an appealing material for medical applications. Fortunately, DLC has proved to have excellent bio-compatibility as well. This has enabled many medical procedures, such as [[Percutaneous coronary intervention]] employing [[brachytherapy]] to benefit from the unique electrical properties of DLC. At low voltages and low temperatures electrodes coated with DLC can emit enough electrons to be arranged into disposable, micro-X-ray tubes as small as the radioactive seeds that are introduced into arteries or tumors in conventional [[brachytherapy]]. The same dose of prescribed radiation can be applied ''from the inside, out'' with the additional possibility to switch on and off the radiation in the prescribed pattern for the X-rays being used. DLC has proved to be an excellent coating to prolong the life of and reduce complications with replacement hip joints and artificial knees. It also has been successfully applied to coronary artery stents, reducing the incidence of thrombosis. The implantable human heart pump can be considered the ultimate biomedical application where DLC coating is used on blood contacting surfaces of the key components of the device.\n\nThe Space Black stainless steel Apple Watch<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/watch/craftsmanship/|publisher=Apple Inc|title=Watch}}</ref> is coated with diamond-like carbon.\n\n==Environmental benefits of durable products==\nThe increase in lifetime of articles coated with DLC that wear out because of abrasion can be described by the formula ''f = (g)<sup>\u00b5</sup>'', where ''g'' is a number that characterizes the type of DLC, the type of abrasion, the substrate material and \u03bc is the thickness of the DLC coating in \u03bcm.<ref>{{cite journal|author= C.B.

These are measured values; though in the case of the 2 \u03bcm coating the lifetime was extrapolated from the last time the sample was evaluated until the testing apparatus itself wore out.\n\nThere are environmental arguments that a sustainable economy ought to encourage articles not engineered to lower performance or to fail prematurely. This in turn will reduce the need to support greater production of units and their frequent replacement, which might provide an economic disincentive to manufacturers of such devices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nCurrently there are about 100 outsource vendors of DLC coatings that are loaded with amounts of graphite and hydrogen and so give much lower g-numbers than 66 on the same substrates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chemical vapor deposition]]\n* [[Cathodic arc deposition]]\n* [[Poly(hydridocarbyne)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=623 \"Diamond-like carbon coatings\"] at AZo Materials\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081401/http://hafniumisomer.org/Refs.htm \"Selected Manuscripts we published on Noncrystalline Diamond Films\"]: Bibliography of early work on DLC\n* [https://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/31822/en \"Diamond-like tip better than the best\"]: Recent applications of DLC at the nanoscale (1 March 2010)\n\n[[Category:Carbon forms]]\n[[Category:Coatings]]\n[[Category:Superhard materials]]\n[[Category:Thin film deposition]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMolding (process)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-like_carbon"}

[[Bombardier Aerospace]].\n<!--Development-->\nAt the end of 1975, Canadair backed the LearStar 600 concept by [[Bill Lear]], and acquired the large business jet or freighter project in April 1976.<!--ref name=Upton2007--><!--ref name=Flight12aug1978-->\nOn 29 October, the programme was launched, backed by the [[Canadian federal government]], and designed to comply with new [[Federal

However, Lear lacked the capabilities to launch such an aircraft, and thus sought out other agencies to collaborate with to both produce and sell it, including the [[Canada|Canadian]] aerospace manufacturer [[Canadair]]. According to authors Ron Picklet and Larry Milberry, Canadair's top management were of the opinion that Lear's concept was sketchy at best.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\">Pickler, Ron and [[Larry Milberry]].

Canadair felt a need to prove its ability to independently develop original high-tech projects at this time.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nCanadair planned to use Lear's name and skills at self-promotion to secure extensive financial guarantees for a business jet project from the Canadian Federal government.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\"/> This proved an effective choice: future Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] specifically refers to the effect of personal contact with Lear on his decision to direct financial support to Canadair's program.<ref>Low, Stephen.

By this point, it was a {{cvt|63 by 53.3|ft|m}} long and wide aircraft capable of a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of {{cvt|7,240|km|nmi}}; as an [[executive jet]] it had sufficient capacity for 14 passengers, in a [[cargo aircraft|freighter]] configuration it had a 3,400&nbsp;kg (7,500&nbsp;lbs) payload capacity, loaded and unloaded via a forward door, or as [[commuter airliner]] it could seat up to 30 passengers in a 2\u20131 seating configuration.<ref name=Upton2007/> Canadair developed the design into a large airframe furnished with a new supercritical wing design, new avionics and engines, as well as for compliance with new [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Part 25|FAR part 25]] standards.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> The configuration was frozen in August and a 1/25 model was tested in the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Aeronautical Establishment]] transonic [[wind tunnel]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, in excessof 1,800 hours of wind tunnel testing was performed upon the supercritical wing alone.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Launch===\nBacked by the Federal Government, the programme was launched on 29 October 1976 with firm orders and deposits for 53 aircraft.<ref name=Upton2007/> Within the next two years, roughly 2,500 employees would be involved in designing the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Various changes to the original Learstar configuration had been made on the run up to launch, such as the [[conventional tail|conventional]] tailplane being substituted for a [[T-tail]] counterpart after the former was found to be in the path of the engine's exhaust flow, the relocation of fuel storage to the wings, and multiple increases of the aircraft's gross weight.<ref name=Upton2007/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following disagreements over the direction of the programme, Bill Lear was phased out of involvement; accordingly, in March 1977, the aircraft was renamed the Challenger 600.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, following his disassociation with the venture, Lear referred to Canadair's revised design as ''Fat Albert''.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following Lear's death in May 1978, Canadair paid an estimated $25 million to his estate for his contribution to the programme.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nDue to the expansion of the design, the original powerplant configuration became untenable; thus engine manufacturer [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]] proposed developing a new model, the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L, which Canadair's design team accepted for the enlarged Challenger and drew up its general arrangement around.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The type's wide cargo door had been designed in response to the needs of [[FedEx]], the type's original launch customer, having placed an order for 25 aircraft.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> Additionally, FedEx had experienced problems with the [[General Electric CF34]] engines, and favoured the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]D instead; those later had delivery troubles and lacked performance.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, FedEx converted most of its orders into the Challenger's stretched version, intending to carry up to 12,500&nbsp;lb of freight at a time using them.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> However, FedEx ultimately opted to cancel its orders due to the US [[Airline Deregulation Act]], and the specific aircraft that were already in production were sold to other customers instead.<ref name=Upton2007/>\n\nBy the spring of 1977, Canadair had received over 70 firm orders and had begun constructing three [[prototypes]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Furthermore, a $70 million loan was borrowed from [[Europe]]an sources to help finance the programme, which lessened the financial burden on the Canadian government.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> A full-scale fuselage [[mockup]] was displayed at the 1977 [[Paris Air Show]] before a European and North American tour and 106 had been sold by 1977 end.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> During late 1977, in the face of criticism that the project would not be capable of producing an aircraft fulfilling the performance guarantees made, Canadair officials had commented that they expected the first flight to occur during the following year and that initial deliveries had been scheduled to commence during September 1979. Flight International noted that even prior to the prototype's first flight, the type had already made a noticeable impact upon the competition, including the launch of the [[Cessna Citation III]] and [[Grumman Gulfstream III]].<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nAirframe [[structural]] testing began in February 1979 and operational test cycling started in December 1979, simulating 72,638 [[flight hours]] by February 1985 while predicted lifetime was 30,000 hours.<!--ref name=Upton2007/--> By early March 1978, the first prototype was almost finished and the assembly of the two other had debuted;<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> destined to control [[handling qualities]] and test flight performance, it was formally rolled out on 25 May 1978, while 116 orders had been confirmed 19 months after go-ahead.<ref name=Upton2007/> By this point, production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] allowing for a production rate of up to seven Challengers per month had been established, ready for quantity production to proceed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Flight test phase===\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600, Bombardier AN1006238.jpg|thumb|The third prototype was reused as the {{abbr|ACT|Active Control Technology}} [[fly-by-wire]] demonstrator.<ref name=Upton2007>{{cite web |publisher= Canada aviation museum |title= Canadair CL-600 / 601 / 604 Challenger serial 1003, registration C-GCGT |author= Bill Upton |date= 2007 |url= https://documents.techno-science.ca/documents/CASM-Aircrafthistories-CanadairCL-600Challenger.pdf}}</ref>]]\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype aircraft took off for its [[maiden flight]] from [[Montreal, Quebec]].

The publication also commented that the Challenger family \"appears to have a solid future\", observing a production rate of two aircraft per month throughout 2018.<ref name=Flight25Nov2018/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, Bombardier AN1445479.jpg|thumb|The Challenger cabin]]\nThe Challenger is a twin-engined [[business jet]], described by Flight International as being \u2018\u2019miniturised twinjet airliner in every respect\u2019\u2019.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> While the Challenger is generally similar in configuration to previous aircraft of its type, some of its features stand out; for example, the use of a widened fuselage that allows a \"walk-about cabin\". The Challenger was also one of the first business jets to be designed with a [[Supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]]. The wing was referred by Canadair as being one of the aircraft's most advanced features.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It is also capable of performing short takeoffs while maintaining the speed and comfort levels normally associated with larger jetliners.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Challengers can be identified visually from their peers by their distinctive [[Flap (aeronautics)#Types of flaps|double slotted hinged flap]] arrangement, where the fairings can be seen below the wings, a configuration that was much more common on commercial airliners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Challenger's wing has been referred to as being a modified [[NACA]] symmetrical aerofoil.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Akin to other supercritical wings, it features a rounded [[leading edge]], an inverted [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], a blunt [[trailing edge]] and scalloping of the underside. The twin-spar wing box structure spans the entire length of the wing and is compartmentalised to form five internal fuel tanks; these tanks can accommodate up to 14,661&nbsp;lb of fuel, nearly half the aircraft's empty weight.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The skins of the wings are produced via large milling machines, which in 1978 were claimed to be in excess of anything else in [[North America]]. Many elements, such as the flaps, [[aileron]]s and leading edge feature conventional construction; however, several parts, including the wing/fuselage fairing, flap shrouds and wingtips are [[Molding (process)|mold]]ed out of [[Kevlar]], as are other elements of the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe original CL-600 Challenger was powered by a pair of [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L [[turbojet]] engines, which was developed specifically for the Challenger.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Subsequent models would adopt other powerplants, including the [[General Electric CF34]] engine. The engines are mounted on the rear fuselage close to the aircraft's tail, providing smooth airflow to the engines even when flown at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], although this was in a lower position than the original Learstar concept had placed them to mitigate against unfavourable pitch control characteristics.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The engines are fitted with [[thrust reverser]]s to decrease landing distances. An [[auxiliary power unit]] is also present for starting the engines and providing [[air conditioning]] within the cabin while on the ground.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe fuselage comprises three sections \u2013 the nose, centre, and tail \u2013 which are manufactured separately in their own jigs and joined late on in the production process.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It has been designed to be [[pressurization|pressurised]] at a maximum differential of 9.3&nbsp;lb per square inch. Various cutouts are present across the fuselage to accommodate various features, such as a large main door on the port side of the aircraft forward of the wing, multiple regulation-compliant [[emergency exit]]s, a baggage hatch on the port side aft of the wing, and numerous windows.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The fuselage's diameter was designed to accommodate an unobstructed cabin floor, a cabin height of 6&nbsp;ft 1inch in the centre section, as well as space for the [[wing box]], underfloor integral fuel tanks, air ducts, and various control cabling. It was also designed to easily accommodate Canadair's early plans to stretch the fuselage, for which equal-length plugs are installed fore and after of the centre section to vastly increase the Challenger's capacity.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nVarious avionics are present upon the Challenger.

[[Bombardier Aerospace]].\n<!--Development-->\nAt the end of 1975, Canadair backed the LearStar 600 concept by [[Bill Lear]], and acquired the large business jet or freighter project in April 1976.<!--ref name=Upton2007--><!--ref name=Flight12aug1978-->\nOn 29 October, the programme was launched, backed by the [[Canadian federal government]], and designed to comply with new [[Federal

1980.\n\nIn 1986, Canadair was to close to [[bankruptcy]] and was bought by Bombardier.<!--ref name=Flight25Nov2018-->\nThe jet was stretched into the [[Bombardier CRJ100/200|Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliner, introduced on 19 October 1992, and the longer range [[Global Express]], introduced in July 1999.\nThe 500th Challenger was rolled out in May 2000,<!--ref name=Flight10oct2018/--> and the 1000th was delivered to [[NetJets]] in December 2015.\nBy October 2018, 1,066 aircraft have been built.<!--ref name=Flight12oct2018/-->\n\n<!--design-->\nThe Challenger is a low-wing jet powered by two turbofans mounted in aft fuselage pods, it has a [[supercritical wing]] and a stand-up cabin with two seating sections.\n<!--Variants-->\nThe original [[Lycoming ALF 502]] turbofans were replaced by a pair of [[General Electric CF34]]s on the CL-601, which also gained [[winglets]], and first flew on 10 April 1982.<!--ref name=Flight29May1982-->\nSubsequent variants have updated systems,

However, Lear lacked the capabilities to launch such an aircraft, and thus sought out other agencies to collaborate with to both produce and sell it, including the [[Canada|Canadian]] aerospace manufacturer [[Canadair]]. According to authors Ron Picklet and Larry Milberry, Canadair's top management were of the opinion that Lear's concept was sketchy at best.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\">Pickler, Ron and [[Larry Milberry]]. ''Canadair: The First 50 Years.''

Toronto, Ontario: Macmillan Canada. 1992. {{ISBN|0-77159-145-4}}, p. 55-57.</ref>\n\nFollowing a study, contrasting the proposed Learstar against rivals such as the [[Lockheed Jetstar]], [[Dassault Falcon 50]], and [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], Canadair decided to give its backing to the idea near the end of 1975.<ref name=Upton2007/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> According to aerospace industry publication [[Flight International]], the programme was viewed by many Canadians as a step towards developing a privately driven high-technology aviation industry that would compete at a global level.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Perhaps more importantly, the Canadian government had issued a demand that Canadair become self-sufficient, thus the company wanted to depend less upon [[subcontractor|subcontracting]] arrangements with other firms, such as France's [[Dassault Aviation]] and America's [[Boeing]], or providing support packages for existing aircraft that they had already ended production of, such as the [[Canadair CF-5|CF-5]] fighter. Canadair felt a need to prove its ability to independently develop original high-tech projects at this time.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nCanadair planned to use Lear's name and skills at self-promotion to secure extensive financial guarantees for a business jet project from the Canadian Federal government.<ref name=\"Pickler and Milberry p. 263\"/> This proved an effective choice: future Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] specifically refers to the effect of personal contact with Lear on his decision to direct financial support to Canadair's program.<ref>Low, Stephen.

Due to the use of [[Letter of comfort (contract law)|letters of comfort]], the extent of the Ministry's financial commitments for Canadair could be kept from parliament and the public for several years.<ref>''Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the House of Commons'' for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1982, para. 10.95 to 10.100.</ref> These financial guarantees were later used as an academic example of insufficient monitoring and lax controls in government support of industry.<ref>Borins, Stanford F. and Lee Brown.

By this point, it was a {{cvt|63 by 53.3|ft|m}} long and wide aircraft capable of a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of {{cvt|7,240|km|nmi}}; as an [[executive jet]] it had sufficient capacity for 14 passengers, in a [[cargo aircraft|freighter]] configuration it had a 3,400&nbsp;kg (7,500&nbsp;lbs) payload capacity, loaded and unloaded via a forward door, or as [[commuter airliner]] it could seat up to 30 passengers in a 2\u20131 seating configuration.<ref name=Upton2007/> Canadair developed the design into a large airframe furnished with a new supercritical wing design, new avionics and engines, as well as for compliance with new [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Part 25|FAR part 25]] standards.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> The configuration was frozen in August and a 1/25 model was tested in the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Aeronautical Establishment]] transonic [[wind tunnel]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, in excessof 1,800 hours of wind tunnel testing was performed upon the supercritical wing alone.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Launch===\nBacked by the Federal Government, the programme was launched on 29 October 1976 with firm orders and deposits for 53 aircraft.<ref name=Upton2007/> Within the next two years, roughly 2,500 employees would be involved in designing the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Various changes to the original Learstar configuration had been made on the run up to launch, such as the [[conventional tail|conventional]] tailplane being substituted for a [[T-tail]] counterpart after the former was found to be in the path of the engine's exhaust flow, the relocation of fuel storage to the wings, and multiple increases of the aircraft's gross weight.<ref name=Upton2007/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following disagreements over the direction of the programme, Bill Lear was phased out of involvement; accordingly, in March 1977, the aircraft was renamed the Challenger 600.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, following his disassociation with the venture, Lear referred to Canadair's revised design as ''Fat Albert''.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Following Lear's death in May 1978, Canadair paid an estimated $25 million to his estate for his contribution to the programme.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nDue to the expansion of the design, the original powerplant configuration became untenable; thus engine manufacturer [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]] proposed developing a new model, the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L, which Canadair's design team accepted for the enlarged Challenger and drew up its general arrangement around.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The type's wide cargo door had been designed in response to the needs of [[FedEx]], the type's original launch customer, having placed an order for 25 aircraft.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> Additionally, FedEx had experienced problems with the [[General Electric CF34]] engines, and favoured the [[Lycoming ALF 502]]D instead; those later had delivery troubles and lacked performance.<ref name=Upton2007/> Reportedly, FedEx converted most of its orders into the Challenger's stretched version, intending to carry up to 12,500&nbsp;lb of freight at a time using them.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> However, FedEx ultimately opted to cancel its orders due to the US [[Airline Deregulation Act]], and the specific aircraft that were already in production were sold to other customers instead.<ref name=Upton2007/>\n\nBy the spring of 1977, Canadair had received over 70 firm orders and had begun constructing three [[prototypes]].<ref name=Upton2007/> Furthermore, a $70 million loan was borrowed from [[Europe]]an sources to help finance the programme, which lessened the financial burden on the Canadian government.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> A full-scale fuselage [[mockup]] was displayed at the 1977 [[Paris Air Show]] before a European and North American tour and 106 had been sold by 1977 end.<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> During late 1977, in the face of criticism that the project would not be capable of producing an aircraft fulfilling the performance guarantees made, Canadair officials had commented that they expected the first flight to occur during the following year and that initial deliveries had been scheduled to commence during September 1979. Flight International noted that even prior to the prototype's first flight, the type had already made a noticeable impact upon the competition, including the launch of the [[Cessna Citation III]] and [[Grumman Gulfstream III]].<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nAirframe [[structural]] testing began in February 1979 and operational test cycling started in December 1979, simulating 72,638 [[flight hours]] by February 1985 while predicted lifetime was 30,000 hours.<!--ref name=Upton2007/--> By early March 1978, the first prototype was almost finished and the assembly of the two other had debuted;<!--<ref name=Upton2007/>--> destined to control [[handling qualities]] and test flight performance, it was formally rolled out on 25 May 1978, while 116 orders had been confirmed 19 months after go-ahead.<ref name=Upton2007/> By this point, production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] allowing for a production rate of up to seven Challengers per month had been established, ready for quantity production to proceed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n===Flight test phase===\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600, Bombardier AN1006238.jpg|thumb|The third prototype was reused as the {{abbr|ACT|Active Control Technology}} [[fly-by-wire]] demonstrator.<ref name=Upton2007>{{cite web |publisher= Canada aviation museum |title= Canadair CL-600 / 601 / 604 Challenger serial 1003, registration C-GCGT |author= Bill Upton |date= 2007 |url= https://documents.techno-science.ca/documents/CASM-Aircrafthistories-CanadairCL-600Challenger.pdf}}</ref>]]\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype aircraft took off for its [[maiden flight]] from [[Montreal, Quebec]].

The wing was referred by Canadair as being one of the aircraft's most advanced features.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It is also capable of performing short takeoffs while maintaining the speed and comfort levels normally associated with larger jetliners.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Challengers can be identified visually from their peers by their distinctive [[Flap (aeronautics)#Types of flaps|double slotted hinged flap]] arrangement, where the fairings can be seen below the wings, a configuration that was much more common on commercial airliners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Challenger's wing has been referred to as being a modified [[NACA]] symmetrical aerofoil.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Akin to other supercritical wings, it features a rounded [[leading edge]], an inverted [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], a blunt [[trailing edge]] and scalloping of the underside. The twin-spar wing box structure spans the entire length of the wing and is compartmentalised to form five internal fuel tanks; these tanks can accommodate up to 14,661&nbsp;lb of fuel, nearly half the aircraft's empty weight.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The skins of the wings are produced via large milling machines, which in 1978 were claimed to be in excess of anything else in [[North America]]. Many elements, such as the flaps, [[aileron]]s and leading edge feature conventional construction; however, several parts, including the wing/fuselage fairing, flap shrouds and wingtips are [[mold]]ed out of [[Kevlar]], as are other elements of the aircraft.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe original CL-600 Challenger was powered by a pair of [[Lycoming ALF 502]]L [[turbojet]] engines, which was developed specifically for the Challenger.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> Subsequent models would adopt other powerplants, including the [[General Electric CF34]] engine. The engines are mounted on the rear fuselage close to the aircraft's tail, providing smooth airflow to the engines even when flown at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], although this was in a lower position than the original Learstar concept had placed them to mitigate against unfavourable pitch control characteristics.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The engines are fitted with [[thrust reverser]]s to decrease landing distances. An [[auxiliary power unit]] is also present for starting the engines and providing [[air conditioning]] within the cabin while on the ground.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nThe fuselage comprises three sections \u2013 the nose, centre, and tail \u2013 which are manufactured separately in their own jigs and joined late on in the production process.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> It has been designed to be [[pressurization|pressurised]] at a maximum differential of 9.3&nbsp;lb per square inch. Various cutouts are present across the fuselage to accommodate various features, such as a large main door on the port side of the aircraft forward of the wing, multiple regulation-compliant [[emergency exit]]s, a baggage hatch on the port side aft of the wing, and numerous windows.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The fuselage's diameter was designed to accommodate an unobstructed cabin floor, a cabin height of 6&nbsp;ft 1inch in the centre section, as well as space for the [[wing box]], underfloor integral fuel tanks, air ducts, and various control cabling. It was also designed to easily accommodate Canadair's early plans to stretch the fuselage, for which equal-length plugs are installed fore and after of the centre section to vastly increase the Challenger's capacity.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nVarious avionics are present upon the Challenger. As standard, the CL-600 is furnished with a dual-channel [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] SPZ-600 [[flight control system|automatic flight control system]], incorporating a [[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] and [[air data computer]]s; more typical to larger commercial aircraft, this system is certifiable for conducting category 3A automatic landings.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The flight control system features significant redundancy, including three individual [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems; even with complete failure and the loss of one [[actuator]], a viable level of assisted control over the key flight surfaces remains present. [[Weather radar]] and [[Marconi]]-built solid-state instrument displays are supplied as standard, as well as a [[Rockwell Collins|Collins]]-built radio set; optional long range radio-based equipment, such as a [[High frequency|HF]] radio set and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] navigational aids can be installed.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\nIn a standard executive aircraft configuration, the cabin is divided between the forward galley, and two seating sections, which are typically fitted with a four-chair club section followed by either a conference grouping area or divans, along with a lavatory at the aft end.<ref name=BCA25aug2016/><ref name=Flight12aug1978/> The chairs are fully reclining and can swivel, while the divans can serve as sleeping accommodation. Early examples feature luxuries such as telephones, lighting controls, and stereo systems; foldaway tables attached to the cabin walls were also installed, along with a pair of wardrobes, one fore and one aft, for storing hand luggage and other small items.<ref name=Flight12aug1978/>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-1A11 Challenger 600 AN1902275.jpg|thumb|Original CL-600s have ALF 502s with full cowlings and do not have winglets, and their tail cones are truncated.]]\n[[File:Untitled Canadair 605 Challenger; VP-BKA@ZRH;10.03.2012 (6976549005).jpg|thumb|Later Challengers have winglets and are powered by CF34s with exposed nozzles, and from the pictured CL-605 have streamlined tail cones.]]\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2A12 Challenger 601 AN2214078.jpg|thumb|The early 601 has small [[Primary flight display|PFDs]].]]\n[[File:VH-URR Bombardier CL-600-2B16 Challenger 604 (6485923771).jpg|thumb|The later 604 has larger screens.]]\n[[File:Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, Bombardier AN1426362.jpg|thumb|The 605 modern flight deck]]\n\n===CL-600 (1A11)===\n;CL-600: Original production version, powered by [[Lycoming ALF 502]] turbofans of 7500&nbsp;lbf (33.6&nbsp;kN) thrust each.

The airplane at 41,000 pounds (17,500&nbsp;kg) gross weight was loaded too far forward, and the pilots were unable to raise the nose during the takeoff run. The airplane rolled off the runway, across a highway (striking one vehicle), and came to rest partially inside a building. There were 4 serious injuries and 10 lesser injuries.<ref>[https://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/when-pilots-become-passengers?NL=AW-05&Issue=AW-05_20190322_AW-05_309&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_4&elq2=cd95c5fe6c6a44179aaec76598d5a7da Albright, James. \"When Pilots Become Passengers\".

The aircraft attempted a tailwind landing in low-level windshear and gust conditions, then declared a missed approach and executed a go-around. Upon the second landing attempt, the aircraft touched down, bounced airborne again and slammed into the runway, coming to rest upside-down near the departure end, in flames and its right wing separated from the airframe. One crewmember was killed; another crewmember and a passenger sustained serious injuries.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20140106X95024 \"NTSB Aircraft Accident Brief.\"] Retrieved: June 12, 2016.</ref>\n* On January 7, 2017, a Bombardier Challenger CL-604 lost altitude of nearly 9,000 feet as a result of severe wake turbulence from an [[Airbus A380]].

The [[history of Chinese currency]] dates back as early as the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770\u2013476 BCE), and the earliest coinages took the form of imitations of the [[cowrie shells]] that were used in ceremonial exchanges. During the [[Warring States period]] new forms of currency such as the [[spade money]], [[knife money]], and [[Huanqian|round copper-alloy coins]] were introduced (further reading: [[Zhou dynasty coinage]] and [[Ancient Chinese coinage]]). After unification of China under the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC the [[Ban Liang]] (\u534a\u5169) [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash coin]] became the standard coinage, under the [[Han dynasty]] the [[Wu Zhu]] (\u4e94\u9296) cash coins became the main currency of China until they were replaced with the [[Kaiyuan Tongbao]] (\u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf3) during the [[Tang dynasty]], after which [[List of Chinese cash coins by inscription|a large number of inscriptions]] were used on Chinese coinages. During the late nineteenth century China started producing its own [[Milled coinage|machine-struck coinages]]. \n\nIn [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] coins are often used as burial objects and it's not uncommon for coins to be discovered in tombs and graves. \n\nOccasionally foreign coins are also found in China, which were brought there through [[international trade]] routes such as the [[silk road]], overseas trade with foreign countries, and [[colonialism]].

{"title_page": "Mixing (process engineering)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{continuum mechanics|cTopic=fluid}}\nIn industrial [[process engineering]], '''mixing''' is a [[unit operation]] that involves manipulation of a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] physical system with the intent to make it more [[homogeneous mixture|homogeneous]]. Familiar examples include [[pump]]ing of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of [[pancake]] batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing.<ref name=ullmann>Ullmann, Fritz (2005). Ullmann's Chemical Engineering and Plant Design, Volumes 1\u20132. John Wiley & Sons. http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpUCEPDV02/ullmanns-chemical-engineering</ref> Some classes of [[chemical reactor]]s are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A [[biofuel]] fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic [[nitration]] requires concentrated (liquid) [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[sulfuric acid]]s to be mixed with a [[hydrophobic]] organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is [[Separation process|segregation]]. A classical example of segregation is the [[brazil nut effect]].\n[[File:Agitated vessel.svg|thumb|300px|right|Schematics of an agitated vessel with a Rushton turbine and baffles]]\n\n==Mixing classification==\nThe type of operation and equipment used during mixing depends on the state of materials being mixed (liquid, semi-solid, or solid) and the miscibility of the materials being processed. In this context, the act of mixing may be synonymous with stirring-, or kneading-processes.<ref name=\"ullmann\" />\n\n== Liquid\u2013liquid mixing ==\nMixing of liquids occurs frequently in process engineering. The nature of liquids to blend determines the equipment used. Single-phase blending tends to involve low-shear, high-flow mixers to cause liquid engulfment, while multi-phase mixing generally requires the use of high-shear, low-flow mixers to create droplets of one liquid in [[laminar flow|laminar]], [[turbulent]] or transitional flow regimes, depending on the [[Reynolds number]] of the flow. Turbulent or transitional mixing is frequently conducted with [[turbine]]s or [[impeller]]s; laminar mixing is conducted with helical ribbon or anchor mixers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc13.htm |title=Various Mixing Experiments |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145907/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc13.htm |archivedate=26 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Single-phase blending===\nMixing of liquids that are [[miscible]] or at least [[soluble]] in each other occurs frequently in process engineering (and in everyday life). An everyday example would be the addition of milk or cream to tea or coffee. Since both liquids are water-based, they dissolve easily in one another. The momentum of the liquid being added is sometimes enough to cause enough [[turbulence]] to mix the two, since the [[viscosity]] of both liquids is relatively low. If necessary, a spoon or paddle could be used to complete the mixing process. Blending in a more viscous liquid, such as [[honey]], requires more mixing [[power (physics)|power]] per unit volume to achieve the same homogeneity in the same amount of time.\n\n==Gas\u2013gas mixing==\n{{main article|Gas blending}}\n\n==Solid\u2013solid mixing==\nBlending powders is one of the oldest unit-operations in the solids handling industries. For many decades powder blending has been used just to homogenize bulk materials. Many different machines have been designed to handle materials with various bulk solids properties. On the basis of the practical experience gained with these different machines, engineering knowledge has been developed to construct reliable equipment and to predict scale-up and mixing behavior. Nowadays the same mixing technologies are used for many more applications: to improve product quality, to coat particles, to fuse materials, to wet, to disperse in liquid, to agglomerate, to alter functional material properties, etc.\nThis wide range of  applications of mixing equipment requires a high level of knowledge, long time experience  and extended test facilities to come to the optimal selection of equipment and processes.\n\n[[File:Machine for incorporating liquids and finely-ground solids.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Machine for incorporating liquids and finely ground solids]]\n\nSolid-solid mixing can be performed either in batch mixers, which is the simpler form of mixing, or in certain cases in continuous dry-mix, more complex but which provide interesting advantages in terms of segregation, capacity and validation<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://powderprocess.net/Mixing/Comparison_Continuous_Batch_Mixing.html | title=Batch and continuous solids mixing comparison - Powder Mixing}}</ref>.\nOne example of a solid\u2013solid mixing process is mulling foundry [[molding (process)|molding]] sand, where sand, [[bentonite]] [[clay]], fine coal dust and water are mixed to a [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]], [[Molding (process)|mold]]able and reusable mass, applied for molding and pouring [[molten]] metal to obtain [[sand casting]]s that are metallic parts for automobile, machine building, construction or other industries.\n\n===Mixing mechanisms===\nIn powder two different dimensions in the mixing process can be determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Mixing.html|title=Powder Mixing - Design - problem solving - Ribbon blender, Paddle mixer, Drum blender, Froude Number - PowderProcess.net|website=www.powderprocess.net|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928143738/http://www.powderprocess.net/Mixing.html|archivedate=28 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials. \n\nPossible threats during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation.\n \nWhen materials are cohesive, which is the case with e.g. fine particles and also with wet material, convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the lump size additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.\n\n==Liquid\u2013solid mixing==\nLiquid\u2013solid mixing is typically done to suspend coarse free-flowing solids, or to break up lumps of fine agglomerated solids. An example of the former is the mixing granulated sugar into water; an example of the latter is the mixing of flour or powdered milk into water. In the first case, the particles can be lifted into suspension (and separated from one another) by bulk motion of the fluid; in the second, the mixer itself (or the high shear field near it) must destabilize the lumps and cause them to disintegrate.\n\nOne example of a solid\u2013liquid mixing process in industry is concrete mixing, where cement, sand, small stones or gravel and water are commingled to a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] self-hardening [[mass]], used in the construction industry.\n\n===Solid suspension===\nSuspension of solids into a liquid is done to improve the rate of mass transfer between the solid and the liquid. Examples include dissolving a solid reactant into a solvent, or suspending catalyst particles in liquid to improve the flow of reactants and products to and from the particles. The associated [[eddy diffusion]] increases the rate of mass transfer within the bulk of the fluid, and the convection of material away from the particles decreases the size of the [[boundary layer]], where most of the resistance to mass transfer occurs. Axial-flow impellers are preferred for solid suspension, although radial-flow impellers can be used in a tank with baffles, which converts some of the rotational motion into vertical motion. When the solid is denser than the liquid (and therefore collects at the bottom of the tank), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed downwards; when the solid is less dense than the liquid (and therefore floats on top), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed upwards (though this is relatively rare). The equipment preferred for solid suspension produces large volumetric flows but not necessarily high shear; high flow-number turbine impellers, such as hydrofoils, are typically used. Multiple turbines mounted on the same shaft can reduce power draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc4.htm |title=Stirred Vessels |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814175734/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc4.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Solid deagglomeration===\nVery fine powders, such as [[titanium dioxide]] pigments, and materials that have been [[spray drying|spray dried]] may [[agglomerate]] or form lumps during transportation and storage. Starchy materials or those that form gels when exposed to solvent can form lumps that are [[wetting|wetted]] on the outside but dry on the inside. These types of materials are not easily mixed into liquid with the types of mixers preferred for solid suspension because the agglomerate particles must be subjected to intense shear to be broken up. In some ways, deagglomeration of solids is similar to the blending of immiscible liquids, except for the fact that [[coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]] is usually not a problem. An everyday example of this type of mixing is the production of [[milkshake]]s from liquid milk and solid ice cream. \n\n==Liquid\u2013gas mixing==\nLiquids and gases are typically mixed to allow [[mass transfer]] to occur. For instance, in the case of [[air stripping]], gas is used to remove volatiles from a liquid. Typically, a [[packed column]] is used for this purpose, with the packing acting as a motionless mixer and the air pump providing the driving force. When a tank and impeller are used, the objective is typically to ensure that the gas bubbles remain in contact with the liquid for as long as possible. This is especially important if the gas is expensive, such as pure [[oxygen]], or diffuses slowly into the liquid. Mixing in a tank is also useful when a (relatively) slow chemical reaction is occurring in the liquid phase, and so the concentration difference in the thin layer near the bubble is close to that of the bulk. This reduces the driving force for mass transfer. If there is a (relatively) fast chemical reaction in the liquid phase, it is sometimes advantageous to disperse but not recirculate the gas bubbles, ensuring that they are in [[plug flow]] and can transfer mass more efficiently.\n\n[[Rushton turbine]]s have been traditionally used to disperse gases into liquids, but newer options, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine are becoming more prevalent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-principles/ |title=Turbine principles |publisher=Cercell.com |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611222544/http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-principles |archivedate=11 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  One of the issues is that as the gas flow increases, more and more of the gas accumulates in the low pressure zones behind the impeller blades, which reduces the power drawn by the mixer (and therefore its effectiveness). Newer designs, such as the GDX impeller, have nearly eliminated this problem.\n\n==Gas\u2013solid mixing==\n{{main article|Fluidization}}\n\nGas\u2013solid mixing may be conducted to transport powders or small particulate solids from one place to another, or to mix gaseous reactants with solid catalyst particles. In either case, the turbulent eddies of the gas must provide enough force to suspend the solid particles, which otherwise sink under the force of [[gravity]]. The size and shape of the particles is an important consideration, since different particles have different [[drag coefficient]]s, and particles made of different materials have different [[Density|densities]].\nA common unit operation the process industry uses to separate gases and solids is the [[cyclonic separation|cyclone]], which slows the gas and causes the particles to settle out.\n\n==Multiphase mixing==\nMultiphase mixing occurs when solids, liquids and gases are combined in one step. This may occur as part of a catalytic chemical process, in which liquid and gaseous reagents must be combined with a solid catalyst (such as [[hydrogenation]]); or in fermentation, where solid microbes and the gases they require must be well-distributed in a liquid medium. The type of mixer used depends upon the properties of the phases. In some cases, the mixing power is provided by the gas itself as it moves up through the liquid, [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entraining]] liquid with the bubble plume. This draws liquid upwards inside the plume, and causes liquid to fall outside the plume. If the viscosity of the liquid is too high to allow for this (or if the solid particles are too heavy), an impeller may be needed to keep the solid particles suspended.\n\n[[File:Fluidized Bed Reactor Graphic.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic drawing of a fluidized bed reactor]]\n\n== Basic Nomenclature ==\nFor liquid mixing, the nomenclature is rather standardized:\n\n* Impeller Diameter, \"D\" is measured for industrial mixers as the maximum diameter swept around the axis of rotation.\n* Rotational Speed, \"N\" is usually measured in revolutions per minute(RPM) or revolutions per second(RPS).  This variable refers to the rotational speed of the impeller as this number can differ along points of the drive train.\n* Tank Diameter, \"T\" The inside diameter of a cylindrical vessel.  Most mixing vessels receiving industrial mixers will be cylindrical.\n* Power, \"P\" Is the energy input into a system usually by an [[electric motor]] or a [[pneumatic motor]]\n* Impeller Pumping Capacity, \"Q\"  The resulting fluid motion from impeller rotation.\n\n==Constitutive equations==\nMany of the equations used for determining the output of mixers are empirically derived, or contain empirically-derived constants. Since mixers operate in the turbulent regime, many of the equations are approximations that are considered acceptable for most engineering purposes.\n\nWhen a mixing impeller rotates in the fluid, it generates a combination of flow and shear.  The impeller generated flow can be calculated with the following equation:\n\n<math> Q = Fl*N*D^3 </math>\n\nFlow numbers for impellers have been published in the North American Mixing Forum sponsored Handbook of Industrial Mixing.<ref name=Handbook>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Industrial Mixing: Science and Practice |editor1=Edward L.

Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. Magnetic stir bars are radial-flow mixers that induce [[rigid body|solid body rotation]] in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of stir bar configurations exist, but because of the small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical stir bar can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in [[iodometry]], deagglomeration (useful for preparation of microbiology [[growth medium]] from powders), and liquid\u2013liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests on the bottom of the vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, [[Erlenmeyer flask]]s, or [[Florence flask]]s may be used in addition to the more cylindrical [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]].\n\n== Mixing in microfluidics ==\nWhen scaled down to the microscale, fluid mixing behaves radically different.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Nam-Trung|author2=Wu, Zhigang|title=Micromixers\u2014a review|journal=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering|date=1 February 2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=R1\u2013R16|doi=10.1088/0960-1317/15/2/R01|bibcode = 2005JMiMi..15R...1N |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/47df8e4ff4ea24d987154cd0224eb43d6dd15a24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://redbudlabs.com/microfluidic-mixing/|title=Microfluidic Mixing - Redbud Labs|website=redbudlabs.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102092036/https://redbudlabs.com/microfluidic-mixing/|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is typically at sizes from a couple (2 or 3) millimeters down to the nanometer range.  At this size range normal convection does not happen unless you force it.  Diffusion is the dominate mechanism whereby two different fluids come together.  Diffusion is a relatively slow process.  Hence a number of researchers had to devise ways to get the two fluids to mix.  This involved Y junctions, T junctions, three-way intersections and designs where the interfacial area between the two fluids is maximized.  Beyond just interfacing the two liquids people also made twisting channels to force the two fluids to mix.  These included multilayered devices where the fluids would corkscrew, looped devices where the fluids would flow around obstructions and wavy devices where the channel would constrict and flare out.  Additionally channels with features on the walls like notches or groves were tried.\n\nOne way to tell if mixing is happening due to convection or diffusion is by finding the Peclet number. It is the ratio of convection to diffusion.  At high Peclet numbers, convection dominates.  At low Peclet numbers, diffusion dominates.\n\nPeclet = flow velocity * mixing path / diffusion coefficient\n\n==Industrial mixing equipment==\nAt an industrial scale, efficient mixing can be difficult to achieve. A great deal of engineering effort goes into designing and improving mixing processes. Mixing at industrial scale is done in batches (dynamic mixing), inline or with help of [[static mixer]]s. Moving mixers are powered with [[electric motor]]s that operate at standard speeds of 1800 or 1500 RPM, which is typically much faster than necessary. [[Gearbox]]es are used to reduce speed and increase torque.  Some applications require the use of multi-shaft mixers, in which a combination of mixer types are used to completely blend the product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockmeyer.com/products/high-viscosity-mixers/dual-triple-shaft-mixer-detail.html |title=High Viscosity Mixers: Dual and Triple Shaft Mixers |publisher=Hockmeyer.com |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703141729/http://www.hockmeyer.com/products/high-viscosity-mixers/dual-triple-shaft-mixer-detail.html |archivedate=3 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to performing typical batch mixing operations, some mixing can be done continuously.  Using a machine like the Continuous Processor, one or more dry ingredients and one or more liquid ingredients can be accurately and consistently metered into the machine and see a continuous, homogeneous mixture come out the discharge of the machine.<ref>\"Continuous Processor\" http://www.dairynetwork.com/product.mvc/Continuous-Processor-0002</ref>  Many industries have converted to continuous mixing for many reasons.  Some of those are ease of cleaning, lower energy consumption, smaller footprint, versatility, control, and many others.  Continuous mixers, such as the twin-screw Continuous Processor, also have the ability to handle very high viscosities.\n\n===Turbines===\nA selection of turbine geometries and power numbers are shown below.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em\"\n|+ Selected Turbine Geometries and Power Numbers <br />\n!Name\n!Power number\n!Flow direction\n!Blade angle (degrees)\n!Number of blades\n!Blade geometry\n|-\n| [[Rushton turbine]] || 4.6 || Radial || 0 || 6 || Flat\n|-\n| Pitched blade turbine || 1.3 || Axial || 45\u201360 || 3\u20136 || Flat\n|-\n| Hydrofoil || 0.3 || Axial || 45\u201360 || 3\u20136 || Curved\n|-\n| Marine Propeller || 0.2 || Axial || N/A || 3 || Curved\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n|colspan=6 |\n|}\n\n[[File:Mixing - flusso assiale e radiale.jpg|thumb|200px|Axial flow impeller (left) and radial flow impeller (right).]]\n\nDifferent types of impellers are used for different tasks; for instance, [[Rushton turbine]]s are useful for dispersing gases into liquids, but are not very helpful for dispersing settled solids into liquid. Newer turbines have largely supplanted the Rushton turbine for gas\u2013liquid mixing, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/bt6.htm |title=Asymmetric Blade Impeller |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-12-16 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814175906/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/bt6.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \nThe power number is an empirical measure of the amount of torque needed to drive different impellers in the same fluid at constant power per unit volume; impellers with higher power numbers require more torque but operate at lower speed than impellers with lower power numbers, which operate at lower torque but higher speeds.\n\n===Close-clearance mixers===\nThere are two main types of close-clearance mixers: anchors and helical ribbons. Anchor mixers induce solid-body rotation and do not promote vertical mixing, but helical ribbons do. Close clearance mixers are used in the laminar regime, because the viscosity of the fluid overwhelms the inertial forces of the flow and prevents the fluid leaving the impeller from entraining the fluid next to it. Helical ribbon mixers are typically rotated to push material at the wall downwards, which helps circulate the fluid and refresh the surface at the wall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc10.htm |title=Helical Ribbon Impeller |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814180054/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc10.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>.\n\n===High shear dispersers===\n{{main article|high-shear mixer}}\nHigh shear dispersers create intense shear near the impeller but relatively little flow in the bulk of the vessel. Such devices typically resemble [[circular saw]] blades and are rotated at high speed. Because of their shape, they have a relatively low [[drag coefficient]] and therefore require comparatively little torque to spin at high speed. High shear dispersers are used for forming emulsions (or suspensions) of immiscible liquids and solid deagglomeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockmeyer.com/technical/publications/73-dispersion-tips-help.html |title=A Practical Guide to High Speed Dispersion |publisher=Hockmeyer.com |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610072344/http://www.hockmeyer.com/technical/publications/73-dispersion-tips-help.html |archivedate=10 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Static mixers===\n{{main article| static mixer}}\nStatic mixers are used when a mixing tank would be too large, too slow, or too expensive to use in a given process.\n\n===Liquid whistles===\n{{main article|Liquid Whistle}}\nLiquid whistles are a kind of [[static mixer]] which pass fluid at high pressure through an orifice and subsequently over a blade.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=David|last2=Simmons|first2=Mark|last3=Baker|first3=Michael|date=2017|title=Determination of the flow field inside a Sonolator liquid whistle using PIV and CFD|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|volume=163|pages=123\u2013136|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2017.01.035|doi-access=free}}</ref> This subjects the fluid to high [[Turbulence|turbulent]] stresses and may result in [[Mixing (physics)|mixing]], [[emulsification]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=David|last2=Baker|first2=Michael|last3=Kowalski|first3=Adam|last4=Simmons|first4=Mark|date=2018|title=Emulsification using a \"Sonolator\" liquid whistle: A new correlation for droplet size from pilot-scale experiments|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|volume=189|pages=369\u2013379|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2018.06.004|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/50011638/Ryan_Emulsification_Chemical_Engineering_Science.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis|type=EngD.|last=Ryan|first=David|date=2015|title=Investigation of Fluid Dynamics and Emulsification in Sonolator Liquid Whistles|publisher=University of Birmingham, UK|url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5696/|accessdate=1 Sep 2015}}</ref> deagglomeration and disinfection.\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Paddle-mixer.jpg|thumb|Industrial Paddle Mixer]]\n[[Image:Paddle-Mixers-Logo.gif|thumb|200px|Industrial Paddle Mixer.]]\n[[Image:V-Blender-Logo.gif|thumb|200px|Industrial V Blender.]]\n[[Image:Ribbon-Blender-Logo.gif|thumb|200px|Industrial Ribbon Blender.]]\n[[Image:Double-Cone-Blender-Logo.png|thumb|200px|Industrial Double Cone Blender.]]\n[[Image:High-Shear-Mixers-Granulators-Logo.gif|thumb|200px|Industrial High shear Mixer/Granulator.]]\n[[Image:Drum-Blender-Logo.png|thumb|200px|Drum-Blender]]\n[[File:Double shaft mixer.jpg|thumb|Double shaft mixer for high-viscosity materials]]\n*Ribbon Blender\n*:Ribbon blenders are very common in process industries for performing dry-mixing operations.

Familiar examples include [[pump]]ing of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of [[pancake]] batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing.<ref name=ullmann>Ullmann, Fritz (2005). Ullmann's Chemical Engineering and Plant Design, Volumes 1\u20132. John Wiley & Sons. http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpUCEPDV02/ullmanns-chemical-engineering</ref> Some classes of [[chemical reactor]]s are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A [[biofuel]] fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic [[nitration]] requires concentrated (liquid) [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[sulfuric acid]]s to be mixed with a [[hydrophobic]] organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is [[Separation process|segregation]]. A classical example of segregation is the [[brazil nut effect]].\n[[File:Agitated vessel.svg|thumb|300px|right|Schematics of an agitated vessel with a Rushton turbine and baffles]]\n\n==Mixing classification==\nThe type of operation and equipment used during mixing depends on the state of materials being mixed (liquid, semi-solid, or solid) and the miscibility of the materials being processed. In this context, the act of mixing may be synonymous with stirring-, or kneading-processes.<ref name=\"ullmann\" />\n\n== Liquid\u2013liquid mixing ==\nMixing of liquids occurs frequently in process engineering. The nature of liquids to blend determines the equipment used. Single-phase blending tends to involve low-shear, high-flow mixers to cause liquid engulfment, while multi-phase mixing generally requires the use of high-shear, low-flow mixers to create droplets of one liquid in [[laminar flow|laminar]], [[turbulent]] or transitional flow regimes, depending on the [[Reynolds number]] of the flow. Turbulent or transitional mixing is frequently conducted with [[turbine]]s or [[impeller]]s; laminar mixing is conducted with helical ribbon or anchor mixers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc13.htm |title=Various Mixing Experiments |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145907/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc13.htm |archivedate=26 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Single-phase blending===\nMixing of liquids that are [[miscible]] or at least [[soluble]] in each other occurs frequently in process engineering (and in everyday life). An everyday example would be the addition of milk or cream to tea or coffee. Since both liquids are water-based, they dissolve easily in one another. The momentum of the liquid being added is sometimes enough to cause enough [[turbulence]] to mix the two, since the [[viscosity]] of both liquids is relatively low. If necessary, a spoon or paddle could be used to complete the mixing process. Blending in a more viscous liquid, such as [[honey]], requires more mixing [[power (physics)|power]] per unit volume to achieve the same homogeneity in the same amount of time.\n\n==Gas\u2013gas mixing==\n{{main article|Gas blending}}\n\n==Solid\u2013solid mixing==\nBlending powders is one of the oldest unit-operations in the solids handling industries. For many decades powder blending has been used just to homogenize bulk materials. Many different machines have been designed to handle materials with various bulk solids properties. On the basis of the practical experience gained with these different machines, engineering knowledge has been developed to construct reliable equipment and to predict scale-up and mixing behavior. Nowadays the same mixing technologies are used for many more applications: to improve product quality, to coat particles, to fuse materials, to wet, to disperse in liquid, to agglomerate, to alter functional material properties, etc.\nThis wide range of  applications of mixing equipment requires a high level of knowledge, long time experience  and extended test facilities to come to the optimal selection of equipment and processes.\n\n[[File:Machine for incorporating liquids and finely-ground solids.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Machine for incorporating liquids and finely ground solids]]\n\nSolid-solid mixing can be performed either in batch mixers, which is the simpler form of mixing, or in certain cases in continuous dry-mix, more complex but which provide interesting advantages in terms of segregation, capacity and validation<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://powderprocess.net/Mixing/Comparison_Continuous_Batch_Mixing.html | title=Batch and continuous solids mixing comparison - Powder Mixing}}</ref>.\nOne example of a solid\u2013solid mixing process is mulling foundry [[molding (process)|molding]] sand, where sand, [[bentonite]] [[clay]], fine coal dust and water are mixed to a [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]], [[mold]]able and reusable mass, applied for molding and pouring [[molten]] metal to obtain [[sand casting]]s that are metallic parts for automobile, machine building, construction or other industries.\n\n===Mixing mechanisms===\nIn powder two different dimensions in the mixing process can be determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Mixing.html|title=Powder Mixing - Design - problem solving - Ribbon blender, Paddle mixer, Drum blender, Froude Number - PowderProcess.net|website=www.powderprocess.net|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928143738/http://www.powderprocess.net/Mixing.html|archivedate=28 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials. \n\nPossible threats during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation.\n \nWhen materials are cohesive, which is the case with e.g. fine particles and also with wet material, convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the lump size additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.\n\n==Liquid\u2013solid mixing==\nLiquid\u2013solid mixing is typically done to suspend coarse free-flowing solids, or to break up lumps of fine agglomerated solids. An example of the former is the mixing granulated sugar into water; an example of the latter is the mixing of flour or powdered milk into water. In the first case, the particles can be lifted into suspension (and separated from one another) by bulk motion of the fluid; in the second, the mixer itself (or the high shear field near it) must destabilize the lumps and cause them to disintegrate.\n\nOne example of a solid\u2013liquid mixing process in industry is concrete mixing, where cement, sand, small stones or gravel and water are commingled to a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] self-hardening [[mass]], used in the construction industry.\n\n===Solid suspension===\nSuspension of solids into a liquid is done to improve the rate of mass transfer between the solid and the liquid. Examples include dissolving a solid reactant into a solvent, or suspending catalyst particles in liquid to improve the flow of reactants and products to and from the particles. The associated [[eddy diffusion]] increases the rate of mass transfer within the bulk of the fluid, and the convection of material away from the particles decreases the size of the [[boundary layer]], where most of the resistance to mass transfer occurs. Axial-flow impellers are preferred for solid suspension, although radial-flow impellers can be used in a tank with baffles, which converts some of the rotational motion into vertical motion. When the solid is denser than the liquid (and therefore collects at the bottom of the tank), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed downwards; when the solid is less dense than the liquid (and therefore floats on top), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed upwards (though this is relatively rare). The equipment preferred for solid suspension produces large volumetric flows but not necessarily high shear; high flow-number turbine impellers, such as hydrofoils, are typically used. Multiple turbines mounted on the same shaft can reduce power draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc4.htm |title=Stirred Vessels |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814175734/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc4.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Solid deagglomeration===\nVery fine powders, such as [[titanium dioxide]] pigments, and materials that have been [[spray drying|spray dried]] may [[agglomerate]] or form lumps during transportation and storage. Starchy materials or those that form gels when exposed to solvent can form lumps that are [[wetting|wetted]] on the outside but dry on the inside. These types of materials are not easily mixed into liquid with the types of mixers preferred for solid suspension because the agglomerate particles must be subjected to intense shear to be broken up. In some ways, deagglomeration of solids is similar to the blending of immiscible liquids, except for the fact that [[coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]] is usually not a problem. An everyday example of this type of mixing is the production of [[milkshake]]s from liquid milk and solid ice cream. \n\n==Liquid\u2013gas mixing==\nLiquids and gases are typically mixed to allow [[mass transfer]] to occur. For instance, in the case of [[air stripping]], gas is used to remove volatiles from a liquid. Typically, a [[packed column]] is used for this purpose, with the packing acting as a motionless mixer and the air pump providing the driving force. When a tank and impeller are used, the objective is typically to ensure that the gas bubbles remain in contact with the liquid for as long as possible. This is especially important if the gas is expensive, such as pure [[oxygen]], or diffuses slowly into the liquid. Mixing in a tank is also useful when a (relatively) slow chemical reaction is occurring in the liquid phase, and so the concentration difference in the thin layer near the bubble is close to that of the bulk. This reduces the driving force for mass transfer. If there is a (relatively) fast chemical reaction in the liquid phase, it is sometimes advantageous to disperse but not recirculate the gas bubbles, ensuring that they are in [[plug flow]] and can transfer mass more efficiently.\n\n[[Rushton turbine]]s have been traditionally used to disperse gases into liquids, but newer options, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine are becoming more prevalent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-principles/ |title=Turbine principles |publisher=Cercell.com |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611222544/http://cercell.com/support/bactovessel-details/turbine-principles |archivedate=11 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  One of the issues is that as the gas flow increases, more and more of the gas accumulates in the low pressure zones behind the impeller blades, which reduces the power drawn by the mixer (and therefore its effectiveness). Newer designs, such as the GDX impeller, have nearly eliminated this problem.\n\n==Gas\u2013solid mixing==\n{{main article|Fluidization}}\n\nGas\u2013solid mixing may be conducted to transport powders or small particulate solids from one place to another, or to mix gaseous reactants with solid catalyst particles. In either case, the turbulent eddies of the gas must provide enough force to suspend the solid particles, which otherwise sink under the force of [[gravity]]. The size and shape of the particles is an important consideration, since different particles have different [[drag coefficient]]s, and particles made of different materials have different [[Density|densities]].\nA common unit operation the process industry uses to separate gases and solids is the [[cyclonic separation|cyclone]], which slows the gas and causes the particles to settle out.\n\n==Multiphase mixing==\nMultiphase mixing occurs when solids, liquids and gases are combined in one step. This may occur as part of a catalytic chemical process, in which liquid and gaseous reagents must be combined with a solid catalyst (such as [[hydrogenation]]); or in fermentation, where solid microbes and the gases they require must be well-distributed in a liquid medium. The type of mixer used depends upon the properties of the phases. In some cases, the mixing power is provided by the gas itself as it moves up through the liquid, [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entraining]] liquid with the bubble plume. This draws liquid upwards inside the plume, and causes liquid to fall outside the plume. If the viscosity of the liquid is too high to allow for this (or if the solid particles are too heavy), an impeller may be needed to keep the solid particles suspended.\n\n[[File:Fluidized Bed Reactor Graphic.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic drawing of a fluidized bed reactor]]\n\n== Basic Nomenclature ==\nFor liquid mixing, the nomenclature is rather standardized:\n\n* Impeller Diameter, \"D\" is measured for industrial mixers as the maximum diameter swept around the axis of rotation.\n* Rotational Speed, \"N\" is usually measured in revolutions per minute(RPM) or revolutions per second(RPS).  This variable refers to the rotational speed of the impeller as this number can differ along points of the drive train.\n* Tank Diameter, \"T\" The inside diameter of a cylindrical vessel.  Most mixing vessels receiving industrial mixers will be cylindrical.\n* Power, \"P\" Is the energy input into a system usually by an [[electric motor]] or a [[pneumatic motor]]\n* Impeller Pumping Capacity, \"Q\"  The resulting fluid motion from impeller rotation.\n\n==Constitutive equations==\nMany of the equations used for determining the output of mixers are empirically derived, or contain empirically-derived constants. Since mixers operate in the turbulent regime, many of the equations are approximations that are considered acceptable for most engineering purposes.\n\nWhen a mixing impeller rotates in the fluid, it generates a combination of flow and shear.  The impeller generated flow can be calculated with the following equation:\n\n<math> Q = Fl*N*D^3 </math>\n\nFlow numbers for impellers have been published in the North American Mixing Forum sponsored Handbook of Industrial Mixing.<ref name=Handbook>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Industrial Mixing: Science and Practice |editor1=Edward L.

Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. Magnetic stir bars are radial-flow mixers that induce [[rigid body|solid body rotation]] in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of stir bar configurations exist, but because of the small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical stir bar can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in [[iodometry]], deagglomeration (useful for preparation of microbiology [[growth medium]] from powders), and liquid\u2013liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests on the bottom of the vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, [[Erlenmeyer flask]]s, or [[Florence flask]]s may be used in addition to the more cylindrical [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]].\n\n== Mixing in microfluidics ==\nWhen scaled down to the microscale, fluid mixing behaves radically different.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Nam-Trung|author2=Wu, Zhigang|title=Micromixers\u2014a review|journal=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering|date=1 February 2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=R1\u2013R16|doi=10.1088/0960-1317/15/2/R01|bibcode = 2005JMiMi..15R...1N |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/47df8e4ff4ea24d987154cd0224eb43d6dd15a24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://redbudlabs.com/microfluidic-mixing/|title=Microfluidic Mixing - Redbud Labs|website=redbudlabs.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102092036/https://redbudlabs.com/microfluidic-mixing/|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is typically at sizes from a couple (2 or 3) millimeters down to the nanometer range.  At this size range normal convection does not happen unless you force it.  Diffusion is the dominate mechanism whereby two different fluids come together.  Diffusion is a relatively slow process.  Hence a number of researchers had to devise ways to get the two fluids to mix.  This involved Y junctions, T junctions, three-way intersections and designs where the interfacial area between the two fluids is maximized.  Beyond just interfacing the two liquids people also made twisting channels to force the two fluids to mix.  These included multilayered devices where the fluids would corkscrew, looped devices where the fluids would flow around obstructions and wavy devices where the channel would constrict and flare out.  Additionally channels with features on the walls like notches or groves were tried.\n\nOne way to tell if mixing is happening due to convection or diffusion is by finding the Peclet number. It is the ratio of convection to diffusion.  At high Peclet numbers, convection dominates.  At low Peclet numbers, diffusion dominates.\n\nPeclet = flow velocity * mixing path / diffusion coefficient\n\n==Industrial mixing equipment==\nAt an industrial scale, efficient mixing can be difficult to achieve. A great deal of engineering effort goes into designing and improving mixing processes. Mixing at industrial scale is done in batches (dynamic mixing), inline or with help of [[static mixer]]s. Moving mixers are powered with [[electric motor]]s that operate at standard speeds of 1800 or 1500 RPM, which is typically much faster than necessary. [[Gearbox]]es are used to reduce speed and increase torque.  Some applications require the use of multi-shaft mixers, in which a combination of mixer types are used to completely blend the product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockmeyer.com/products/high-viscosity-mixers/dual-triple-shaft-mixer-detail.html |title=High Viscosity Mixers: Dual and Triple Shaft Mixers |publisher=Hockmeyer.com |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703141729/http://www.hockmeyer.com/products/high-viscosity-mixers/dual-triple-shaft-mixer-detail.html |archivedate=3 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to performing typical batch mixing operations, some mixing can be done continuously.  Using a machine like the Continuous Processor, one or more dry ingredients and one or more liquid ingredients can be accurately and consistently metered into the machine and see a continuous, homogeneous mixture come out the discharge of the machine.<ref>\"Continuous Processor\" http://www.dairynetwork.com/product.mvc/Continuous-Processor-0002</ref>  Many industries have converted to continuous mixing for many reasons.  Some of those are ease of cleaning, lower energy consumption, smaller footprint, versatility, control, and many others.  Continuous mixers, such as the twin-screw Continuous Processor, also have the ability to handle very high viscosities.\n\n===Turbines===\nA selection of turbine geometries and power numbers are shown below.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em\"\n|+ Selected Turbine Geometries and Power Numbers <br />\n!Name\n!Power number\n!Flow direction\n!Blade angle (degrees)\n!Number of blades\n!Blade geometry\n|-\n| [[Rushton turbine]] || 4.6 || Radial || 0 || 6 || Flat\n|-\n| Pitched blade turbine || 1.3 || Axial || 45\u201360 || 3\u20136 || Flat\n|-\n| Hydrofoil || 0.3 || Axial || 45\u201360 || 3\u20136 || Curved\n|-\n| Marine Propeller || 0.2 || Axial || N/A || 3 || Curved\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n|colspan=6 |\n|}\n\n[[File:Mixing - flusso assiale e radiale.jpg|thumb|200px|Axial flow impeller (left) and radial flow impeller (right).]]\n\nDifferent types of impellers are used for different tasks; for instance, [[Rushton turbine]]s are useful for dispersing gases into liquids, but are not very helpful for dispersing settled solids into liquid.

Anchor mixers induce solid-body rotation and do not promote vertical mixing, but helical ribbons do. Close clearance mixers are used in the laminar regime, because the viscosity of the fluid overwhelms the inertial forces of the flow and prevents the fluid leaving the impeller from entraining the fluid next to it. Helical ribbon mixers are typically rotated to push material at the wall downwards, which helps circulate the fluid and refresh the surface at the wall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc10.htm |title=Helical Ribbon Impeller |publisher=Bakker.org |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2017-06-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814180054/http://www.bakker.org/cfm/webdoc10.htm |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>.\n\n===High shear dispersers===\n{{main article|high-shear mixer}}\nHigh shear dispersers create intense shear near the impeller but relatively little flow in the bulk of the vessel.

Feige added that \"We didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\"<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\">{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |title=Introducing the New Marvel Studios Logo |last=Strom |first=Marc |date=November 12, 2013 |publisher=Marvel |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131115084009/http%3A//marvel%2Ecom/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |archive-date=November 15, 2013 |access-date=November 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, ultimately choosing 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\"<ref name=\"ImaginaryForces\" />\n\nThe new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] through ''Captain America: Civil War''. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by [[Brian Tyler]], who wrote the scores to ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor: The Dark World'', and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\" /> It was featured on the films ''Thor: The Dark World'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.\n\nIn July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by [[Michael Giacchino]], who composed the scores to ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''. The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings, but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |title=See the New Marvel Studios Logo and Intro from Comic-Con |last=Perry |first=Spencer |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725150336/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was first seen in front of ''Doctor Strange''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |title=SDCC: New Marvel Studios Logo and Opening Fanfare Revealed |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725181957/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The updated logo was created by Perception, who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the film making] process by touching on\" how a film's origins is inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of\u2026\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |title=Marvel Studios Logo |publisher=Perception |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204200932/http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |access-date=January 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017 [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |title=Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years Logo Unveiled at D23 |last=Hoffmeyer |first=Corey |date=July 15, 2017 |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716043557/http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |archive-date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The logo debuted with ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' on April 26, 2018 and was used again in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''.

Feige added that \"We didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\"<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\">{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |title=Introducing the New Marvel Studios Logo |last=Strom |first=Marc |date=November 12, 2013 |publisher=Marvel |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131115084009/http%3A//marvel%2Ecom/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |archive-date=November 15, 2013 |access-date=November 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, ultimately choosing 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\"<ref name=\"ImaginaryForces\" />\n\nThe new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] through ''Captain America: Civil War''. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by [[Brian Tyler]], who wrote the scores to ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor: The Dark World'', and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\" /> It was featured on the films ''Thor: The Dark World'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.\n\nIn July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by [[Michael Giacchino]], who composed the scores to ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''. The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings, but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |title=See the New Marvel Studios Logo and Intro from Comic-Con |last=Perry |first=Spencer |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725150336/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was first seen in front of ''Doctor Strange''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |title=SDCC: New Marvel Studios Logo and Opening Fanfare Revealed |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725181957/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The updated logo was created by Perception, who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the film making] process by touching on\" how a film's origins is inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of\u2026\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |title=Marvel Studios Logo |publisher=Perception |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204200932/http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |access-date=January 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017 [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |title=Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years Logo Unveiled at D23 |last=Hoffmeyer |first=Corey |date=July 15, 2017 |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716043557/http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |archive-date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The logo debuted with ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' on April 26, 2018 and was used again in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''.

Colonial militia laws\u2014and after independence those of the United States and the various states\u2014required able-bodied males to enroll in the militia, to undergo a minimum of military training, and to serve for limited periods of time in war or emergency. This earliest form of [[conscription]] involved selective drafts of militiamen for service in particular campaigns. Following this system in its essentials, the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year's service in the Continental army; this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks.\n\nFor long-term operations, conscription was occasionally used when volunteers or paid substitutes were insufficient to raise the needed manpower. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the states sometimes drafted men for militia duty or to fill state [[Continental Army]] units, but the central government did not have the authority to conscript except for purposes of [[Impressment#Continental Navy|naval impressment]]. Post Ratification of the Constitution, Article I.8.15, allows for Congress to conscript. Giving it the power to provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; Section 8.16 of the same article, allows Congress to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. Article II.2.1 makes the President the commander and chief of the militia. The second amendment protects the infringement of the militia regulations, being necessary to the security of a free state. The Second Militia act of 1792 defined the first group who could be called forth as all free able-bodied males between the ages of 18 and 45. President [[James Madison]] and his Secretary of War [[James Monroe]] unsuccessfully attempted to create a national draft of 40,000 men during the [[War of 1812]].<ref>John W.

The vast majority of troops were volunteers; of the 2,100,000 Union soldiers, about 2% were draftees, and another 6% were substitutes paid by draftees.<ref>Chambers, ed.

''Military Necessity: Civil-Military Relations in the Confederacy''. Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006.</ref> Resistance was both widespread and violent, with comparisons made between conscription and slavery.\n\n[[File:NYRiot.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rioters attacking a building during the [[New York City draft riots|New York anti-draft riots]] of 1863]]\nBoth sides permitted conscripts to hire substitutes to serve in their place. In the Union, many states and cities offered bounties and bonuses for enlistment. They also arranged to take credit against their draft quota by claiming freed slaves who enlisted in the Union Army.\n\nAlthough both sides resorted to conscription, the system did not work effectively in either.<ref>Arnold Shankman, \"Draft Resistance in Civil War Pennsylvania.\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' (1977): 190-204. [http://journals.psu.edu/index.php/pmhb/article/viewFile/43334/43055 online]</ref> The [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]] on April 16, 1862, passed an act requiring military service for three years from all males aged 18 to 35 not legally exempt; it later extended the obligation. The U.S. Congress followed with the [[Militia Act of 1862]] authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This state-administered system failed in practice and in 1863 Congress passed the [[Enrollment Act]], the first genuine national conscription law, setting up under the Union Army an elaborate machine for enrolling and drafting men between twenty and forty-five years of age. Quotas were assigned in each state, the deficiencies in volunteers required to be met by conscription.\n\nStill, men drafted could provide substitutes, and until mid-1864 could even avoid service by paying commutation money. Many eligible men pooled their money to cover the cost of any one of them drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which member should go into the army and which would stay home. The other popular means of procuring a substitute was to pay a soldier whose period of enlistment was about to expire\u2014the advantage of this method was that the Army could retain a trained veteran in place of a raw recruit. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union Army through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, and the [[New York City draft riots]] were in direct response to the draft and were the first large-scale resistance against the draft in the United States.\n\nThe problem of Confederate desertion was aggravated by the inequitable inclinations of conscription officers and local judges. The three conscription acts of the Confederacy exempted certain categories, most notably the [[Plantations in the American South#Planter (plantation owner)|planter class]], and enrolling officers and local judges often practiced favoritism, sometimes accepting bribes. Attempts to effectively deal with the issue were frustrated by conflict between state and local governments on the one hand and the national government of the Confederacy.<ref>Moore 1924</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n\n[[File:King, Stoddard WW1 draft card.jpg|thumb|[[World War I]] era draft card belonging to writer [[Stoddard King]] ]]\n\nIn 1917 the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [[World War I]] when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1&nbsp;million target in the first six weeks of the war.<ref>Howard Zinn, ''People's History of the United States''. (Harper Collins, 2003): 134</ref> One ascribed motivation was to head off the former President, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who proposed to raise a volunteer division, which would upstage Wilson; however, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had the support to carry out that plan, and also, since Wilson had just started his second term in office the former President's prospects for substantial political gain would seem dubious.\n\nThe [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and\u2014by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples\u2014to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort. The act established a \"liability for military service of all male citizens\"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Administration was entrusted to local boards composed of leading civilians in each community. These boards issued draft calls in order of numbers drawn in a national lottery and determined exemptions.\n\nIn 1917, 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3&nbsp;million inducted into the military services, with little of the resistance that characterized the Civil War, thanks to a well-received campaign by the government to increase support for the war, and shut down newspapers and magazines that published articles against the war.<ref>Chambers (1987)</ref><ref>Zinn (2003)</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. draft lottery.jpg|thumb| Secretary of War [[Newton Baker]] draws the first draft number on July 20, 1917.]]\n\nThe draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13.0% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (86.9%). Along with a general opposition to American involvement in a foreign conflict, Southern farmers objected to perceived unfair conscription practices that exempted members of the upper class and industrial workers.\n\nDraft boards were localized and based their decisions on social class: the poorest were the most often conscripted because they were considered the least likely to be the skilled labor needed for the war effort. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} African-Americans in particular were often disproportionately drafted, though they generally were conscripted as laborers and not sent into combat to avoid the tensions that would arise from mixing races in military units. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and some communities in isolationist areas even sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes.\n\nNearly half a million immigrants were drafted, which forced the military to develop training procedures that took ethnic differences into account. Military leaders invited Progressive reformers and ethnic group leaders to assist in formulating new military policies. The military attempted to socialize and Americanize young immigrant recruits, not by forcing \"angloconformity\", but by showing remarkable sensitivity and respect for ethnic values and traditions and a concern for the morale of immigrant troops, with the aim of blending them into the larger society. Sports activities, keeping immigrant groups together, newspapers in various languages, the assistance of bilingual officers, and ethnic entertainment programs were all employed.<ref>Nancy Ford, ''Americans all!: foreign-born soldiers in World War&nbsp;I'' (2001)</ref>\n\n====Opposition====\n[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' by [[George Bellows]], ''[[The Masses]]'', 1917|432x432px]]\nThe Conscription Act of 1917 was passed in June. Conscripts were [[court-martial]]ed by the Army if they refused to wear uniforms, bear arms, perform basic duties, or submit to military authority. Convicted objectors were often given long sentences of 20 years in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Fort Leavenworth]].<ref>Chambers, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) p. 218</ref> In 1918 Secretary Baker created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors' sincerity.{{sfn|Shenk|2005|p=62}} [[Military tribunals in the United States|Military tribunals]] tried men found by the Board to be insincere for a variety of offenses, sentencing 17 to [[capital punishment|death]], 142 to [[life imprisonment]], and 345 to [[penal labor]] camps.{{sfn|Shenk|2005|p=62}} Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.\n\nIn 1917, a number of radicals and [[anarchists]], including [[Emma Goldman]], tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on January 7, 1918. The decision said the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. The Court, relying partly on [[Emerich de Vattel|Vattel]]'s [[The Law of Nations]], emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:<ref>Chambers, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219\u2013220</ref>\n\n{{quote|It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need, and the right to compel it. To do more than state the proposition is absolutely unnecessary in view of the practical illustration afforded by the almost universal legislation to that effect now in force.}}\n\nConscription was unpopular from left-wing sectors at the start, with many Socialists jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". The most famous was [[Eugene Debs]], head of the [[Socialist Party of America]], who ran for president in 1920 from his [[Atlanta]] prison cell. He had his sentence commuted to [[time served]] and was released on December 25, 1921, by President [[Warren G. Harding]]. Also notably, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] attempted to obstruct the war effort through strikes in war-related industries and not registering, but it did not meet with large success.\n\nAlthough draft riots were not widespread, an estimated 171,000 people never registered for the draft while another 360,000 people never responded to induction orders, totaling to around 20% of all eligible draftees.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Force|first=United States President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdelqRn46SgC|title=Studies Prepared for the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force|date=1971|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=III-1-22 to III-1-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Conscientious objectors====\n[[Conscientious objector]] (CO) exemptions were allowed for the [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Quakers]], and [[Church of the Brethren]] only.

About 80% of the 21,000 decided to abandon their objection and take up arms,<ref name=\":1\" /> but 3,989 drafted objectors refused to serve.

The 1940 law instituted conscription in peacetime, requiring the registration of all men between 18 and 25, to be automatically conscripted. President Roosevelt's signing of the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Training and Service Act]] on September 16, 1940, began the first peacetime draft in the United States. It also reestablished the [[Selective Service System]] as an independent agency responsible for identifying young men and facilitating their military service. Roosevelt named Lewis B. Hershey to head the System on July 31, 1941, where he remained until 1969.<ref name=Flynn1985 /> This act came when other preparations, such as increased training and equipment production, had not yet been approved. Nevertheless, it served as the basis for the conscription programs that would continue to the present.\n\nThe act set a cap of 900,000 men to be in training at any given time, and limited military service to 12 months unless Congress deemed it necessary to extend such service in the interest of national defense. An amendment added 18 more months to this service period on August 18, 1941. After Pearl Harbor the STSA was further amended (December 19, 1941), extending the term of service to the duration of the war plus six months and requiring the registration of all men 18 to 64 years of age. During World War&nbsp;II, 49 million men were registered, 36 million classified,{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and 10 million inducted.<ref>George Q. Flynn, ''The Draft, 1940\u20131973''.

By late 1942, the Selective Service System moved away from a national lottery to administrative selection by its more than 6,000 [[Draft board|local boards]].\n\nOn December 5, 1942, presidential [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 9279 made it so that all men from the ages of 18 to 37 could not voluntarily enlist for the duration of the war, providing protection for the nation's home front manpower pool. The [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] began procuring their personnel through the Selective Service System in early 1943. The Navy and Marine Corps enlisted inductees and volunteers under the same service agreements, but with different service obligations, while the Army placed wartime inductees and volunteers into a special service component known as the [[Army of the United States]], commonly known as the \"AUS\"; service commitments were set at the length of the war plus six months.<ref>Clifford, J., & Spencer, S.

Organized draft resistance also developed in the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese American internment camps]], where groups like the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]] refused to serve unless they and their families were released. 300 [[Nisei]] men from eight of the ten [[War Relocation Authority]] camps were arrested and stood trial for felony [[draft evasion]]; most were sentenced to federal prison.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Eric L. |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Draft%20resistance/ |title=Draft resistance |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 27, 2014}}</ref> American Communists also opposed the war by forming the \"American Peace Committee\", which tried to organize a coalition of anti-war groups.

From a program that had just barely passed congressional muster during the fearful prelude to World War&nbsp;II, a more robust draft continued as fears now focused on the Soviet threat. Nevertheless, some dissenting voices in Congress continued to appeal to the history of voluntary American military service as preferable for a democracy.<ref>Gilliam, R. (1982).

That the Depression had resulted in a substantial reduction of the [[birth rate]] was frequently pointed out by Hershey and other supporters of the draft to back up their doubts regarding the wisdom of returning to an all-volunteer military at a time when it was known that the number of men reaching military age was going to fall significantly. The Korean War was the first time any form of student deferment was used. During the Korean War a student carrying at least twelve semester hours was spared until the end of his current semester.<ref name=Myra>{{cite book|title=Long Time Passing, New Edition: Vietnam and the Haunted Generation|author=Myra MacPherson|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|year=2001|page=92}}</ref>\n\nThe United States breathed easier with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean War Armistice]] on July 27, 1953; however, technology brought new promises and threats. U.S. air and nuclear power fueled the Eisenhower doctrine of \"massive retaliation\". This strategy demanded more machines and fewer foot soldiers, so the draft slipped to the back burner. However, the head of the SSS, Maj. Gen. Hershey, urged caution fearing the conflict looming in Vietnam. In May 1953, he told his state directors to do everything possible to keep SSS alive in order to meet upcoming needs.<ref>Hershey, 1953</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1953 Korean War Armistice, Congress passed the [[Reserve Forces Act of 1955]] with the aim of improving National Guard and federal Reserve Component readiness while also constraining its use by the president. Towards this end, it mandated a six-year service commitment, in a combination of reserve and active duty time, for every line military member regardless of their means of entry. Meanwhile, the SSS kept itself alive by devising and managing a complex system of deferments for a swelling pool of candidates during a period of shrinking requirements. The greatest challenge to the draft came not from protesters but rather lobbyists seeking additional deferments for their constituency groups such as scientists and farmers.<ref name=Flynn1985 />\n\nGovernment leaders felt the potential for a draft was a critical element in maintaining a constant flow of volunteers. On numerous occasions Gen. Hershey told Congress for every man drafted, three or four more were scared into volunteering.<ref>House Committee on Appropriations Hearings, 1958.</ref> Assuming his assessment was accurate, this would mean over 11 million men volunteered for service because of the draft between January 1954 and April 1975.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nThe policy of using the draft as force to compel \"voluntary\" enlistment was unique in U.S. history. Previous drafts had not aimed at encouraging individuals to sign up in order to gain preferential placement or less dangerous postings. However, the incremental buildup of Vietnam without a clear threat to the country bolstered this.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Some estimates suggest conscription encompassed almost one-third of all eligible men during the period of 1965\u201369.<ref>Chambers, J.

This process, known as channeling, helped push men into educational, occupational, and family choices they might not otherwise have pursued. Undergraduate degrees were valued. Graduate work had varying value over time, though technical and religious training received near constant support. War industry support in the form of teaching, research, or skilled labor also received deferred or exempt status. Finally, marriage and family were exempted because of its positive social consequences.<ref name=Flynn1985 /><ref>Marmion, H. (1968). ''Selective Service: Conflict and Compromise.''

While a far smaller percentage of eligible males were conscripted compared to war periods, draftees by law served in the Army for two years. [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Willie Mays]] were two of the most famous people drafted during this period.\n\nPublic protests in the United States were few during the Korean War. However, the percentage of CO exemptions for inductees grew to 1.5% compared to a rate of just 0.5% in the past two wars.

Hershey needed to visit the Oval Office. From that visit emerged two wishes of JFK with regard to conscription. The first was that the names of married men with children should occupy the very bottom of the callup list. Just above them should be the names of men who were married. This Presidential policy, however, was not to be formally encoded into Selective Service Status. Men who fit into these categories became known as Kennedy Husbands. When President Lyndon Johnson decided to rescind this Kennedy policy, there was a last-minute rush to the altar by thousands of American couples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/09/23/a-rush-to-the-altar-to-avoid-the-vietnam-draft-the-day-lbj-eliminated-the-marriage-exemption/|title=A rush to wed to avoid the Vietnam draft: The day LBJ eliminated the marriage exemption|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>\n\nMany early rank-and-file anti-conscription protesters had been allied with the National Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy.

The catalyst for protest reconnection was the 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]].\n\nConsequently, there was some opposition to the draft even before the major U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] began. The large cohort of [[Baby Boomers]] who became eligible for military service during the Vietnam War was responsible for a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college students. Besides being able to avoid the draft, college graduates who volunteered for military service (primarily as [[commissioned officers]]) had a much better chance of securing a preferential posting compared to less-educated inductees.\n\n[[File:GeraldFordDraft.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Gerald Ford]] announces amnesty for draft evaders at the White House, Washington, D.C., in 1974.]]\nAs U.S. troop strength in South Vietnam increased, more young men were drafted for service there, and many of those still at home sought means of avoiding the draft. Since only 15,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers were sent to South Vietnam, enlistment in the Guard or the Reserves became a popular means of avoiding serving in a war zone. For those who could meet the more stringent enlistment standards, service in the Air Force, Navy, or Coast Guard was a means of reducing the chances of being killed.

For several years, students were required to take an annual qualification test. In 1967 educational deferments were changed for graduate students. Those starting graduate studies in the fall of 1967 were given two semester deferments becoming eligible in June 1968. Those further along in their graduate study who entered prior to the summer of 1967 could continue to receive a deferment until they completed their studies. Peace Corps Volunteers were no longer given deferments and their induction was left to the discretion of their local boards. However most boards allowed Peace Corps Volunteers to complete their two years assignment before inducting them into the service. On December 1, 1969, a [[Draft lottery (1969)|lottery]] was held to establish a draft priority for all those born between 1944 and 1950.

The Court summarized the history of conscription in [[England]] and in colonial America, a history that it read as establishing that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] envisioned compulsory military service as a governmental power. It held that the Constitution's grant to Congress of the powers to declare war and to create standing armies included the power to mandate conscription. It rejected arguments based on states' rights, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]], and other provisions of the Constitution.\n\nLater, during the Vietnam War, a lower [[United States court of appeals|appellate court]] also concluded that the draft was constitutional.

Douglas]], in voting to hear the appeal in ''Holmes'', agreed that the government had the authority to employ conscription in wartime, but argued that the constitutionality of a draft in the absence of a declaration of war was an open question, which the Supreme Court should address.\n\nDuring the World War&nbsp;I era, the Supreme Court allowed the government great latitude in suppressing criticism of the draft. Examples include ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', 249 U.S. 47 (1919)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=249&page=47 |title=''Schenck v.

Thus, in 1971 the Court held it unconstitutional for a state to punish a man who entered a county courthouse wearing a jacket with the words \"Fuck the Draft\" visible on it. ''[[Cohen v.

Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG)'', 468 U.S. 841 (1984), upholding the Constitutionality of the first of the federal \"[[Solomon Amendment]]\" laws, which requires applicants for Federal student aid to certify that they have complied with draft registration, either by having registered or by not being required to register; ''Wayte v.

The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's \"decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women\", that \"since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause\", and that \"the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.{{'\"}}<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0453_0057_ZS.html ''Rostker v.

According to the SSS, after a person is drafted, he can claim [[conscientious objector]] status and then justify it before the Local Board. This is criticized because during the times of a draft, when the country is in emergency conditions, there could be increased pressure for Local Boards to be more harsh on conscientious objector claims.\n\nThere are two types of status for conscientious objectors. If a person objects only to combat but not to service in the military, then the person could be given noncombatant service in the military without training of [[weapons]]. If the person objects to all military service, then the person could be ordered to \"[[Alternative Service Program|alternative service]]\" with a job \"deemed to make a meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health, safety, and interest\".\n\n==\"Poverty draft\"==\nThe \"poverty draft\" is a term describing U.S. military recruiters' purposeful tendency to focus their recruiting efforts on inner-city and poor rural schools.

Following this system in its essentials, the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year's service in the Continental army; this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks.\n\nFor long-term operations, conscription was occasionally used when volunteers or paid substitutes were insufficient to raise the needed manpower. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the states sometimes drafted men for militia duty or to fill state [[Continental Army]] units, but the central government did not have the authority to conscript except for purposes of [[Impressment#Continental Navy|naval impressment]]. Post Ratification of the Constitution, Article I.8.15, allows for Congress to conscript. Giving it the power to provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; Section 8.16 of the same article, allows Congress to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. Article II.2.1 makes the President the commander and chief of the militia. The second amendment protects the infringement of the militia regulations, being necessary to the security of a free state. The Second Militia act of 1792 defined the first group who could be called forth as all free able-bodied males between the ages of 18 and 45. President [[James Madison]] and his Secretary of War [[James Monroe]] unsuccessfully attempted to create a national draft of 40,000 men during the [[War of 1812]].<ref>John W.

In the Union, many states and cities offered bounties and bonuses for enlistment. They also arranged to take credit against their draft quota by claiming freed slaves who enlisted in the Union Army.\n\nAlthough both sides resorted to conscription, the system did not work effectively in either.<ref>Arnold Shankman, \"Draft Resistance in Civil War Pennsylvania.\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' (1977): 190-204. [http://journals.psu.edu/index.php/pmhb/article/viewFile/43334/43055 online]</ref> The [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]] on April 16, 1862, passed an act requiring military service for three years from all males aged 18 to 35 not legally exempt; it later extended the obligation. The U.S. Congress followed with the [[Militia Act of 1862]] authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This state-administered system failed in practice and in 1863 Congress passed the [[Enrollment Act]], the first genuine national conscription law, setting up under the Union Army an elaborate machine for enrolling and drafting men between twenty and forty-five years of age. Quotas were assigned in each state, the deficiencies in volunteers required to be met by conscription.\n\nStill, men drafted could provide substitutes, and until mid-1864 could even avoid service by paying commutation money. Many eligible men pooled their money to cover the cost of any one of them drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which member should go into the army and which would stay home. The other popular means of procuring a substitute was to pay a soldier whose period of enlistment was about to expire\u2014the advantage of this method was that the Army could retain a trained veteran in place of a raw recruit. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union Army through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, and the [[New York City draft riots]] were in direct response to the draft and were the first large-scale resistance against the draft in the United States.\n\nThe problem of Confederate desertion was aggravated by the inequitable inclinations of conscription officers and local judges. The three conscription acts of the Confederacy exempted certain categories, most notably the [[Plantations in the American South#Planter (plantation owner)|planter class]], and enrolling officers and local judges often practiced favoritism, sometimes accepting bribes. Attempts to effectively deal with the issue were frustrated by conflict between state and local governments on the one hand and the national government of the Confederacy.<ref>Moore 1924</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n\n[[File:King, Stoddard WW1 draft card.jpg|thumb|[[World War I]] era draft card belonging to writer [[Stoddard King]] ]]\n\nIn 1917 the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [[World War I]] when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1&nbsp;million target in the first six weeks of the war.<ref>Howard Zinn, ''People's History of the United States''. (Harper Collins, 2003): 134</ref> One ascribed motivation was to head off the former President, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who proposed to raise a volunteer division, which would upstage Wilson; however, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had the support to carry out that plan, and also, since Wilson had just started his second term in office the former President's prospects for substantial political gain would seem dubious.\n\nThe [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and\u2014by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples\u2014to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort. The act established a \"liability for military service of all male citizens\"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Administration was entrusted to local boards composed of leading civilians in each community. These boards issued draft calls in order of numbers drawn in a national lottery and determined exemptions.\n\nIn 1917, 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3&nbsp;million inducted into the military services, with little of the resistance that characterized the Civil War, thanks to a well-received campaign by the government to increase support for the war, and shut down newspapers and magazines that published articles against the war.<ref>Chambers (1987)</ref><ref>Zinn (2003)</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. draft lottery.jpg|thumb| Secretary of War [[Newton Baker]] draws the first draft number on July 20, 1917.]]\n\nThe draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13.0% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (86.9%). Along with a general opposition to American involvement in a foreign conflict, Southern farmers objected to perceived unfair conscription practices that exempted members of the upper class and industrial workers.\n\nDraft boards were localized and based their decisions on social class: the poorest were the most often conscripted because they were considered the least likely to be the skilled labor needed for the war effort. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} African-Americans in particular were often disproportionately drafted, though they generally were conscripted as laborers and not sent into combat to avoid the tensions that would arise from mixing races in military units. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and some communities in isolationist areas even sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes.\n\nNearly half a million immigrants were drafted, which forced the military to develop training procedures that took ethnic differences into account. Military leaders invited Progressive reformers and ethnic group leaders to assist in formulating new military policies. The military attempted to socialize and Americanize young immigrant recruits, not by forcing \"angloconformity\", but by showing remarkable sensitivity and respect for ethnic values and traditions and a concern for the morale of immigrant troops, with the aim of blending them into the larger society. Sports activities, keeping immigrant groups together, newspapers in various languages, the assistance of bilingual officers, and ethnic entertainment programs were all employed.<ref>Nancy Ford, ''Americans all!: foreign-born soldiers in World War&nbsp;I'' (2001)</ref>\n\n====Opposition====\n[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' by [[George Bellows]], ''[[The Masses]]'', 1917|432x432px]]\nThe Conscription Act of 1917 was passed in June. Conscripts were [[court-martial]]ed by the Army if they refused to wear uniforms, bear arms, perform basic duties, or submit to military authority. Convicted objectors were often given long sentences of 20 years in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Fort Leavenworth]].<ref>Chambers, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) p. 218</ref> In 1918 Secretary Baker created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors' sincerity.{{sfn|Shenk|2005|p=62}} [[Military tribunals in the United States|Military tribunals]] tried men found by the Board to be insincere for a variety of offenses, sentencing 17 to [[capital punishment|death]], 142 to [[life imprisonment]], and 345 to [[penal labor]] camps.{{sfn|Shenk|2005|p=62}} Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.\n\nIn 1917, a number of radicals and [[anarchists]], including [[Emma Goldman]], tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on January 7, 1918. The decision said the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. The Court, relying partly on [[Emerich de Vattel|Vattel]]'s [[The Law of Nations]], emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:<ref>Chambers, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219\u2013220</ref>\n\n{{quote|It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need, and the right to compel it.

The most famous was [[Eugene Debs]], head of the [[Socialist Party of America]], who ran for president in 1920 from his [[Atlanta]] prison cell. He had his sentence commuted to [[time served]] and was released on December 25, 1921, by President [[Warren G. Harding]]. Also notably, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] attempted to obstruct the war effort through strikes in war-related industries and not registering, but it did not meet with large success.\n\nAlthough draft riots were not widespread, an estimated 171,000 people never registered for the draft while another 360,000 people never responded to induction orders, totaling to around 20% of all eligible draftees.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Force|first=United States President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdelqRn46SgC|title=Studies Prepared for the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force|date=1971|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=III-1-22 to III-1-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Conscientious objectors====\n[[Conscientious objector]] (CO) exemptions were allowed for the [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Quakers]], and [[Church of the Brethren]] only.

The 1940 law instituted conscription in peacetime, requiring the registration of all men between 18 and 25, to be automatically conscripted. President Roosevelt's signing of the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Training and Service Act]] on September 16, 1940, began the first peacetime draft in the United States. It also reestablished the [[Selective Service System]] as an independent agency responsible for identifying young men and facilitating their military service. Roosevelt named Lewis B. Hershey to head the System on July 31, 1941, where he remained until 1969.<ref name=Flynn1985 /> This act came when other preparations, such as increased training and equipment production, had not yet been approved. Nevertheless, it served as the basis for the conscription programs that would continue to the present.\n\nThe act set a cap of 900,000 men to be in training at any given time, and limited military service to 12 months unless Congress deemed it necessary to extend such service in the interest of national defense. An amendment added 18 more months to this service period on August 18, 1941. After Pearl Harbor the STSA was further amended (December 19, 1941), extending the term of service to the duration of the war plus six months and requiring the registration of all men 18 to 64 years of age. During World War&nbsp;II, 49 million men were registered, 36 million classified,{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and 10 million inducted.<ref>George Q. Flynn, ''The Draft, 1940\u20131973''.

The [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] began procuring their personnel through the Selective Service System in early 1943. The Navy and Marine Corps enlisted inductees and volunteers under the same service agreements, but with different service obligations, while the Army placed wartime inductees and volunteers into a special service component known as the [[Army of the United States]], commonly known as the \"AUS\"; service commitments were set at the length of the war plus six months.<ref>Clifford, J., & Spencer, S.

In May 1953, he told his state directors to do everything possible to keep SSS alive in order to meet upcoming needs.<ref>Hershey, 1953</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1953 Korean War Armistice, Congress passed the [[Reserve Forces Act of 1955]] with the aim of improving National Guard and federal Reserve Component readiness while also constraining its use by the president. Towards this end, it mandated a six-year service commitment, in a combination of reserve and active duty time, for every line military member regardless of their means of entry. Meanwhile, the SSS kept itself alive by devising and managing a complex system of deferments for a swelling pool of candidates during a period of shrinking requirements. The greatest challenge to the draft came not from protesters but rather lobbyists seeking additional deferments for their constituency groups such as scientists and farmers.<ref name=Flynn1985 />\n\nGovernment leaders felt the potential for a draft was a critical element in maintaining a constant flow of volunteers. On numerous occasions Gen. Hershey told Congress for every man drafted, three or four more were scared into volunteering.<ref>House Committee on Appropriations Hearings, 1958.</ref> Assuming his assessment was accurate, this would mean over 11 million men volunteered for service because of the draft between January 1954 and April 1975.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nThe policy of using the draft as force to compel \"voluntary\" enlistment was unique in U.S. history. Previous drafts had not aimed at encouraging individuals to sign up in order to gain preferential placement or less dangerous postings. However, the incremental buildup of Vietnam without a clear threat to the country bolstered this.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Some estimates suggest conscription encompassed almost one-third of all eligible men during the period of 1965\u201369.<ref>Chambers, J.

This process, known as channeling, helped push men into educational, occupational, and family choices they might not otherwise have pursued. Undergraduate degrees were valued. Graduate work had varying value over time, though technical and religious training received near constant support. War industry support in the form of teaching, research, or skilled labor also received deferred or exempt status. Finally, marriage and family were exempted because of its positive social consequences.<ref name=Flynn1985 /><ref>Marmion, H. (1968). ''Selective Service: Conflict and Compromise.''

Hershey).</ref>\n\nIn the only extended period of military conscription of U.S. males during a major peacetime period, the draft continued on a more limited basis during the late 1950s and early 1960s. While a far smaller percentage of eligible males were conscripted compared to war periods, draftees by law served in the Army for two years. [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Willie Mays]] were two of the most famous people drafted during this period.\n\nPublic protests in the United States were few during the Korean War. However, the percentage of CO exemptions for inductees grew to 1.5% compared to a rate of just 0.5% in the past two wars. The Justice Department also investigated more than 80,000 draft evasion cases.<ref name=Flynn2000 /><ref>Chambers, 1987</ref><ref>Kohn, S. (1986).

Hershey needed to visit the Oval Office. From that visit emerged two wishes of JFK with regard to conscription. The first was that the names of married men with children should occupy the very bottom of the callup list. Just above them should be the names of men who were married. This Presidential policy, however, was not to be formally encoded into Selective Service Status. Men who fit into these categories became known as Kennedy Husbands. When President Lyndon Johnson decided to rescind this Kennedy policy, there was a last-minute rush to the altar by thousands of American couples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/09/23/a-rush-to-the-altar-to-avoid-the-vietnam-draft-the-day-lbj-eliminated-the-marriage-exemption/|title=A rush to wed to avoid the Vietnam draft: The day LBJ eliminated the marriage exemption|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>\n\nMany early rank-and-file anti-conscription protesters had been allied with the National Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy. The completion in 1963 of a Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty left a mass of undirected youth in search of a cause.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Syndicated cartoonist [[Al Capp]] portrayed them as S.W.I.N.E, (Students Wildly Indignant About Nearly Everything). The catalyst for protest reconnection was the 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]].\n\nConsequently, there was some opposition to the draft even before the major U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] began. The large cohort of [[Baby Boomers]] who became eligible for military service during the Vietnam War was responsible for a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college students. Besides being able to avoid the draft, college graduates who volunteered for military service (primarily as [[commissioned officers]]) had a much better chance of securing a preferential posting compared to less-educated inductees.\n\n[[File:GeraldFordDraft.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Gerald Ford]] announces amnesty for draft evaders at the White House, Washington, D.C., in 1974.]]\nAs U.S. troop strength in South Vietnam increased, more young men were drafted for service there, and many of those still at home sought means of avoiding the draft. Since only 15,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers were sent to South Vietnam, enlistment in the Guard or the Reserves became a popular means of avoiding serving in a war zone. For those who could meet the more stringent enlistment standards, service in the Air Force, Navy, or Coast Guard was a means of reducing the chances of being killed. Vocations to the ministry and the rabbinate soared, because divinity students were exempt from the draft.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Doctors and [[draft board]] members found themselves being pressured by relatives or family friends to exempt potential draftees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe marriage deferment ended suddenly on August 26, 1965.

For several years, students were required to take an annual qualification test. In 1967 educational deferments were changed for graduate students. Those starting graduate studies in the fall of 1967 were given two semester deferments becoming eligible in June 1968. Those further along in their graduate study who entered prior to the summer of 1967 could continue to receive a deferment until they completed their studies. Peace Corps Volunteers were no longer given deferments and their induction was left to the discretion of their local boards. However most boards allowed Peace Corps Volunteers to complete their two years assignment before inducting them into the service. On December 1, 1969, a [[Draft lottery (1969)|lottery]] was held to establish a draft priority for all those born between 1944 and 1950. Those with a high number no longer had to be concerned about the draft.

According to the SSS, after a person is drafted, he can claim [[conscientious objector]] status and then justify it before the Local Board. This is criticized because during the times of a draft, when the country is in emergency conditions, there could be increased pressure for Local Boards to be more harsh on conscientious objector claims.\n\nThere are two types of status for conscientious objectors. If a person objects only to combat but not to service in the military, then the person could be given noncombatant service in the military without training of [[weapons]]. If the person objects to all military service, then the person could be ordered to \"[[Alternative Service Program|alternative service]]\" with a job \"deemed to make a meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health, safety, and interest\".\n\n==\"Poverty draft\"==\nThe \"poverty draft\" is a term describing U.S. military recruiters' purposeful tendency to focus their recruiting efforts on inner-city and poor rural schools.

They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]] and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref> In 2020 it became officially canon that Bugs Bunny was a struggling rapist after Warner Brothers attained the rights to a popular YouTube video made by MeatCanyon which depicted Bugs attempting to have his way with Elmer Fudd. He was stopped by his father. The video has since been removed from YouTube.\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.

They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros.

Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements.

Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.

It presents the story of a musical girl group that ends up breaking apart due to individual issues each member faces.

Stix, Sparkle's love interest and the group's manager, is able to help bring the group from \"amateur nights to brief stardom before tragedy (dope, melancholia, the wrong man)\" ensues and the group splits.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McKinnon|first1=George|title=Mayfield tunes lend polish to Sparkle|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=April 10, 1976}}</ref> Stix gives up on his music career and leaves the city and thus breaking Sparkle's heart. Sister is in an abusive relationship and is hung up on drugs while Delores leaves the city in pursuit of racial equality.

The early 1960s consisted of freedom music, a direct descendant of gospel music. This genre was aimed at building strong relationships during difficult times by connecting people. [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Freedom Singers]] are an example of these artists. The late 1960s to early 1970s consisted of [[soul music]] which tied in with historical macro events such as: Middle Civil Rights Movement, [[Great Society]], [[Vietnam War]], and [[Black Power]]. Soul music encourages everyone to be happy. Some influential artists during this time were [[James Brown]], [[The Supremes]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Marvin Gaye]], and [[Stevie Wonder]]. Next, the mid 1970s consisted of [[funk music]]. These songs were political and group focused. Some of these artists include [[Earth Wind and Fire]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Parliament Funkadelic]], [[Kool & The Gang]], [[Labelle]], and [[Chaka Khan]].  Finally, the middle to late 1970s consisted  of [[disco]] which was essentially peppy dance music. Stand out artists include [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Donna Summer]]. Within these genres, there are themes of self-determination, racial pride, and having fun. Sparkle captured all these themes as it spans musical genres. All the songs were adapted to the sound of the times, making the film relevant and powerful. \n[[Aretha Franklin]] had a large role with the music that was featured in the film. She even has an entire album called \"Sparkle.\" The other songs in the film were written by Curtis Mayfield. The songs were a huge hit.\n\n===Gender and sexuality===\nWhile analyzing gender and sexuality, the Black female protagonists in this film can easily be compared to the women in ''[[Cleopatra Jones]]'' and ''[[Coffy]]''. Unlike these films, Sparkle\u2019s protagonists do not come out on top in the same way as Cleo and Coffy do.\n\nCompared to Coffy and Cleo, these women are much more conservative in their looks and the way they convey themselves. Regarding female empowerment, their physical appearance is the only attribute they have and they use it as a tool. In other words, it is their only weapon. Coffy and Cleo both had actual guys and weapons at their disposal to use along with their physical appearance. Going off of this, the sisters are much weaker when looking at female empowerment, especially when there is Coffy and Cleo in the picture.\n\nIt is interesting how in Jacquie Jones' essay, ''Construction of Black Sexuality'', \u201cthe Black male character, as defined through his sexual behavior, is not able to overcome the problematic of domination which begins with a denial of dependency. Instead, the Black male character can only define himself through violent separateness\u201d (250).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diawara|first1=ed. by Manthia|title=Black American cinema|url=https://archive.org/details/blackamericancin00diaw|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-90397-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackamericancin00diaw/page/247 247\u2013256]}}</ref> One very disturbing scene in the film was when Sister and her boyfriend Satin are lying together on a bed. To get a coat, Satin tells sister she has to crawl. Sister does not think he is serious, so he angrily says it again. Satin then begins to brutally punch Sister. When Sister goes to her next performance, her other sisters realize that she has been beaten by Satin. They encourage her to leave him but she just brushes off the violence as it is no big deal; she believes she can just cover up the bruises with makeup and it will be better.\n\n[[Darlene Clark Hine]]'s ''A Shining Thread of Hope'' brought up the fact that after women joined the Black Power movements, men felt lesser of themselves as they could not protect and support their families. Hine states that \u201cThe Black Power movement reacted to this reality with an extreme emphasis on masculinity and an expectation that women would assume traditional female roles as a way of supporting black manhood. And yet, women in these organizations actually managed to make greater progress in some ways than they had in more traditional civil rights groups\u201d (298).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Darlene Clark|last2=Thompson|first2=Kathleen|title=A shining thread of hope the history of Black women in America|date=1999|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7679-0111-6|edition=1. paperback}}</ref> The reading also addresses 1976 as a time when things started to change in regards to sexual harassment being a crime. This all relates to black women and their position of power. \u201cThe terrible reality of their oppression by men of their own color [\u2026] was personal and political dynamite\u201d (302). Bringing this all together, Satin might have felt dominated by Sister and her success/potential success. It is unfortunate that Sister decides to brush it off but this goes with how she did not want to \u201clight the fuse\u201d of oppression by black men on black women.\n\n\"Blaxploitation films are notable for the ways they frequently situate \"normative\" black male identity amongst a variety of ideological \"others\" (women, homosexuals, other ethnicities) whose presence cannot simply be seen to solidify black manhood.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wlodarz|first1=Joe|title=Beyond the Black Macho: Queer Blaxploitation|journal=The Velvet Light Trap|date=2004|issue=53|pages=10\u201325}}</ref>\n\n===Black Power / blaxploitation===\nThe 1970s and the Women's Movement provide context for Black films like Sparkle. During this time, [[Title IX]] was instated and provided scholarships for female college athletes. In addition, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] of 1972 was a victory for women's suffrage that helped build a dialogue for black women and black women in films.\n\nDrugs, the Mafia, self-determination, and the ghetto are all apparent themes in Sparkle. \n[[Black Power]] in ''Sparkle'' is interesting in that there are no positive black male figures in the film. Every man is using women for things like sex, success, and their own selfish reasons. At one point, Jones even addresses black male sexuality and how they assume the role of a white man to achieve power over women.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diawara|first1=ed. by Manthia|title=Black American cinema|url=https://archive.org/details/blackamericancin00diaw|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-90397-4}}</ref> Going off of this, whites in this film are on the periphery and the focus is on the inner struggle between blacks. An example of this is the relationship between Sister and her boyfriend. Satin is an abusive man towards Sister who is involved with drugs and the Mafia. He is the source for all of Sisters' struggles as he pushes her into doing drugs and making her feel helpless as he beats her time and time again. Delores is an example of self-determination as she sees her sister Sister struggling, which makes her realize  that she needs to leave town and do things for herself. She is strong and independent enough to pick everything up and leave town, striving for a decent future. \nAccording to the Senior Vice President of Programming for [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] and Bravo, Frances Berwick, \"Blaxploitation films were some of the most experimental and daring films to come out of both the independent film scene and the studio system, [and] is one of the most ignored and under-appreciated.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holsey|first1=Steve|title=The 'blaxploitation' film era: What, if any, were its merits?|issue=46|publisher=Michigan Chronicle|date=August 7, 2002}}</ref> Blaxploitation includes several sub-types, musical being one of them, and where Sparkle fits in.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Sparkle'' was domestically released on April 7, 1976 with a running time of 98 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sparkle (1976) \u2013 Financial Information|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Sparkle-(1976)#tab=summary|website=www.the-numbers.com}}</ref> The film was unsuccessful at the box office grossing merely $4 million against a $1 million production budget.\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics, currently holding a 13% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1019541_sparkle?</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that \"somewhere along the line, there was made a decision to cheat\u2014to attempt an honest ghetto drama, but not enough to really go all the way into the characters; to keep the exploitative elements of casual dope and sex, but jump ahead to the convenient tragic results which can be seen on [[Television film|any TV feature]]; to explore the seedier side of the music business, but not enough to ever get beyond the titillations of pulp storytelling.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Sparkle (Color)|publisher=Variety|date=April 7, 1976}}</ref> Richard Eder said the film was a predictable sob story but that the main themes of the story are serious enough and credible.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eder|first1=Richard|title='Sparkle,' a Sob Story With Its Moments of Force||url=https://archive.org/stream/TheNewYorkTimes1976USAEnglish/Apr%2008%201976%2C%20The%20New%20York%20Times%2C%20%2343174%2C%20USA%20%28en%29#page/n41/mode/2up/search/Sparkle|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 8, 1976}}</ref> [[Dave Kehr]] stated that the film was \"[a] hackneyed, ho-hum 1976 feature about a black girl group, clearly modeled on the Supremes.\" [[FilmFour]] stated that \"[as] drab as it is, ''Sparkle''{{'}}s worth renting for Lonette McKee's performance and the cast renditions of Mayfield's songs. But if you're going to buy anything it should be [[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|the soundtrack album]].\" However, [[The Onion]]'s AV Club gave it a B- grade, calling it \"a rags-to-riches story that doesn't miss a stop along the well-trod ghetto-to-musical-charts path, but makes its journey with tuneful conviction.\"\n\n==Legacy==\nOf the people who appeared in the movie, [[Irene Cara]] became the film's breakout star: she went on to record many chart topping singles. [[Lonette McKee]] went on to other TV and film appearances with [[Richard Pryor]], including playing [[Denzel Washington]]'s on screen mother in ''[[Malcolm X]]'', and [[Dorian Harewood]] and [[Philip Michael Thomas]] did more TV and film appearances. Thomas would be famous as Ricardo Tubbs on the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]''.\n\n''Sparkle'' was previewed by an appreciative audience in Baltimore in March. The crowd of 1300 is said to have applauded, screamed and displayed loud attestation to their feelings that it was a good movie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Sherry|title=Sherry Martin: 'Sparkle' comes to Memphis|issue=22|publisher=Tri - State Defender|date=June 12, 1976}}</ref> It was viewed as a rather atypical Blaxploitation film for the day, illustrating \"that based on the nature, dignity, interests and ideals of man even blacks from the ghetto are capable of self-fulfillment and ehtical conduct without recourse to supernaturalism; in this case the super-stud, super-chick theory that is so common in the movies made primarily for the black movie goers today.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Sherry|title=Sherry Martin: 'Sparkle' comes to Memphis|issue=22|publisher=Tri-State Defender|date=June 12, 1976}}</ref>\n\n''Sparkle'' went on to become a cult-classic among African-American audiences, and [[Sparkle (2012 film)|was remade in 2012]] as a [[TriStar Pictures]] release starring [[Jordin Sparks]] and [[Whitney Houston]]. Directed by Salim and Mara Brock Akil and produced by Stage 6 Films, the film, despite once again receiving mixed to negative reviews, was considered by some to be an improvement over the original.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenman|first1=Howard|title=The Saga of Whitney Houston's Last Movie, 'Sparkle'|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/13/the-saga-of-whitney-houston-s-last-movie-sparkle.html|website=The Daily Beast|date=13 February 2012}}</ref> Sparks, Houston, and [[Mike Epps]] were all praised individually for their performances. The remake also brought new different aspects to the story which were said to have enhanced the drama of the film. For example, the evil Satin, played by Epps, was turned into a comedian instead of a gangster. Ultimately, the writing and performances were considered captivating and multidimensional. In regards to the music, [[R. Kelly]] wrote several new songs which were used alongside the songs composed in the original film by Curtis Mayfield.\n\nThis film was released later than anticipated, due to the sudden death of Houston. Some have considered the film to have been a huge comeback for Houston in the industry, albeit one achieved posthumously. Irene Cara had met Houston a couple of times. She said, \"I remember seeing her mother, Cissy, when I was little, [...] I remember seeing her sing in New York. They were doing a tribute to Burt Bacharach. When Whitney came on to the scene, every time I saw her I saw a little bit of her mother in her.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Susan|title=Irene Cara feels the glow from 'Sparkle'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/19/entertainment/la-et-mn-sparkle-irene-cara-20120820|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|date=19 August 2012}}</ref> Cara expressed a desire to attend the premiere of the film, but was not able due to a recent foot surgery.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Sparkle}}\n*[[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|''Sparkle'' (Aretha Franklin album)]]\n*[[Sparkle (2012 film)|''Sparkle'' (2012 film)]]\n*[[Dreamgirls (film)|''Dreamgirls'' (2006 film)]], another musical that was heavily influenced by [[Diana Ross and the Supremes]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0075249|title=Sparkle}}\n* {{tcmdb title|91005|Sparkle}}\n* {{Amg movie|45943|Sparkle}}\n\n{{Sparkle}}\n{{The Supremes}}\n{{Sam O'Steen}}\n{{Joel Schumacher}}\n\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:Blaxploitation films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:1970s musical films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Harlem]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Joel Schumacher]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1976 film}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Sparkle\n| image = Sparkle-1976film.jpg\n| caption = Theatrical release poster\n| director = [[Sam O'Steen]]\n| writer = {{ubl|[[Joel Schumacher]]|Howard Rosenman}}\n| starring = {{ubl|[[Irene Cara]]|[[Philip Michael Thomas|Philip M.

Hine states that \u201cThe Black Power movement reacted to this reality with an extreme emphasis on masculinity and an expectation that women would assume traditional female roles as a way of supporting black manhood. And yet, women in these organizations actually managed to make greater progress in some ways than they had in more traditional civil rights groups\u201d (298).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Darlene Clark|last2=Thompson|first2=Kathleen|title=A shining thread of hope the history of Black women in America|date=1999|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7679-0111-6|edition=1. paperback}}</ref> The reading also addresses 1976 as a time when things started to change in regards to sexual harassment being a crime. This all relates to black women and their position of power. \u201cThe terrible reality of their oppression by men of their own color [\u2026] was personal and political dynamite\u201d (302). Bringing this all together, Satin might have felt dominated by Sister and her success/potential success. It is unfortunate that Sister decides to brush it off but this goes with how she did not want to \u201clight the fuse\u201d of oppression by black men on black women.\n\n\"Blaxploitation films are notable for the ways they frequently situate \"normative\" black male identity amongst a variety of ideological \"others\" (women, homosexuals, other ethnicities) whose presence cannot simply be seen to solidify black manhood.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wlodarz|first1=Joe|title=Beyond the Black Macho: Queer Blaxploitation|journal=The Velvet Light Trap|date=2004|issue=53|pages=10\u201325}}</ref>\n\n===Black Power / blaxploitation===\nThe 1970s and the Women's Movement provide context for Black films like Sparkle. During this time, [[Title IX]] was instated and provided scholarships for female college athletes. In addition, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] of 1972 was a victory for women's suffrage that helped build a dialogue for black women and black women in films.\n\nDrugs, the Mafia, self-determination, and the ghetto are all apparent themes in Sparkle. \n[[Black Power]] in ''Sparkle'' is interesting in that there are no positive black male figures in the film. Every man is using women for things like sex, success, and their own selfish reasons. At one point, Jones even addresses black male sexuality and how they assume the role of a white man to achieve power over women.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diawara|first1=ed. by Manthia|title=Black American cinema|url=https://archive.org/details/blackamericancin00diaw|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-90397-4}}</ref> Going off of this, whites in this film are on the periphery and the focus is on the inner struggle between blacks. An example of this is the relationship between Sister and her boyfriend. Satin is an abusive man towards Sister who is involved with drugs and the Mafia. He is the source for all of Sisters' struggles as he pushes her into doing drugs and making her feel helpless as he beats her time and time again. Delores is an example of self-determination as she sees her sister Sister struggling, which makes her realize  that she needs to leave town and do things for herself. She is strong and independent enough to pick everything up and leave town, striving for a decent future. \nAccording to the Senior Vice President of Programming for [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] and Bravo, Frances Berwick, \"Blaxploitation films were some of the most experimental and daring films to come out of both the independent film scene and the studio system, [and] is one of the most ignored and under-appreciated.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holsey|first1=Steve|title=The 'blaxploitation' film era: What, if any, were its merits?|issue=46|publisher=Michigan Chronicle|date=August 7, 2002}}</ref> Blaxploitation includes several sub-types, musical being one of them, and where Sparkle fits in.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Sparkle'' was domestically released on April 7, 1976 with a running time of 98 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sparkle (1976) \u2013 Financial Information|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Sparkle-(1976)#tab=summary|website=www.the-numbers.com}}</ref> The film was unsuccessful at the box office grossing merely $4 million against a $1 million production budget.\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics, currently holding a 13% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1019541_sparkle?</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that \"somewhere along the line, there was made a decision to cheat\u2014to attempt an honest ghetto drama, but not enough to really go all the way into the characters; to keep the exploitative elements of casual dope and sex, but jump ahead to the convenient tragic results which can be seen on [[Television film|any TV feature]]; to explore the seedier side of the music business, but not enough to ever get beyond the titillations of pulp storytelling.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Sparkle (Color)|publisher=Variety|date=April 7, 1976}}</ref> Richard Eder said the film was a predictable sob story but that the main themes of the story are serious enough and credible.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eder|first1=Richard|title='Sparkle,' a Sob Story With Its Moments of Force||url=https://archive.org/stream/TheNewYorkTimes1976USAEnglish/Apr%2008%201976%2C%20The%20New%20York%20Times%2C%20%2343174%2C%20USA%20%28en%29#page/n41/mode/2up/search/Sparkle|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 8, 1976}}</ref> [[Dave Kehr]] stated that the film was \"[a] hackneyed, ho-hum 1976 feature about a black girl group, clearly modeled on the Supremes.\" [[FilmFour]] stated that \"[as] drab as it is, ''Sparkle''{{'}}s worth renting for Lonette McKee's performance and the cast renditions of Mayfield's songs. But if you're going to buy anything it should be [[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|the soundtrack album]].\" However, [[The Onion]]'s AV Club gave it a B- grade, calling it \"a rags-to-riches story that doesn't miss a stop along the well-trod ghetto-to-musical-charts path, but makes its journey with tuneful conviction.\"\n\n==Legacy==\nOf the people who appeared in the movie, [[Irene Cara]] became the film's breakout star: she went on to record many chart topping singles. [[Lonette McKee]] went on to other TV and film appearances with [[Richard Pryor]], including playing [[Denzel Washington]]'s on screen mother in ''[[Malcolm X]]'', and [[Dorian Harewood]] and [[Philip Michael Thomas]] did more TV and film appearances. Thomas would be famous as Ricardo Tubbs on the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]''.\n\n''Sparkle'' was previewed by an appreciative audience in Baltimore in March. The crowd of 1300 is said to have applauded, screamed and displayed loud attestation to their feelings that it was a good movie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Sherry|title=Sherry Martin: 'Sparkle' comes to Memphis|issue=22|publisher=Tri - State Defender|date=June 12, 1976}}</ref> It was viewed as a rather atypical Blaxploitation film for the day, illustrating \"that based on the nature, dignity, interests and ideals of man even blacks from the ghetto are capable of self-fulfillment and ehtical conduct without recourse to supernaturalism; in this case the super-stud, super-chick theory that is so common in the movies made primarily for the black movie goers today.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Sherry|title=Sherry Martin: 'Sparkle' comes to Memphis|issue=22|publisher=Tri-State Defender|date=June 12, 1976}}</ref>\n\n''Sparkle'' went on to become a cult-classic among African-American audiences, and [[Sparkle (2012 film)|was remade in 2012]] as a [[TriStar Pictures]] release starring [[Jordin Sparks]] and [[Whitney Houston]]. Directed by Salim and Mara Brock Akil and produced by Stage 6 Films, the film, despite once again receiving mixed to negative reviews, was considered by some to be an improvement over the original.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenman|first1=Howard|title=The Saga of Whitney Houston's Last Movie, 'Sparkle'|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/13/the-saga-of-whitney-houston-s-last-movie-sparkle.html|website=The Daily Beast|date=13 February 2012}}</ref> Sparks, Houston, and [[Mike Epps]] were all praised individually for their performances. The remake also brought new different aspects to the story which were said to have enhanced the drama of the film. For example, the evil Satin, played by Epps, was turned into a comedian instead of a gangster. Ultimately, the writing and performances were considered captivating and multidimensional. In regards to the music, [[R. Kelly]] wrote several new songs which were used alongside the songs composed in the original film by Curtis Mayfield.\n\nThis film was released later than anticipated, due to the sudden death of Houston. Some have considered the film to have been a huge comeback for Houston in the industry, albeit one achieved posthumously. Irene Cara had met Houston a couple of times. She said, \"I remember seeing her mother, Cissy, when I was little, [...] I remember seeing her sing in New York. They were doing a tribute to Burt Bacharach. When Whitney came on to the scene, every time I saw her I saw a little bit of her mother in her.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Susan|title=Irene Cara feels the glow from 'Sparkle'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/19/entertainment/la-et-mn-sparkle-irene-cara-20120820|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|date=19 August 2012}}</ref> Cara expressed a desire to attend the premiere of the film, but was not able due to a recent foot surgery.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Sparkle}}\n*[[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|''Sparkle'' (Aretha Franklin album)]]\n*[[Sparkle (2012 film)|''Sparkle'' (2012 film)]]\n*[[Dreamgirls (film)|''Dreamgirls'' (2006 film)]], another musical that was heavily influenced by [[Diana Ross and the Supremes]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0075249|title=Sparkle}}\n* {{tcmdb title|91005|Sparkle}}\n* {{Amg movie|45943|Sparkle}}\n\n{{Sparkle}}\n{{The Supremes}}\n{{Sam O'Steen}}\n{{Joel Schumacher}}\n\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:Blaxploitation films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:1970s musical films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Harlem]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Joel Schumacher]]\n", "name_user": "Leekil", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGender and sexuality:Fixed the syntax of a couple movie references, and a couple other minor edits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkle_(1976_film)"}
