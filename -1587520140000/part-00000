It occurs from both natural and human-made sources.<ref name=cat>http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightpollution/skyGlow.asp Lighting Resource Centre: \"What is sky glow?\".</ref> Artificial skyglow is caused by the [[over-illumination]] of the sky from large city centres, shopping centres, or stadiums. It consists of light that is either emitted directly upward or reflected from the ground that is then scattered by dust and gas molecules in the atmosphere, producing a luminous background or light dome. These artificial skyglows cause the sky to be 5\u201310 times brighter in urban areas than a naturally dark sky that is unaffected by artificial light. Natural skyglow can come from [[Natural lighting|natural light]] sources, such as the [[sunlight|Sun]], the [[moonlight|Moon]], the [[starlight|stars]], or [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s.\n\nSome communities are becoming aware of this problem and are putting forth efforts to minimize the hazy, orange skyglow. A community in particular is the city of [[Merritt, British Columbia]]. An article published July 8, 2010 states that they are making minor changes to lighting in and around Merritt, such as the installment of down-cast lighting to commercial buildings, as part of their light pollution abatement program.<ref name=\"merrittnews.net\">http://www.merrittnews.net/article/20100708/MERRITT0101/100709954/-1/MERRITT/sky-glow-burning-out Merritt News: \"Sky glow burning out?\" author: Kaleena Loehr</ref> The benefits of this technological change include \"saving energy through better focused lights, preserving the environment by reducing excess light that may affect flora and fauna, reducing crime and increasing safety by more adequately illuminating areas, and reducing health risks.\"<ref name=\"merrittnews.net\"/>\n\n== Scotobiology ==\n{{main|Scotobiology}}\nScotobiology is the study of the role darkness plays in living organisms and shows that interrupting darkness by light pollution creates drastic effects for most organisms; changing their food gathering and feeding habits, their mating and reproduction behavior, migration behaviour (birds and insects) and social behavior.<ref name=\"sampaa.org\">http://www.sampaa.org/publications/conference-proceedings-1991-2000/sampaa-6-proceedings/light-pollution/Bidwell%202010.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Approximately 30% of vertebrates and 60% of invertebrates are nocturnal, meaning that they depend on darkness.

[[Earth Hour]] and [[National Dark-Sky Week]] are two examples of such efforts.\n\nThe [[social movement|movement]] started with professional and amateur [[astronomer]]s alarmed that nocturnal [[skyglow]] from urban areas was blotting out the sight of stars. For example, the world-famous [[Palomar Observatory]] in California is threatened by sky-glow from the nearby city of [[Escondido, California|Escondido]] and local businesses.<ref>[http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/community/lightpollution.html Caltech Astronomy Department]</ref> For similar reasons, astronomers in Arizona helped push the governor there to veto a bill in 2012 which would have lifted a ban on illuminated billboards.<ref>[http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/astronomers-celebrate-veto-of-billboard-bill/article_e5f59f64-3a22-5881-8015-4babce8253b2.html AZ Daily Sun: \"Astronomers celebrate veto of billboard bill\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[Nocturnal]] animals can be harmed by light pollution because they are biologically evolved to be dependent on an environment with a certain number of hours of uninterrupted daytime and nighttime. The [[over-illumination]] of the night sky is affecting these organisms (especially birds). This biological study of darkness is called [[scotobiology]].<ref>http://isebindia.com/05_08/05-01-3.html International society of environmental botanists: \"Scotobiology \u2013 The biology of darkness\"</ref> Light pollution has also been found to affect human circadian rhythms.<ref>http://www.darksky.org/about-ida International Dark Sky Association: About the IDA</ref>\n\nThe dark-sky movement encourages the use of [[Light pollution#Improving lighting fixtures|full-cutoff fixtures]] that cast little or no light upward in public areas and generally to encourage communities to adopt lighting regulations. A 2011 project is to establish \"dark sky oasis\" in suburban areas.<ref>[http://www.universetoday.com/91721/a-refreshing-idea-vote-for-enabling-city-kids-to-see-starry-skies/ Universe Today] IDA Suburban Outreach Sites</ref>\n\n== Dark-sky lighting ==\nDark-sky lighting is a concept very important to the dark-sky movement, as it greatly minimizes light pollution.

Opinions vary on what color the light should be, but most agree on the description of \"warm\", which is considered more yellow or orange/amber than white.\n\n== Skyglow ==\n{{main|Skyglow}}\n[[File:M\u00e9xico City at Night 2005.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Mexico City]] at night, showing skyglow bright enough to read a book outside]]\nSkyglow is the illumination of the [[night sky]] or parts of it, resembling an orange \"[[smog]]\". It occurs from both natural and human-made sources.<ref name=cat>http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightpollution/skyGlow.asp Lighting Resource Centre: \"What is sky glow?\".</ref> Artificial skyglow is caused by the [[over-illumination]] of the sky from large city centres, shopping centres, or stadiums. It consists of light that is either emitted directly upward or reflected from the ground that is then scattered by dust and gas molecules in the atmosphere, producing a luminous background or light dome. These artificial skyglows cause the sky to be 5\u201310 times brighter in urban areas than a naturally dark sky that is unaffected by artificial light. Natural skyglow can come from [[Natural lighting|natural light]] sources, such as the [[sunlight|Sun]], the [[moonlight|Moon]], the [[starlight|stars]], or [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s.\n\nSome communities are becoming aware of this problem and are putting forth efforts to minimize the hazy, orange skyglow. A community in particular is the city of [[Merritt, British Columbia]]. An article published July 8, 2010 states that they are making minor changes to lighting in and around Merritt, such as the installment of down-cast lighting to commercial buildings, as part of their light pollution abatement program.<ref name=\"merrittnews.net\">http://www.merrittnews.net/article/20100708/MERRITT0101/100709954/-1/MERRITT/sky-glow-burning-out Merritt News: \"Sky glow burning out?\" author: Kaleena Loehr</ref>\nThe benefits of this technological change include \"saving energy through better focused lights, preserving the environment by reducing excess light that may affect flora and fauna, reducing crime and increasing safety by more adequately illuminating areas, and reducing health risks.\"<ref name=\"merrittnews.net\"/>\n\n== Scotobiology ==\n{{main|Scotobiology}}\nScotobiology is the study of the role darkness plays in living organisms and shows that interrupting darkness by light pollution creates drastic effects for most organisms; changing their food gathering and feeding habits, their mating and reproduction behavior, migration behaviour (birds and insects) and social behavior.<ref name=\"sampaa.org\">http://www.sampaa.org/publications/conference-proceedings-1991-2000/sampaa-6-proceedings/light-pollution/Bidwell%202010.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Approximately 30% of vertebrates and 60% of invertebrates are nocturnal, meaning that they depend on darkness.

Light during night time hours has been linked to human cancers and psychological disorders.<ref name=\"sampaa.org\"/>\n\n== Dark-sky preserves ==\n{{main|Dark-sky preserve}}\nDark-sky preserves are the main contributors to the dark-sky movement. They are protected areas found mostly in national parks that have a zero light pollution policy set in by the government and controlled by the National Dark Sky Association.\n\nAs of February 6, 2012, there were 35 formally recognized dark-sky preserves in the world with Canada in the lead containing 15 preserves. These preserves are located in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. Other countries that have dark-sky preserves are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. A current list of designated parks is maintained by the Dark Skies Advisory Group <ref>http://www.darkskyparks.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=564 Dark Skies Advisory Group</ref> of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nThe parks are put in place by the Dark Sky Places program with the intention to remind us that the night sky serves just as much importance to our culture and history as our day-time sky.<ref>http://www.darksky.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=564 International Dark Sky Association: \"International Dark Sky Places</ref>\n\n== International Dark-Sky Association ==\n{{main|International Dark-Sky Association}}\nThe International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) began in 1988. A non-profit, it manages the Fixture Seal of Approval program, which offers a third-party rating system judging the \"sky-friendliness\" of lighting fixtures. In 2009, the IDA opened an office for public policy and government affairs in [[Washington, D.C.]] to inform lawmakers and lobbyists about the energy efficiency of outdoor lighting and to promote the adoption of energy-saving measures.<ref>http://www.darksky.org/about-ida International Dark Sky association: \"About the IDA\"</ref> The IDA has implemented several ''simple guidelines'' to responsible outdoor lighting along with some ''practical considerations''.\n\n* In regard to safety, one needs only the right amount of light, in the right place, at the right time. More light often means wasted light and energy.\n* Use the lowest wattage of lamp that is feasible. The maximum wattage for most commercial applications should be 250 watts of high intensity discharge lighting, but less is usually sufficient.\n* Incorporate curfews (i.e., turn lights off automatically after a certain hour when businesses close or traffic is minimal).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darksky.org/outdoorlighting/guidance |title=Simple guidelines |accessdate=2013-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208003935/http://darksky.org/outdoorlighting/guidance |archivedate=2014-02-08 }} International Dark Sky Association: \"Simple guidelines for lighting regulations. retrieved 30 December 2013</ref>\n\n== List of groups ==\n{{Div col}}\n*[http://www.anpcen.fr ANPCEN] (France)\n* [[Astronomitaly]] (Italy)\n*[[Campaign for Dark Skies]] (UK)\n*[[Canadian Geographic]] (Canada)\n*[[Canadian Scotobiology Group]] (Canada)\n*[[CieloBuio]] (Italy)\n*[[International Dark-Sky Association]]\n*[[National Dark-Sky Week]] (United States)\n*[[Niue]]\n*[[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] (Canada)\n{{End div col}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bortle dark-sky scale]]\n*[[SKYGLOW]]\n*[[Dark-sky preserve]]\n*[[Noctcaelador]]\n{{End div col}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.darksky.org/ International Dark-Sky Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718102049/https://www.mydarksky.com/ MyDarkSky \u2013 dark sky survey maps]\n*[http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Cat/0/Number/587221/an/0/page/0#587221/ Outdoor Lighting Regulations and Ordinances on Google Earth]\n*[http://www.lawserver.com/dark-sky-laws Interactive map comparing U.S. dark sky laws]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111028172132/http://buzzlog.yahoo.com/buzzlog/94259 The dark sky movement \u2013 yahoo]\n*[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/apr11/astronomy_jasper_national_park.asp Jasper National Park]\n*[http://www.darkskyparks.org/dsag/DSP%20world%20list_feb2012.pdf Dark-sky parks of the world]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.flagstaffdarkskies.org/ Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition]\n*[https://www.globeatnight.org/ Globe at Night]\n*[http://citiesatnight.org/ Cities at Night]\n*[http://www.darkskiesawareness.org/ Dark Skies Awareness]\n*[http://darkskystudies.org/ The Consortium for Dark Sky Studies]\n\n[[Category:Environmental movements]]\n[[Category:Light pollution]]\n", "name_user": "ChromeGames923", "label": "safe", "comment": "Ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark-sky_movement"}

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order them to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order them to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

Both libraries were originally established by local manufacturing companies, a reflection of Smithfield's industrial past.\n\nEast Smithfield Public Library today  \nThe Bernon Library was founded in the village of Georgiaville in 1872 by the Bernon Manufacturing Company. It closed after about ten years, but was reopened in 1903 through the cooperation of interested citizens and the Manville-Jenckes Company. It eventually moved to the gallery of a former Baptist Church, and in 1919 it moved again to a refurbished grocery store.\n\nThe Esmond Library was established in 1916, when Esmond Mills contributed space and funding for a library. Esmond Mills closed in 1946 due to labor troubles, and the library closed along with it. Numerous books were destroyed when water pipes burst in the abandoned building. The Rhode Island-based conglomerate Textron eventually acquired the building, and after considerable time and effort the Smithfield Recreational Association persuaded Textron to deed the building to the town for recreational purposes. The Smithfield Recreational Association rejuvenated the library, and Elodie Blackmore was appointed librarian in 1954. She catalogued and prepared approximately 2,500 books for circulation. Today, the library's collection totals approximately 70,000 books.\n\nThe East Smithfield Public Library was born in 1967, when the boards of the Bernon and Esmond libraries decided to consolidate. Bernon Library was designated as a reading center, and one librarian managed both buildings. Sadly, in 1973, budget cuts forced the decision to close the Bernon reading center and transfer its collection to the East Smithfield Public Library.\n\nIn 1982, the library was asked to submit a proposal to the Town Council on the feasibility of renovating and utilizing part of the former Dorothy T.P. Dame School as a possible solution to the overcrowding that came as a result of combining both libraries. The Board of Trustees and library staff jumped at the opportunity to secure almost three times more operating space. The Town Council granted the use of the first floor to the library in August 1982, and finally, in 1985, after a tremendous volunteer effort by the entire Smithfield community, the contents of the library were moved to its present location at 50 Esmond Street.\n\nDuring the past 25 years - with help from the [[Champlin Foundations]] and the [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Town of Smithfield]] - the library has renovated the second floor to provide much needed space for a computer area, media room and storage space, conference room, administration offices, and technical services work area. The library continues to thrive and serve the greater Smithfield community with services and resources for all ages.<ref>http://www.eastsmithfieldpubliclibrary.org|Library's{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} website</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Greenville Public Library (Rhode Island)]]\n*[[List of libraries in Rhode Island]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.eastsmithfieldpubliclibrary.org|Library's website}}\n*[http://sites.google.com/site/esmyap Young Adult Page]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Education in Providence County, Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Smithfield, Rhode Island]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox library\n| name               = East Smithfield Public Library \n| logo               = \n| image              = East Smithfield Public Library, Esmond RI.jpg\n| caption            = \n| country            = United States of America\n| type               = Public Library\n| scope              = \n| established        = {{Start date|1869}}\n| ref_legal_mandate  = \n| location           = [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]]\n| coordinates        = {{coord|41.8742|-71.5045|type:landmark_region:US-RI|display=inline,title}}\n| branch_of          = \n| num_branches       = \n| items_collected    = \n| collection_size    = 69,118\n| criteria           = \n| legal_deposit      = \n| req_to_access      = \n| annual_circulation = \n| pop_served         = 20,613\n| director           = Cynthia Mulbach\n| num_employees      = \n| website            = {{URL|www.eastsmithfieldpubliclibrary.com}}\n}}\n\nThe '''East Smithfield Public Library''' is a [[public library]] in the village of [[Esmond, Rhode Island|Esmond]], [[Rhode Island]] in the town of [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Smithfield]].\n\n==Services==\nLibrary services include:\n* Books, audio books, DVDs, CDs, magazines, passes to [[Providence Children's Museum]] and [[Roger Williams Park Zoo]], puzzles, games, and other materials,\n* Online information services and databases, such as Live Homework Help RI, the online [[World Book Encyclopedia]], and a multitude of online  research guides and databases, WorldBook Discover, Ebscohost through [http://ASKRI.org http://www.askri.org/]\n* Download-able audio books and e-books through [http://riezone.lib.overdrive.com/55FFAAF0-11AD-4180-9FB9-55C6F40CC434/10/383/en/Default.htm Ocean State Libraries E-Zone] and Inter-Library Loan\n* Public computers with Internet access, and WiFi\n* Copy Machine, Fax, Laminating, Conference room, and Display cases\n* Programming for children, young adults, and adults including Summer Reading Programs for Teens and Children and Storytimes\n\n==History==\nThe current-day East Smithfield Public Library began as two separate libraries: The Bernon Library and the Esmond Library.

It was also discussed at a local meeting of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|Women's Christian Temperance Union]] on November 4, 1889.\n\nOn March 10, 1890, the twenty-one ladies present pledged to raise $100 to help fund a new library. At the W.C.T.U. meeting on December 7, 1891, Mrs. W. H. Rogers, president of the society, acted as chairman and appointed a committee to petition the city council to ask the voters to appropriate $500 for a free public library.\n\nOn January 4, 1892, the City Fort Atkinson  voted to authorize an expenditure of $500 for library purposes.  However, the city council discovered they could not release the funds because there was no money left in the city treasury. In response, on January 12, 1892, at a W.C.T.U. meeting, a committee was appointed to raise the $500. The W.C.TU. donated $100 and in a few months the $500 was promised on paper. By May 21, 1892, they had raised $80 by putting on cost suppers, $20 by donations and $400 by pledges that they collected. On May 25, 1892. The city agreed to donate the money for equipment and maintenance and the city's public library was officially born.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starke|first=William|title=One Hundred Years of Progress (1890-1990) Dwight Foster Public Library|date=September 1990|url=http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist|access-date=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508172640/http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist|archive-date=2012-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Building history ==\nFort Atkinson's first library was located at 115 South Main Street, at the northeast corner of Main Street and East Milwaukee, on the second floor of the Wigdale building .\n\nOn March 1901, the library committee voted to send a letter requesting a donation to [[Andrew Carnegie]], but no reply was ever received. In 1904, the committee again wrote to Carnegie, asking for $10,000.  His private secretary responded, saying that Carnegie felt the current library facilities were adequate. Thus, Dwight Foster Public Library is not a [[Carnegie library]].\n\nIn 1910, the library board decided to move the library into more spacious quarters in its own building.  In 1910, the city purchased the new property for $3,000. The lot south of the library was purchased in 1911.\n\nIn 1912, Henry E. Southwell gave the city $10,000 for the purchase of a new library building, stipulating that it be named after Dwight Foster, his father-in-law and the founder of Fort Atkinson. In the spring of 1915, the city council appropriated $4,000 toward the erection of the new building and later added an additional $1,100. The Hoard residence, which had housed the library, was moved to a new location on Bluff Street and the new library was built on the old site. The new library was dedicated on October 13, 1916. The total cost was $16,695.23. A clipping from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]] of Sunday, October 1, 1916, commented on the new library. It said that the building was unique in design and that the arrangement was ideal for a small library. \"The building is of cement and hollow tile, Kellastone outside finish of green granite and red tile roof.\"\n\nOn January 27, 1929, a special meeting was called to announce that the daughter of Mr. Henry E. and Mrs. Celeste A. Foster Southwell, Mrs. Mary Worcester, was donating $25,000 to be used as a children's wing with its own entrance so that they would not disturb those doing research. Her only stipulation was that the architect's plans were to be submitted to her first and the new wing was to be called the Celeste A. Foster Southwell Memorial Wing, in honor of her mother. Her generous offer was accepted by the board. The new children's wing was dedicated January 28, 1931. The total value of the library was then estimated at $77,000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starke|first=William|date=September 1990|title=One Hundred Years of Progress (1890-1990) Dwight Foster Public Library|url=http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist2|access-date=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713114833/http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist2|archive-date=2012-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe library operated in this footprint for more than 50 years. In 1981, after years of being overcrowded, the library board did a feasibility study on possibility of expanding. A design that more than doubled the total floor space to 21,000 square feet was approved. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $600,000 and an effort to raise half the funds for the cost of project from private sources was successful. The expansion was completed in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starke|first=William|date=September 1990|title=One Hundred Years of Progress (1890-1990) Dwight Foster Public Library|url=http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist3|access-date=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713114955/http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist3|archive-date=2012-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA third expansion was completed in 2011.

It was also discussed at a local meeting of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|Women's Christian Temperance Union]] on November 4, 1889. \n\nOn March 10, 1890, the twenty-one ladies present pledged to raise $100 to help fund a new library. At the W.C.T.U. meeting on December 7, 1891, Mrs. W. H. Rogers, president of the society, acted as chairman and appointed a committee to petition the city council to ask the voters to appropriate $500 for a free public library.\n\nOn January 4, 1892, the City Fort Atkinson  voted to authorize an expenditure of $500 for library purposes.  However, the city council discovered they could not release the funds because there was no money left in the city treasury. In response, on January 12, 1892, at a W.C.T.U. meeting, a committee was appointed to raise the $500. The W.C.TU. donated $100 and in a few months the $500 was promised on paper. By May 21, 1892, they had raised $80 by putting on cost suppers, $20 by donations and $400 by pledges that they collected. On May 25, 1892. The city agreed to donate the money for equipment and maintenance and the city's public library was officially born.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starke|first=William|title=One Hundred Years of Progress (1890-1990) Dwight Foster Public Library|date=September 1990|url=http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist|access-date=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508172640/http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist|archive-date=2012-05-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Building history ==\nFort Atkinson's first library was located at 115 South Main Street, at the northeast corner of Main Street and East Milwaukee, on the second floor of the Wigdale building .\n\nOn March 1901, the library committee voted to send a letter requesting a donation to [[Andrew Carnegie]], but no reply was ever received. In 1904, the committee again wrote to Carnegie, asking for $10,000.  His private secretary responded, saying that Carnegie felt the current library facilities were adequate. Thus, Dwight Foster Public Library is not a [[Carnegie library]]. \n\nIn 1910, the library board decided to move the library into more spacious quarters in its own building.  In 1910, the city purchased the new property for $3,000. The lot south of the library was purchased in 1911.\n\nIn 1912, Henry E. Southwell gave the city $10,000 for the purchase of a new library building, stipulating that it be named after Dwight Foster, his father-in-law and the founder of Fort Atkinson. In the spring of 1915, the city council appropriated $4,000 toward the erection of the new building and later added an additional $1,100. The Hoard residence, which had housed the library, was moved to a new location on Bluff Street and the new library was built on the old site. The new library was dedicated on October 13, 1916. The total cost was $16,695.23. A clipping from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]] of Sunday, October 1, 1916, commented on the new library. It said that the building was unique in design and that the arrangement was ideal for a small library. \"The building is of cement and hollow tile, Kellastone outside finish of green granite and red tile roof.\"\n\nOn January 27, 1929, a special meeting was called to announce that the daughter of Mr. Henry E. and Mrs. Celeste A. Foster Southwell, Mrs. Mary Worcester, was donating $25,000 to be used as a children's wing with its own entrance so that they would not disturb those doing research. Her only stipulation was that the architect's plans were to be submitted to her first and the new wing was to be called the Celeste A. Foster Southwell Memorial Wing, in honor of her mother. Her generous offer was accepted by the board. The new children's wing was dedicated January 28, 1931. The total value of the library was then estimated at $77,000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starke|first=William|date=September 1990|title=One Hundred Years of Progress (1890-1990) Dwight Foster Public Library|url=http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist2|access-date=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713114833/http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist2|archive-date=2012-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe library operated in this footprint for more than 50 years. In 1981, after years of being overcrowded, the library board did a feasibility study on possibility of expanding. A design that more than doubled the total floor space to 21,000 square feet was approved. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $600,000 and an effort to raise half the funds for the cost of project from private sources was successful. The expansion was completed in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starke|first=William|date=September 1990|title=One Hundred Years of Progress (1890-1990) Dwight Foster Public Library|url=http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist3|access-date=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713114955/http://www.fortlibrary.org/webtemplate.php?linkname=libhist3|archive-date=2012-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA third expansion was completed in 2011.
