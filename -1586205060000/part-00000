In New York, four stations battled in the category: [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA (570&nbsp;AM)]], [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM (1050&nbsp;AM)]], [[WABC (AM)|WABC (770&nbsp;AM)]], and WINS. While WMCA was only 5,000 watts, it was at the bottom end of the dial, which gave it better coverage than might be expected for its power; the other three were all 50,000 watts, but only WABC was both [[omnidirectional antenna|non-directional]] and a [[Clear-channel station|clear channel station]]. Of those three, WINS was the most directional (aimed straight at New York's inner boroughs), with a weaker signal than the others toward the New Jersey suburbs and the [[Jersey Shore]]. \n\nIn 1962, WMGM adopted a [[beautiful music]] format under its previous call letters, WHN, while WINS was purchased by the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]].<ref>\"[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1962/1962-05-07-BC.pdf#page=72 Westinghouse buying WINS]\".

Most other all-news stations later dropped this, but WINS continues to use it to this day despite Teletype machines themselves becoming obsolete by the mid-1980s.  WINS used memorable slogans such as ''\"All news, all the time\"''; ''\"The newswatch never stops\"''; ''\"Listen two, three, four times a day\"''; and ''\"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\"''; the latter tagline was a reference to WINS's format clock, which returns to the top stories every twenty minutes.\n\nWINS's switch to all-news was initially viewed as a risky programming choice.<ref name=\"ToughestTest\" /> [[Tijuana, Mexico]]-based [[border blaster]] [[XEWW-AM|XETRA (690 AM)]] had programmed an English-language all-news format for the [[Los Angeles]] [[media market|radio market]], as had [[Chicago]] station [[WGRB|WNUS]] and, previously [[WAVA-FM|WAVA-AM-FM]] in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area.<ref name=\"ToughestTest\" /> Locally, WABC-FM (now [[WPLJ]]) aired a news format for several weeks during the [[1962\u201363 New York City newspaper strike]].<ref>\"[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1962/1962-12-17-BC.pdf Strikebound N.Y. depends on air news]\".

Despite initial speculation after the merger that either station would drop the all-news format, both stations remained in place and are among the most successful radio operations in the U.S. in terms of advertising sales. The two stations have their own areas of dominance; WINS's ratings numbers are better within New York City, while WCBS's listener strength is greater in the suburbs, owing primarily to its much stronger signal. From a programming standpoint, they have different styles (hard news, vs. lighter and conversational) to appeal to different listeners. Since the Westinghouse-CBS merger, both stations have continued to perform well in both ratings and advertising revenue.\n\nWINS's signal was also improved in 1995 after the company bought KLRA in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], which had also broadcast on the same frequency, and took it off the air.<ref>[http://mighty1090kaay.blogspot.com/2010/09/hollis-duncan-recounts-klra-little-rock.html Hollis Duncan Recounts KLRA, Little Rock, AR History], by Hollis W.

WINS added a secondary affiliation with [[Westwood One News]] on January 1, 2015 after [[Westwood One]] ended a distribution deal with ABC News; WINS does not clear newscasts from either service but does air vocal reports and sound bites.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, [[CBS Radio]] announced it would merge with [[Entercom]], which fully separated WINS and WCBS radio (both AM 880 and FM 101.1) from [[WCBS-TV]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/116299/cbs-radio-to-merge-with-entercom/|title=CBS Radio To Merge With Entercom|date=2017-02-02|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entercom.com/press/entercom-receives-fcc-approval-merger-cbs-radio/|title=Entercom Receives FCC Approval for Merger with CBS Radio|work=Entercom|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/121072/entercom-completes-cbs-radio-merger/|title=Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger|last=Venta|first=Lance|work=Radio Insight|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nCBS was the first broadcaster to make an attempt to mimic Westinghouse's all-news formula.

In the mid-1970s, Westinghouse's second Chicago station, [[WIND (AM)|WIND (560 AM)]], carried the format part-time while competing against CBS-owned, all-news [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]]. WIND was not successful, and Westinghouse tried again after selling WIND in 1985 and acquiring [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ (670 AM)]] from [[NBC]] in 1988.  Westinghouse converted WMAQ (now [[WSCR]]) into a full-time news outlet with mixed results.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, New York would gain a third all-news station, this one on the FM dial, in WEMP's ''FM News 101.9''.  In the wake of meager ratings, the format abruptly flipped back to the [[alternative rock]] format that had been on the frequency three years prior.  Later in 2012, Merlin Media, LLC sold the frequency to CBS Radio, which turned it into an FM simulcast of [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], making it a sister station to both WINS and WCBS.\n\nToday, the New York outlets co-exist with the format as Entercom-owned sister stations. {{As of|2019}}, Entercom operates eight successful all-news stations around the U.S., including WINS, WCBS, WBBM, KNX, KYW, [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] in [[San Francisco]], [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]], and [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]] in [[Dallas]].

Despite initial speculation after the merger that either station would drop the all-news format, both stations remained in place and are among the most successful radio operations in the U.S. in terms of advertising sales. The two stations have their own areas of dominance; WINS's ratings numbers are better within New York City, while WCBS's listener strength is greater in the suburbs, owing primarily to its much stronger signal. From a programming standpoint, they have different styles (hard news, vs. lighter and conversational) to appeal to different listeners. Since the Westinghouse-CBS merger, both stations have continued to perform well in both ratings and advertising revenue.\n\nWINS's signal was also improved in 1995 after the company bought KLRA in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], which had also broadcast on the same frequency, and took it off the air.<ref>[http://mighty1090kaay.blogspot.com/2010/09/hollis-duncan-recounts-klra-little-rock.html Hollis Duncan Recounts KLRA, Little Rock, AR History], by Hollis W.

In the mid-1970s, Westinghouse's second Chicago station, [[WIND (AM)|WIND (560 AM)]], carried the format part-time while competing against CBS-owned, all-news [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]]. WIND was not successful, and Westinghouse tried again after selling WIND in 1985 and acquiring [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ (670 AM)]] from [[NBC]] in 1988.  Westinghouse converted WMAQ (now [[WSCR]]) into a full-time news outlet with mixed results.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, New York would gain a third all-news station, this one on the FM dial, in WEMP's ''FM News 101.9''.  In the wake of meager ratings, the format abruptly flipped back to the [[alternative rock]] format that had been on the frequency three years prior.  Later in 2012, Merlin Media, LLC sold the frequency to CBS Radio, which turned it into an FM simulcast of [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], making it a sister station to both WINS and WCBS.\n\nToday, the New York outlets co-exist with the format as Entercom-owned sister stations. {{As of|2019}}, Entercom operates eight successful all-news stations around the U.S., including WINS, WCBS, WBBM, KNX, KYW, [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] in [[San Francisco]], [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]], and [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]] in [[Dallas]].

The review of complaints had previously usually been coordinated by the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]], with the occasional involvement of local Chief Justices.\n\n=== Landreville case ===\nA key factor that facilitated the creation of the council was the case of justice [[Leo Landreville]]. He was charged with a criminal offence. Those charges were dismissed, but allegations of impropriety continued to be made by some. This gave rise to quite a bit of public debate; some in the legal profession criticized the fact that the judge was still sitting. A Committee of the Law Society, despite not having jurisdiction over a federally appointed judge, produced a negative report without even notifying Landreville of its proceedings.\n\nThere being no defined process to formally inquire into the conduct of a judge, the government then constituted a one-man Royal Commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Ivan Rand. In his report, Rand found some improprieties and was critical of Justice Landreville. However, some said Mr Rand was biased and famous constitutional lawyer J.J. Robinette who represented Justice Landreville before the Commission was seriously critical of the process.\n\nAfter the Rand report became public, a joint Committee of Parliament eventually recommended the judge's removal and he resigned.\n\nThere were many who came to a view that the process which had been followed was flawed: the absence of a process defined in legislation to review the conduct of a judge left too much room for review by the law societies, government or Parliament, of even other bodies without necessarily involving the judiciary.\n\nProfessor William Kaplan, in his book ''Bad Judgment'', wrote that \"Without a doubt, the Landreville case figured prominently in the decision to establish the council.\" He quotes the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice who spoke during second reading of the Bill that created the Council: \"Because the independence of the judiciary is an integral part of the Canadian democratic process, it is important that the judiciary become, to some extent, a self-disciplinary body.\" (Kaplan, p.&nbsp;194)\n\n\"There is no doubt that the awkwardness and uncertainty of the Landreville proceeding was a factor motivating Parliament to adopt this new procedure.\" (Martin Friedland, ''A Place Apart: Judicial Independence and Accountability in Canada'', 1995, p.&nbsp;88).\n\n== Activities ==\nThe CJC's activities have been characterized as seeking to investigate complaints about judicial misbehaviour and on the other hand protecting the reputation of judges against unfounded accusations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Body ===\nThe Council is chaired by the [[Chief Justice of Canada]].

The review of complaints had previously usually been coordinated by the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]], with the occasional involvement of local Chief Justices.\n\n=== Landreville case ===\nA key factor that facilitated the creation of the council was the case of justice [[Leo Landreville]]. He was charged with a criminal offence. Those charges were dismissed, but allegations of impropriety continued to be made by some. This gave rise to quite a bit of public debate; some in the legal profession criticized the fact that the judge was still sitting. A Committee of the Law Society, despite not having jurisdiction over a federally appointed judge, produced a negative report without even notifying Landreville of its proceedings.\n\nThere being no defined process to formally inquire into the conduct of a judge, the government then constituted a one-man Royal Commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Ivan Rand. In his report, Rand found some improprieties and was critical of Justice Landreville. However, some said Mr Rand was biased and famous constitutional lawyer J.J. Robinette who represented Justice Landreville before the Commission was seriously critical of the process.\n\nAfter the Rand report became public, a joint Committee of Parliament eventually recommended the judge's removal and he resigned.\n\nThere were many who came to a view that the process which had been followed was flawed: the absence of a process defined in legislation to review the conduct of a judge left too much room for review by the law societies, government or Parliament, of even other bodies without necessarily involving the judiciary.\n\nProfessor William Kaplan, in his book ''Bad Judgment'', wrote that \"Without a doubt, the Landreville case figured prominently in the decision to establish the council.\" He quotes the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice who spoke during second reading of the Bill that created the Council: \"Because the independence of the judiciary is an integral part of the Canadian democratic process, it is important that the judiciary become, to some extent, a self-disciplinary body.\" (Kaplan, p.&nbsp;194)\n\n\"There is no doubt that the awkwardness and uncertainty of the Landreville proceeding was a factor motivating Parliament to adopt this new procedure.\" (Martin Friedland, ''A Place Apart: Judicial Independence and Accountability in Canada'', 1995, p.&nbsp;88).\n\n== Activities ==\nThe CJC's activities have been characterized as seeking to investigate complaints about judicial misbehaviour and on the other hand protecting the reputation of judges against unfounded accusations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Body ===\nThe Council is chaired by the [[Chief Justice of Canada]].

In the battle, locally raised [[fencibles]], [[Canadian militia|militia]], and Mohawk warriors, repulsed an American assault for Montreal.]]\nDuring the War of 1812, [[Canadian units of the War of 1812|locally raised Canadian units]], including fencibles, and militia units from [[the Canadas]], [[New Brunswick]], Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia served alongside regular units of the British Army. These fencible and militia units played an instrumental role during the conflict. The history and heritage, as well as the War of 1812 battle honours awarded to many of these units, are perpetuated by current units within the Canadian Army.\n\nWhile Canada developed a volunteer [[militia]] force of partially trained and often unpaid amateurs, defence of the country was dependent on a contingent of regular British soldiers, as well as naval defence through the [[Royal Navy]]. The Canadian Militia evolved from the various British garrison forces on the North American continent in the 19th century. In 1854, with the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]], virtually the entire British garrison was pulled out of British North America to fight against Russia, and with many American politicians saying this was the opportune moment for the United State to realize its \"[[manifest destiny]]\" by annexing British North America, the government of the United Canadas, consisting of Canada West (modern Ontario) and Canada East (modern Quebec) passed the [[Militia Act of 1855]] to create an active militia that was essentially a professional army, through not labelled as such.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=79-80}} The \"active militia\" consisted of 5,000 men.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=86}} The Canadian Army is a direct descendant of the \"active duty militia\" force created in 1855. Upon Canadian Confederation in 1867, the ground forces in Canada continued to be referred to as the Militia. Using the \"active duty militia\" of the United Canadas as its core, Parliament passed the Militia Act of 1868 merging the militias of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into the militia of the United Canadas.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=90}} In February 1869, the Defence minister, Sir [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], told the House of Commons that the Militia had 37,170 men under arms and 618, 896 in reserve.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=90}}\n[[File:Funeral of Canadian volunteers killed at Ridgeway in the Fenian Invasion (St. James cemetery, Toronto) Pictures-r-1310.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral for members of the Volunteer Militias killed during the [[Battle of Ridgeway]] at [[St. James Cemetery]], [[Toronto]].]]\nThe primary action that the newly formed militia saw was from the [[Fenian Brotherhood|Fenians]], a group of Irish radicals who made [[Fenian raids|several attempts]] in the late 19th century to invade some parts of southern Canada from the United States.

In 1871, the British garrisons in Canada were almost completely pulled out with British garrisons remaining only in Halifax and Esquimalt.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=79-80}} After 1871, the responsibility for the defence of Canada rested with the Dominion government.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=80}} \n[[File:Royal Military College of Canada cadets train with armstrong field guns c 1885; Stone Frigate.jpg|thumb|Cadets of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] with several [[Armstrong Gun]]s (c. 1885).

Middeleton's successor as the commander of the militia, Colonel [[Ivor Herbert, 1st Baron Treowen|Ivor Herbert]], proved to be a reformer who first revealed to the Canadian press that the ratio of

South Africa.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=115}} Caught between the conflicting pressures in English-Canada and French-Canada, Laurier announced on 14 October that Canada would raise and equip an all-volunteer

Otter.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=115}} At their first battle, the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] the Canadians performed well, and on 27 February 1900 a battalion from the Maritimes end up holding their own ground

to the Canadians, which gave a tremendous boost to Canadian self-confidence.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=116}} In the warm glow of victory, Laurier agreed to send another 1,320 volunteers to South Africa while

connected with the worse offender being Colonel Hughes who regarded himself as above taking orders from anybody.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=117-118}} Lord Dundonald, the British Army officer who commanded the

Dundonald's ideas were generally adopted, but Dundonald's attempts to involve himself in Canadian politics led to his dismissal on 10 June 1904 as the government announced it was intolerable that a serving officer should be speaking on political issues.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=120}}\n\nIn 1904, a new Militia Act was passed to reform the militia by making Canadian officers the equal of British officers and removing the governor-general from exercising command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=119-120}} Laurier had neither forgotten nor forgiven [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]], the Governor-General, for his role in pressuring him to send a force to South Africa in 1899.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=120}} In 1904, Colonel Otter became the first Canadian chief of staff for the militia through a British officer, Colonel Percy Lake, was appointed inspector general of the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=120}} To remedy one of the great defects that had been revealed by the Boer War, [[Eug\u00e8ne Fiset]], a Boer War veteran turned deputy minister of the militia, insisted on improving the medical corps of the militia, saying he had seen too many men die in South Africa because of poor hygiene.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=121}} On 1 July 1905, the last British garrisons were pulled out of Canada and the responsibility for defending the naval bases at Halifax and Esquimalt was assigned to the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=121}} The fact the Royal Military College in Kingston only offered instruction in English and English was the sole language of command ensured that French-Canadians were under-represented in the officer corps as English was generally not taught in Quebec's Catholic schools.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=5}}\n\nSir Samuel Hughes, who became the minister of defence and militia in 1911 after the Conservatives won the general election that year, become the dominating force in Canadian defence policy.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=8}} Hughes was described by the Canadian historian Ren\u00e9 Chartrand as a man of tremendous energy, charisma and a forceful personality who was also a megalomaniac with a grotesquely inflated sense of his own importance and a \"stubborn, pompous racist\" who did little to disguise his anti-Catholic and anti-French views.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=8}} As the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, was afraid of Hughes, the militia minister played an oversized role in defence decision-making.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=8-9}} In 1912, Hughes forbade militia regiments from marching in Catholic processions as they traditionally done in Quebec since 1867, a move that caused much controversy at the time.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}} Through Hughes justified his move under grounds as upholding secularism, Quebec newspapers blamed it on the prejudices of the Orangemen that the militia minister surrounded himself with.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}}\n\nHughes was able to raise the level of military spending from $7 million in 1911 to $11 million in 1914, but little of the money went to the Permanent Force, which Hughes was openly hostile to, praising the militia as embodiment of the authentic fighting spirit of Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=127}} Some of the ways in which Hughes allocated the increased military budget such as giving a free Ford Model T car to every militia colonel in Canada and going on an all expenses junket to Europe in 1913 to observe military maneuvers caused much controversy.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}} Hughes wanted to make militia service compulsory, which he justified under moral, not military grounds, saying in a 1913 speech that he wanted \"To make the youth of Canada self-controlled, erect, decent and patriotic through military and physical training, instead of growing up as under present conditions of no control, into young ruffians or young gadabouts...to make the military camps and drill throughout Canada clean, wholesome, sober and attractive to boys and young men; to give that final tough to imperial unity, and crown the arch of responsible government by an inter-Imperial Parliament dealing only with Imperial affairs\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}} A strong believer in temperance, Hughes also saw militia service as a way of promoting his \"dry\" views, believing he stamp out the evils of alcoholism in Canada by having every man serve in the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}}\n\nBased on his own experiences of the Boer War, Hughes believed that Canadian soldiers were much better soldiers than the British, and it was because of Hughes, the Canadians fought together as a separate expeditionary force in World War I. The staff officers had developed a plan for mobilizing the militia in the event of the war, which Hughes disregarded in August 1914 by creating an entirely new organization called the Canadian Expeditionary Force, which was to consist of numbered battalions that had no connection with the militia regiments.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=9}} Reflecting his own beliefs about the superiority of Canadians over the British as soldiers, Hughes fought hard to ensure that the divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force be commanded by Canadian generals, and very reluctantly accepted British officer, Lieutenant General Edwin Alderson, as the commander of the 1st Canadian Division and only then because of the lack of a qualified Canadian officer.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=137}} Alderson found Hughes a difficult man to deal with as the defence minister insisted on involving himself in matters that were normally the concern of a defence minister and because the Canadian nationalist Hughes insisted on equipping the Canadian Expeditionary Force with Canadian-made equipment as much as possible, regardless of whether it was practical or not.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=137}}\n\n==Expansion and the World Wars (1901\u20131945)==\nAfter Canadian participation in the [[Second Boer War]], the need for domestic supporting organizations was made evident.

October 1916.]]\n{{Main|Military history of Canada during the First World War}}\nCanadian participation in the [[First World War]] began with the unusual step of scrapping all mobilization plans, and creating a field force from scratch.\n\nIn 1914, the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] (CEF) was created in response to a call by the United Kingdom for soldiers.  The CEF was a separate entity from the [[Permanent Active Militia]] (by now also known as the Permanent Force, or PF) and the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]] or NPAM.  Regiments and other units of the Militia were not mobilized, but rather transferred personnel to the CEF for overseas employment. The CEF was disbanded after the war.\n\n===Interwar period modernization===\nThe [[William Dillon Otter|Otter]] Committee reorganized the [[Canadian Militia]] in 1920, instituting a series of perpetuations so that both the pre-war Militia and the CEF had their traditions and histories integrated into the modern Canadian forces. The numbered pre-war regiments were all reorganized and redesignated; the archaic system of numbered regiments in the cavalry and infantry was dropped, with several exceptions such as [[1st Hussars]], the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] (originally the 22nd (Canadien-Fran\u00e7ais) Battalion, CEF), and the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]] (48th Battalion (Highlanders)).\n\nIn 1936, the Non-Permanent Active Militia had six tank battalions created as part of the infantry, the first step towards modernization. Canada's land forces underwent two major organizational changes between the world wars; in 1920 the pre-war regiments were all renamed, several organizational corps were created mirroring corps in the British Army, and new ones like the Canadian Machine Gun Corps or CMGC (not to be confused with the wartime corps of the same name) were created.  The new regiments all perpetuated the history of the wartime CEF, and when [[battle honour]]s were granted many years later, were permitted to adopt those battle honours.\n\nIn 1936, the CMGC was abolished and the Militia again underwent dramatic reorganizations, with three types of infantry regiments being created (rifle, machine gun, and tank).  Many regiments were disbanded or amalgamated.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Military history of Canada during World War II}}\nThe [[Second World War]] saw major changes to the Canadian Militia.

In 1940, the land forces of Canada were retitled. The CASF became the Canadian Army (Overseas), the Permanent Force became the Canadian Army (Active) and the NPAM became the Canadian Army (Reserve). The Canadian Army (Overseas) ceased to exist after the Second World War. A new Canadian Armoured Corps was created and many infantry regiments were reroled to fight in tanks. At home, the [[Atlantic Command (Canadian Army)|Atlantic Command]] and [[Pacific Command (Canadian Army)|Pacific Command]] were created to direct home defence efforts.\n\nA desire to have an entire French-Canadian brigade was thwarted by a lack of francophone staff officers.<ref>See Granatstein, ''The Generals''.</ref> The original mobilization scheme grouped infantry battalions by region; the [[1st Brigade (Canada)|1st Brigade]] was an Ontario brigade, the [[2nd Brigade (Canada)|2nd]] from Western Canada and the [[3rd Brigade (Canada)|3rd]] from the Maritimes. The [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division|2nd Division]] was supposed to follow the same lines, but after deployments to Iceland, the Western Canadian and Quebec brigades were mixed and no attempt was made with the [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd]], [[4th Canadian Division|4th]] or [[5th Canadian Division|5th Division]]s to organize regionally. The [[5th Canadian Infantry Brigade|5th Brigade]] was originally to be an all-Quebec brigade, with one anglophone and two francophone regiments. While French Canada was represented by four overseas French-speaking infantry battalions, and the Canadian Army did attempt to produce training literature in French, it would not be until after Unification that French and English soldiers would have equal career opportunities.\n[[Image:Canadianmortarteam.jpg|thumb|Canadian mortar team in action in France, c. 1944.]]\nThe [[6th Canadian Infantry Division|6th]], [[7th Canadian Infantry Division|7th]] and [[8th Canadian Infantry Division|8th Division]]s were home defence divisions and contained a large number of troops conscripted under the [[National Resources Mobilization Act]] (NRMA) which by law could not serve \"overseas\". One brigade did go to the Aleutians in 1943 to fight the Japanese on the technicality that it was North American soil, though no contact with the enemy was made. In November 1944, on hearing that the [[Government of Canada|government]] had decided to send conscripts overseas, a number of soldiers based in [[Terrace, British Columbia]], [[mutiny|mutinied]]. The [[Terrace Mutiny]] was the largest insurrection in [[Military history of Canada|Canadian military history]].\n\nThe use of irregular forces became common in western Canada during the Second World War, with the [[Pacific Coast Militia Rangers]] being formed in 1942; disbanded after 1945, they were the inspiration for the [[Canadian Rangers]].\n\n==== Veterans Guard of Canada====\nAs with the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the Veterans Guard of Canada was initially formed in the early days of the Second World War as a defence force in case of an attack on Canadian soil. Composed largely of First World War veterans it included, at its peak, 37 Active and Reserve companies with 451 officers and 9,806 other ranks. Over 17,000 veterans served in the force over the course of the war. Active companies served full-time in Canada as well as overseas, including a General Duty Company attached to Canadian Military Headquarters in London, England, No. 33 Coy. in the Bahamas, No. 34 Coy. in British Guiana and Newfoundland, and a smaller group dispatched to India. The Veterans Guard were involved in a three-day prisoner of war uprising in 1942, known as the [[Battle of Bowmanville]]. Along with its home defence role, the Veterans Guard assumed responsibility for guarding internment camps from the Canadian Provost Corps, which helped release younger Canadians for service overseas. The Guards were disbanded in 1947.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/html/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=V&page=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205034/http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/html/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=V&page=1 |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Early Cold War (1946\u20131968)==\nThe Canadian Army underwent many changes after the Second World War, including redesignations. The full-time component became the Canadian Army Active Force and the part-time component the Canadian Army Reserve Force.\n\nBefore 1930 the Canadian Army was a small cadre of professional soldiers augmented by civilian volunteers and, in the Second World War, conscripts.  It was basically a colonial institution that closely followed the traditions, doctrine and training routines of the British Army. After 1945, Canada began breaking loose from Britain in many regards, including the military. At issue was professionalization. The modernizing faction of the Army called for a very well-educated officer corps that was capable of interacting with political and diplomatic elites in Ottawa, and giving the military its own voice in national decisions. However, the traditionalist element emphasized the wisdom and preserving regimental traditions, and said leadership should be based on middle and upper-class status. Invariably, this meant senior officers of British descent, as opposed to French or Irish or other ethnic backgrounds. The tension between modernizers and traditionalists lead to stalemate, and a failure to develop modern management. The modernizers pointed to the failure of professional norms in the 1993 [[Somalia Affair|Somalia peacekeeping fiasco]]. In recent decades, the reformers have developed a \"constabulary-realist\" model of professionalism.<ref>Peter Kasurak, \"Concepts of Professionalism in the Canadian Army, 1946\u20142000: Regimentalism, Reaction, and Reform.\" ''Armed Forces & Society'' 37#1 (2011): 95\u2013118.</ref>\n\n===Korean War===\n{{Main|Canada in the Korean War}}\n[[File:Captain Claxton Ray Lt.

R. Stevens of the Canadian Army during the [[Korean War]].]]\nCanada's military was revitalized as a result of the Korean War. A planned changeover to US-designed weapons equipment had been planned for the 1950s, but the emergency in Korea forced the use of war stocks of Second World War\u2013vintage British-designed weapons. On 5 February 1951, at a time when the Chinese were advancing in Korea, the Defence Minister, Brooke Claxton, announced in the House of Commons an emergency military budget of $5 billion which committed the government to raise an infantry division within the next three years and committed a brigade to Europe at once.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} At the time, it was believed that Stalin had ordered the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950 as a part of an diversion to tie down Western forces in Korea as a prelude to a Soviet invasion of West Germany.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=236}} Consequently, Canada followed the United States in increasing forces for the defence of West Germany instead of South Korea during the Korean War.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=236}} On 16 January 1951, General Dwight Eisenhower, the NATO Supreme Allied Commander, visited Ottawa to tell the Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and his cabinet that he believed there was a possibility the Red Army would invade West Germany in the near-future and help from Canada was needed at once.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=236}}\n\nUltimately, Canada promised two divisions to the defence of West Germany.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} A major dispute arose between General Charles Foulkes, chief of the defence staff and General Guy Simomds, chief of the army staff over whatever the Canadian contingent would serve under U.S or British command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} Foulkes had served under Simonds in World War Two, and the two generals were well known for their acrimonious relations as Simonds always took the view that Foulkes was incompetent.  Simonds successfully argued that for historical reasons and because of doubts about the combat efficiency of the U.S Army that the Canadians should serve as part of the British Army of the Rhine in northern Germany.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} The way in which the North Koreans had driven the Americans back to the Pusan perimeter in the summer of 1950 followed by the Chinese victory along the Yalu in November 1950 had \"shocked\" Canadian decision-makers and created major doubts about the quality of the U.S. Army.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}}  In the late 1950s, Canada adopted a variety of weapons of [[Europe]]an, British and US design rather than proceeding with its planned Americanization.\n\n===Post-Korea===\nAside from providing a field force for the Korean War, few operational missions existed until the rise of [[peacekeeping]] in the 1960s.\n\nPrior to the [[Coronation of the British Monarch|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], the Canadian Army was the only [[British Empire|Imperial]]/[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation to have provided the [[King's Guard]] in [[London]]. In the lead up, the contingent of Canadian troops sent for the coronation provided the guard during June 1953, along with an equivalent unit of the [[Australian Army]].\n\nDuring the early 1950s the Army advertised in British newspapers for British ex-servicemen to join the Canadian Army. These recruits were transported to Canada for training. After a 6-month trial period the soldiers' families were allowed to emigrate to join the father. Transport was usually by scheduled sea transport. In 1954, the report of the Kennedy Board was tabled, giving suggestions for reorganizing the Militia. The Anderson Report followed in late 1957.\n[[File:Guy Simonds e010778918-v8.jpg|thumb|LGen. [[Guy Simonds]], was Canada's [[Commander of the Canadian Army|Chief of Army Staff]] from 1951 to 1955. Simond's vision during his tenure resulted in Canada fielding its largest ever standing army by the late-1950s.]]\nThe late 1950s saw a dramatic increase in the Army's size and Canada's largest ever standing army was created, largely through the vision of General G. G. Simonds, the [[Commander of the Canadian Army|Chief of the General Staff]]. The reason for this expansion was the need to maintain a presence in Germany as part of NATO, while simultaneously providing forces for the Korean War. Simonds stated that the shipping to transport large armies to Europe was not available, any Canadian soldiers wanting to fight in World War Three in Europe should it begin best be there when the war began.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} From 1950 to 1953, the Canadian military ballooned from having 47,000 personnel to 104,000 personnel by 1953.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}} Despite the increasing size, General Guy Simonds complained that the Army was not attracting enough men with the necessary specialized skills and spoke of peacetime conscription, only to be silenced by the Defence minister Brooke Claxton, who warned him that with public opinion polls showing that 83% of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois opposed to conscription, that this was too politically risky.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}}  Initially, six new regular infantry battalions were raised by regiments of the Militia \u2013 two were raised from ordinary line infantry regiments, two from regiments of rifles and two from regiments of Highlanders. When the decision was made to make this arrangement permanent, it was decided that the battalions would become regular battalions of regiments. The decision was taken to make the rifles and highland battalions part of two of the senior existing militia regiments, while the infantry battalions were organised into a new national regiment:\n*1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Battalions \u2013 3rd and 4th Battalions, [[Canadian Guards]] (Raised by the [[Carleton and York Regiment]], the [[Algonquin Regiment]], the [[Loyal Edmonton Regiment]], les [[Fusiliers Mont-Royal]] and the [[Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]].)\n*1st and 2nd Canadian Rifle Battalions \u2013 1st and 2nd Battalions, [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]] (Raised by the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, the [[Victoria Rifles of Canada]], the [[Royal Winnipeg Rifles]], the [[Regina Rifle Regiment]] and the [[Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment)]].)\n*1st and 2nd Canadian Highland Battalions \u2013 1st and 2nd Battalions, [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] (Raised by the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, the [[North Nova Scotia Highlanders]], [[48th Highlanders of Canada]], the [[Seaforth Highlanders of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's)]].)\n\nSimonds was a great believer in ''esprit de corps'' as a way of motivating soldiers to fight, and he quite consciously sought to build on the history and traditions of the Canadian Army to provide men serving in the Army with a reason to feel pride in their regiments, and hence a willingness to fight for their regimental honor.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}} It was for this reason that Simonds had militia regiments like the Black Watch of Montreal, the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto and the Fort Garry Horse of Winnipeg transferred over to the regular army instead of raising new regiments, and created a Regiment of Canadian Guards who were closely modeled after the [[Brigade of Guards]] who protected the royal family in London, right down to the scarlet uniforms and bearskin hats.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}} By 1953, the defence budget was $1, 907 million dollars, ten times the level of 1947, and the end of the Korean War did not mark the end of the high level of military spending as the end of the Boer War and the two world wars had done, making the 1950s\u201360s the only period why the Canadian government ever spent large sums on defence in peacetime.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238-239}} The 1950s and 1960s are remembered as something of a \"golden age\" for the military as for once the chronic problems caused by under-funding by Ottawa in peacetime did not exist.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238-239}} Unlike the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force, whose personnel were overwhelmingly English-Canadians and where English was the sole language of command, the Canadian Army was the only service that made some allowance for French-Canadians.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=239}} In 1952, the Army opened the Coll\u00e8ge Militaire Royal de Saint-Jean to train French-Canadian officer candidates in French (previously all officer candidates had been trained in English at the Royal Military College).{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=239}} However, the Canadian Army was still a mostly English-speaking institution in the 1950s with the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment and the 8th Hussars being the only regiments in the regular army that were for French-Canadians.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=239}}\n\nIn the early 1950s Canada sent a brigade to [[West Germany]] as part of its [[NATO]] commitment after the creation of that alliance in 1949. The [[27th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] later became [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]], which remained stationed in West Germany and later the unified Germany until the 1990s and the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe future of the Army was put in doubt in the age of nuclear deterrence. The postwar Militia (the part-time component of the Canadian Army) was reroled from combat operations to civil defence. In 1964 the Suttie Commission made suggestions on improving the Army. In 1968, [[The Canadian Airborne Regiment]], a full-time parachute regiment, was created.\n\n===Unification===\n{{Main|Unification of the Canadian Forces}}\n[[File:Paul Hellyer-c1969.jpg|thumb|As the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], [[Paul Hellyer]] issued [[white paper]]s in 1964 that proposed uniting the Air Force, Army, and Navy into a single service.]]\n[[Paul Hellyer]], the Liberal Defence Minister, had issued a white paper in 1964 proposing to unite the Army, the Air Force and the Navy into one service, arguing that the idea of separate services fighting on land, sea and the air were anachronistic in the modern age.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=250-252}} Hellyer's plans to unify the military provoked much opposition; an essay by General Simonds called Hellyer's ideas nonsense.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} Simonds wrote an Air Force pilot alone in his aircraft decided whatever to fight or flee; a junior naval officer holding the equivalent rank as the air force pilot had the decision to fight decided by his captain for him; and a junior Army officer holding the equivalent rank as the naval and air force officers had to decide not only to fight or flee for himself, but to persuade the men under his command to fight as well.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} General Simonds argued the different environments of war at land, air, and sea required different leadership styles and Hellyer's plans to merge all three services into one threatened to dissolve what was necessary for officers in each service.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} Hellyer's Chief of the Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal [[Frank Robert Miller]], resigned in protest against unification, as did two generals who resigned in 1964 and seven admirals in 1966.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}}\n\nAfter Air Marshal Miller resigned, Hellyer appointed General [[Jean Victor Allard]] as Chief of the Defence Staff, who supported unification as a way of promoting the \"French fact\" in the military.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} General Allard, who had served with the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment in Italy in World War II and in Korea, had a distinguished combat record, but also described by the historian Desmond Morton as a \"chronic opportunist\" who was forever seeking a way to ingratitude himself with those who held power.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} Furthermore, the French-Canadian Allard believed the military was too British and felt that unification and \"Canadianizing\" the military would encourage more French-Canadians to enlist.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} The resignations of the officers failed to move public opinion with most Canadians being apathetic about Hellyer's plans for unification.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} Newspaper cartoonists frequently ridiculed the officers who resigned as an absurd Colonel Blimp types who were anachronistically clinging to British traditions and old-fashioned ideas about war in the modern age while Hellyer was depicted as a bold visionary and a technocratic elitist whose plans to merge the three services into one were in tune with the ''zeitgeist''.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} An ambitious man, Hellyer had championed unification to present himself as an innovative leader as he openly aspired to be prime minister one day, and in general the media took his side against his military critics.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=251-252}} In a 1966 editorial, the ''Winnipeg Free Press'' stated that Hellyer had \"earned the nation's gratitude and its continued support\" while in the same year the ''Vancouver Sun'' in an editorial declared that \"young Mr. Hellyer seems to be quietly pulling off what may in time be recorded as this government's greatest achievement\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=251-252}}\n\nIn the face of much opposition from the Conservative MPs and with the use of closure, Parliament passed Hellyer's Canadian Forces Reorganization Bill on 25 April 1967.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}}  On 1 July 1967 to mark the Centennial of Canadian confederation, a huge Centennial tattoo was held in Ottawa with all three services marching together to celebrate both Centennial and \"their vanishing traditions\" with many participating noting that this was the end of their services.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}}  The Army was integrated with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] on February 1, 1968, under the policy of [[Unification of the Canadian Forces|Unification]]. The newly formed [[Canadian Forces]] was the first combined military force in the modern world. The Army became known as Force Mobile Command. Helicopter operations, briefly instituted under Army purview in the early 1960s, transferred to [[Canadian Forces Air Command|Air Command]].\n\nMost of the pre-unification corps that had been created in the early 20th century were disbanded; they were merged with counterparts in the Navy and Air Force to form the [[personnel branch]]es of the CF. The move toward unification, as well as other budget and cost-cutting moves during the 1980s and 1990s were vehemently opposed by many and is sometimes regarded as a fault in the Canadian Forces. The majority of veterans and those serving at the time objected to this initiative; with many, including senior officers, leaving the military altogether. One of the most controversial aspects of unification was Hellyer's decision to abolish the traditional British style uniforms of the Canadian Army together with those of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force to impose a common green American style uniform on the entire Canadian Forces.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}}  As part of his drive to \"Canadianize\" the military, Hellyer also abolished the traditional British style ranks and replaced them with American style ranks.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} On 16 August 2011, the Canadian Government restored the names of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force to the existing maritime, land and air commands; although the unified command and structure of the CF remains.\n\n*[[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]] and [[Royal Canadian Dental Corps]]\u2014became the [[Canadian Forces Medical Service]] and Canadian Forces Dental Service respectively; in the 1990s, both the CFMS and CFDS combined together administratively as the '''Canadian Forces Health Services''' (though both still wear their individual branch insignia)\n*[[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals]]\u2014became the [[Communications and Electronics Branch]]. In 2013 the army component of the branch regained the title Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.\n*[[Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps]] amalgamated with supply and transport services of [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps]]\u2014became the Logistics Branch. Renamed in 2018 to [[Royal Canadian Logistics Service]]\n*[[Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]]\u2014became Land Ordnance Engineering, then [[Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Branch]], then back to Corps of Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 2013\n*Clerical trades of Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, [[Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps]], and [[Royal Canadian Postal Corps]]\u2014became the Administration Branch (later merged with the Logistics Branch, and as of 2018 is the Royal Canadian Logistics Service.)\n*[[Canadian Provost Corps]] and [[Canadian Intelligence Corps]]\u2014became the [[Canadian Forces Military Police|Security Branch]]. Both elements split apart in 1982 to the Security Branch and [[Intelligence Branch]]. In 2017, Army Intelligence Officers and Operators of the Intelligence Branch once more became members of the Canadian Intelligence Corps, which remains a part of the overall Intelligence Branch.\n\n==Post-unification and the late-Cold War (1969\u20131991)==\n{{See also|Structure of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1989#Mobile Command}}\nIn 1968, the new Liberal Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau promised a re-evaluation of Canada's defence commitments and for a time in 1968\u201369 seriously considered pulling out of NATO.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=254-255}} Ultimately, Trudeau chose to stay in NATO in order to maintain good relations with the United States and the western European states, all of whom would object if Canada were to leave NATO. On 3 April 1969, Trudeau announced in a speech the new priorities of the Canadian Forces in this order:\n*The \"surveillance\" of Canada to provide protection against external and internal threats as the number one mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \n*Working in co-operation with the United States in the defence of North America as the number two mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \n*The defence of western Europe as per Canada's NATO commitments as the number three mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \n*United Nations peace-keeping missions as the number four mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \nIn May 1969, the Defence Minister, [[L\u00e9o Cadieux]], visited the capitals of western Europe to tell the leaders of the western European states that Canada would be drastically cutting its NATO commitments later that year, and henceforward, Canada's role in NATO would be only to provide token contributions to the defence of western Europe.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} On 23 June 1969, Cadieux announced to the House of Commons drastic cuts in defence spending as Canada's  commitments to NATO were going to be reduced.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} In June 1969 in a speech to the graduating class at Queen's University, Trudeau warned that United States was descending into anarchy with race riots and student protests, and the violence in the United States could \"easily spill\" into Canada, which he claimed required more soldiers in Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=256}} In September 1969, it was announced that half of the Canadian Forces stationed in West Germany were to be pulled out with the remainder to be moved to Lahr in southern West Germany to operate under American operational command; previously, the Canadian Forces in West Germany had been stationed in northern West Germany under British operational command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} The historical links between the British and Canadian armies ended in 1969.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} The major operation for the Canadian Forces in 1969 was domestic when the ''Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al'' went on strike on 7 October 1969, leading to [[Murray-Hill riot|rioting]] in Montreal that required the Army to put down.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=256}} In 1970 Cadieux's successor as Defence Minister, [[Donald Stovel Macdonald|Donald Macdonald]], announced to the House of Commons that the safeguarding Canada's sovereignty and helping with \"the social and economic development of Canada\" were the main purpose of the Canadian Forces.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} In a 1970 white paper, ''Defence in the Seventies'', it was announced the \"Priority One\" of the Canadian Forces was now internal security, with the future enemy now envisioned as the FLQ instead of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=256}}\n\nThe Regular Force was downsized in 1970, and the number of regular infantry battalions was reduced from 13 to 10. This was achieved by reducing the [[Canadian Guards]] to nil strength, returning both the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada to their militia only status and rebadging soldiers into three new battalions of the remaining Regular Regiments. The Regular Force regiment of [[The Fort Garry Horse]] and the 4th Regiment [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]] were reduced to nil strength and placed on the Supplementary Order of battle on 16 June 1970.<ref>Canadian Forces Publication A-DH-267-003/AF-001 \u2013 Part One: Armour, Artillery and Field Engineer Regiments</ref>\n\nIn October 1970, during the [[October Crisis]], the army was called out as an aid to civil power with the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment being deployed to guard government buildings in Montreal on 15 October 1970.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=257}}  The deployment was not popular with the senior leaders of the Canadian Forces, who feared correctly that Trudeau would use the October Crisis as a reason for his \"Priority One\" of internal security.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=257}} In keeping with Trudeau's \"Priority One\" of internal security as the prime mission of the Canadian Forces, throughout the 1970s the Canadian Forces were described as having \"stagnated\", with budget cuts reducing both the size of the Canadian Forces and the amount of equipment available for operations.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=259-261}}  In 1976, as a favour to his close personal friend, West German chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]], and to improve trade talks with the European Economic Community, the Trudeau government purchased 128 German Leopard tanks for Mobile Command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=260}} The Leopard tanks were already outclassed by Red Army [[T-72]]s and would have served little purpose in the event of World War Three, but were felt to be useful for \"Priority One\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=260-262}} Likewise, 400 Swiss-built armoired vehicles were purchased and stationed at various bases and armouries across the country that were meant for the \"Priority One\" of putting down riots, not war, through their purpose was described only as \"peacekeeping\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=262}} Reflecting the \"Priority One\" of internal security, by the end of the 1970s the Mobile Command had become an internal security force that was not capable of fighting a major conventional war.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=261-262}}\n\nMorton wrote the \"drastic 1969 force reduction\" caused the combat efficiency of the Canadian Forces to \"dwindle\" in the 1970s.<ref name=\"auto\">Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', p.261.</ref> The frequent rotation of defence ministers with 7 men holding the portfolio between 1971\u201379 meant there were no defence ministers who ever really understood their portfolio, which led to much confusion and a lack of direction from the top.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Moreover, the Department of National Defence was considered to be unglamorous portfolio that the more abler ministers in the Trudeau cabinet wanted to avoid, and Morton wrote all of the defence ministers of the 1970s were mediocrities.<ref>Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', p.261</ref> Trudeau had little time for his generals, and starting in 1972 began a programme of \"civilization\", bringing civil servants and \"management experts\" to push aside the senior officers at the Department of National Defence in attempt to \"rationalize\" military

procurement in the 1970s.<ref>Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', pp.259\u2013261.</ref>\n\n===Francophone units===\nIn 1967, the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] in its report to Ottawa slammed the Canadian military for mostly operating in English and demanded that more be done to open career opportunities for French-Canadians.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} The Royal Commission criticized the Army for trapping French-Canadians within the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment and a few other units based in Quebec, stating that those French-Canadians who wanted to advance into high command had to serve in what Morton called \"unfamiliar and sometimes inhospitable surroundings outside Quebec\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Because the Army outside of the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment was not seen as friendly towards French-Canadians, very few French-Canadians enlisted and French-Canadian personnel in the Army did not reflect their percentage of the total population of Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Specifically, the royal commission demanded that more French-Canadian units be established outside of Quebec, that all officers holding high command be fluently bilingual and stated that 28% of recruits should be French-Canadian.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} All of the royal commission's recommendations were passed into law, and one consequence of the rule that those holding high command should be bilingual was to give French-Canadian officers something of a monopoly on high command for a generation as most French-Canadian officers were fluent in English while most English-Canadian officers were not fluent in French.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258-259}}\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Canadian Forces committed itself to creating French Language Units (FLUs) and encouraging career opportunities for Francophones. The Minister of National Defence, L\u00e9o Cadieux, announced their creation on April 2, 1968, to include artillery and armoured regiments as well as units of the supporting arms, with two battalions of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] at their core.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} The Army FLUs eventually concentrated at Valcartier and became known as 5<sup>e</sup> Groupement de combat. A French-speaking Regular Force armoured regiment, [[12e R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada|12<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada]], and artillery regiment, [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery|5<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment d'artillerie l\u00e9g\u00e8re du Canada]], were created, and the policy of bilingualism was supported by the first [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], General J.V. Allard. To improve bilingualism, a \"Francotrain\" programme was established to teach English-Canadian officers French and to train French-Canadian recruits in specialist skills.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Morton wrote that: \"From being a virtual anglophone monopoly, the Canadian armed forces came, for a time, to resemble the county they served: two mutually resentful solitudes. Despite Cadieux's hopeful promise that he would not \"divide the force on an unilingual or geographical basis,\" he had done so\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Ultimately, Morton wrote \"enforced bilingualism was necessary. It was also a success\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=259}} By the 1990s, the journalist [[Jocelyn Coulon]] in his books and essays called the Canadian Forces one of the most successful examples of a truly bilingual institution in Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=259}}\n[[File:Canadian AVGPs.jpg|thumb|A pair of Canadian Army [[AVGP|AVGP Cougar]]s during RENDEZVOUS '83, a [[NATO]] exercise in 1983.

Equipment acquisitions such as the M113 APC and Leopard tank marked a modernization, as did the use of the Cougar and Grizzly AVGP in armoured reconnaissance and mechanized infantry roles.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1984, the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney government won the general election. The Conservative platform promised to undo the neglect of the Trudeau years, but in office the Mulroney government was torn between increasing the military budget; patronage politics which committed the government to rewarding supporters with contracts, which often had no military justification;and a desire to balance the budget.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265}} Morton commented that Mulroney continued the Trudeau tradition of frequent rotation of defence ministers together with \"handing the defence portfolio to weak or worn out ministers\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265}}\n\nIn 1985, the Mulroney government restored the different uniforms of the Canadian Forces with the Mobile Command being allowed to wear tan brown uniforms to distinguish them from the Maritime Command and Air Command in a move that was widely welcomed by the rank and file.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265-267}} After Mulroney's first defence minister, [[Robert Coates (politician)|Robert Coates]], was forced to resign after it was revealed that he spent much of a trip to West Germany visiting strip clubs, he was replaced by [[Erik Nielsen]], a Second World War veteran and a \"tough political insider with plenty of experience\" who also served as deputy prime minister.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265-267}} Neilson was an articulate advocate for the Canadian Forces within the cabinet and was able to increase the military budget with the Canadian brigade in West Germany that had been under-strength ever since 1969 finally brought up to full strength.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=266}} In 1985, the United States sent an icebreaker through the Northwest Passage without Canadian permission, which first awakened interests in  Ottawa about the need to safeguard Canada's claims to Arctic sovereignty{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}}  A wargame was held in 1986 where the [[Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group]] (CAST) was ordered to Norway.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}} The CAST operation was a fiasco and showed Canada could not move a military force to Norway, and by implication the Arctic, with the necessary speed.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}}\n\nIn 1987, the new Defence Minister, [[Perrin Beatty]], brought in a white paper, ''Challenge and Commitment'', proposing a major increase in the military budget with the Army to field three divisions, two for NATO in central Europe, and another for the defence of Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}} The white paper also promised to buy a dozen nuclear submarines for the defence of Arctic sovereignty, and this aspect of the white paper generated so much opposition, both at home and in the United States, that nothing came of it.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=268}} The end of the Cold War in 1989\u201390 also marked the beginning of a new era of military cuts.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=268-269}} In 1989, Beatty was replaced as defence minister with Saskatchewan politician [[Bill McKnight]].{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=268}}\n\nAt the very end of the Cold War and the years just after, the Canadian Land Forces began emphasizing a concept of the \"Total Force\" in which greater integration between Regular Force and Reserve Force components was to be achieved, starting in 1987. Unsuccessful experiments during this period included \"10/90 battalions\" which were intended to be ten percent Regular Force and ninety percent reserve force. After a few years, these organizations were all undone.\n\nOther successful and lasting changes included reorganizing regional component headquarters into larger Total Force headquarters. Force Mobile Command became simply Mobile Command in 1990\u201391.<ref>Godefroy, Chasing the Silver Bullet.</ref> In September 1991, the five regional Militia Areas were reorganized into four Land Force Areas, and the Regular Force establishments were integrated into this chain of command based on geographic location.<ref name=\"Domestic Military Organization 1900-1999\">{{Cite web|title=Domestic Military Organization 1900\u20131999|publisher=Canadian Soldiers.com|date=22 February 2013|url=http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/organization/districts.htm}}</ref>\n\n==New challenges in the post-Cold War era (1990\u2013present)==\nIt was widely expected the end of the Cold War would see major defence cuts. However, the end of the Meech Lake Accord on 23 June 1990 caused a major surge of support for Quebec separatism with public opinion polls showing that 60% of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois supporting separatism in the aftermath of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} For a time in 1990, Canada appeared to be on the brink of dissolution with many openly wondering when Quebec would leave Confederation.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}}  In this context, the military was seen as the last line to prevent a possible civil war between English-Canadians and French-Canadians. Contributing to the sense of crisis in 1990 and the feeling that Canada was falling apart was the [[Oka Crisis]].\n\nThe Oka crisis began on 11 July 1990 with a shoot-out in Oka between the Mohawk Warrior Society and the ''S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec'' that left one police officer killed.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} In the face of the stand-off with the armed Warrior Society holding land that they claimed belonged to the Mohawk people in Oka and the Mercier bridge linking Montreal to the mainland being occupied by the Mohawk Warrior Society, the Quebec Premier [[Robert Bourassa]] asked for the Army to intervene to maintain \"public safety\" on 17 August 1990.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} Mulroney gave his approval, and the Chief of the Defence Staff, General [[John de Chastelain]], ordered the [[5e Groupe Brigade Mecanisee du Canada]] from their base at Valcartier to Oka and Montreal.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} On 26 August 1990, the soldiers removed with the use of force, but no bloodshed, the Mohawk Warriors who were occupying one end of the Mercier bridge.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}}  After a month of stand-off at Oka, where the soldiers endured much verbal abuse, the Mohawk Warriors abandoned the confrontation and engaged in a melee with the soldiers on 26 September 1990.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}}\n\nThe performance of the French-Canadian soldiers of the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment during the Oka crisis won the Army unusual praise in generally anti-militarist Quebec, with many Canadians being surprised watching on their TVs at the discipline of the Army in the face of much provocation.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=277}} One consequence of the crises of 1990 was the post-Cold War cuts were not as drastic as expected with the defence minister [[Marcel Masse]] announcing in September 1991 that the Canadian Forces would close their bases in Germany by 1995 and the military were to lose only 10% of their personnel.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=277-288}} In fact, the Canadian bases in Germany at Lahr and Baden-Soellingen were closed on 30 July 1993, two years ahead of schedule, and Canadian Forces Europe was abolished.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=277}}\n\nMobile Command took part in several international missions following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. Aside from playing a minor part in the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Canadian Forces were heavily committed to several UN and NATO missions in the former Yugoslavia which tested the shrinking military's abilities and resources.\n[[File:Canadian Military in Somalia 1992.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers during [[Operation Deliverance]]. While most of the objectives were achieved, the [[Somalia Affair]] was a controversial scandal for the Army, after two soldiers beat a Somali teenager to death.]]\nIn 1995, the [[Canadian Airborne Regiment]] was disbanded after the [[Somalia Affair|Somalia affair]]. Aside from the disbandment of Canada's Airborne Regiment (which did not end parachute capability in the CF, as qualified jumpers were simply reorganized into jump companies of the 3 remaining Regular Force regiments), Somalia had other institutional effects on the military. Chief among these was sensitivity training such as LDA (Leadership in a Diverse Army) and SHARP (Standard for Harassment and Racism Prevention) which became mandatory for all members of the Canadian Forces. The training was a reaction to so-called \"hazing videos\" of members of the Airborne that came to light after the murder in Somalia.\n\nA number of other decisions unrelated to Somalia also reflected changing social values in Canadian society and the Army during the 1990s. Women in Highland regiments were permitted to wear the kilt beginning in the 1990s; a form of dress traditionally gender related. Aboriginals were permitted by regulation to grow long hair in traditional braids, and the turban was accepted as a form of headdress for Sikhs.<ref>The Calgary Highlanders first put females into the kilt for the Queen's Parade on 30 June 1990, and the junior Colour bearer, Lieutenant Harry Sekhon, wore his turban on parade.

In 1998, Force Mobile Command was renamed [[Land Force Command (Canada)|Land Force Command]]. On 15 August 2011, Land Force Command was renamed to the Canadian Army.\n[[File:GuardKandahar.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]] in the [[Kandahar Province]] of [[Afghanistan]].]]\n[[Joint Task Force 2]] was created in the wake of a decision to move counter-terrorism duties from the RCMP to the Canadian Forces.

In 2006, a new [[Canadian Special Operations Regiment]] was created as part of the major reorganization of the CF by [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] General [[Rick Hillier]]. Special operation units fall under [[Canadian Special Operations Command]].\n\n==Integration of women==\nThe Canadian Women's Army Corps was created in the Second World War as a separate corps of the Army, and remained so until the 1960s when women were integrated into the [[Canadian Forces]]. Women were restricted to certain trades, though by the 1990s were accepted into all trades. Captain [[Nichola Goddard]] was the first female combat soldier killed when she died in battle in [[Afghanistan]] in 2006.\n\nThe first 'lady cadets' graduated from [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in the 1980s.\n\n== Canadian Army flags ==\nTo help distinguish its soldiers from British forces, the flag of the Canadian Active Service Force, also known as the Battle Flag of Canada, was approved for use on December 7, 1939, as the Army's command flag. The flag was designed by Colonel A. Fortescue Duguid, Director of the Historical Section at National Defence Headquarters. The battle flag was not popular, and its use was discontinued on January 22, 1944. After the Second World War, the Canadian Army did not have its own distinctive command flag or Ensign, but simply used the Canadian National Flag as a service flag when required.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=flags-flown-by-the-canadian-army/hnps1va0 | title=Flags flown by the Canadian Army | publisher=Canadian Armed Forces / Department of National Defence | date=7 November 2013 | accessdate=24 May 2014 | author=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada}}</ref> In 1989, Force Mobile Command requested and received a command flag, which was designed in the standard command flag pattern, with the Canadian flag in the canton, and the badge in the fly.\n\nThe Union Jack was also used as the Army's service flag  (flown at various army installations) along with the Red Ensign until 1965, after which the current Canadian Flag was exclusively used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatDefence.html|title=Flags of National Defence|website=www.fraser.cc}}</ref>\n\n===Service flags===\n{|\n|[[Image:Canadian Red Ensign 1921-1957.svg|thumb|150px|The Red Ensign; service flag 1944\u20131957.]]\n|[[Image:Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|thumb|150px|Modified Red Ensign; service flag 1957\u20131965.]]\n|[[Image:Flag of Canada (Pantone).svg|thumb|150px|Canadian national flag; service flag; 1965\u2013present.]]\n|}\n\n===Canadian Army command flags===\n{|\n|[[File:Flag of the Canadian Army (1939-1944).svg|thumb|150px|The Canadian Army Battle Flag; command flag 1939\u20131944.

The [[military of New France|military]] of [[New France]] (1608\u20131763) was dependent on the [[French Royal Army (1652\u20131830)|French Royal Army]]. Conversely, the defence of the English/British colonies of [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] (1610\u20131907), and [[Nova Scotia]] (1654\u20131867) was dependent on the [[English Army|English]]/[[British Army]]. After the [[conquest of 1760|British conquest of New France]] in 1760, defence for the French colony of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] (present-day [[Ontario]], and [[Quebec]]), and [[Prince Edward Island|St. John's Island]] was also reliant on the British Army. Both the British and French Armies were augmented by locally recruited [[40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot|regulars]], [[fencibles]], and the [[Canadian militia]]. Many of these units were activated in times of war, but remained inactive in between.\n[[File:Battle of Chateauguay.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Chateauguay]] during the [[War of 1812]]. In the battle, locally raised [[fencibles]], [[Canadian militia|militia]], and Mohawk warriors, repulsed an American assault for Montreal.]]\nDuring the War of 1812, [[Canadian units of the War of 1812|locally raised Canadian units]], including fencibles, and militia units from [[the Canadas]], [[New Brunswick]], Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia served alongside regular units of the British Army. These fencible and militia units played an instrumental role during the conflict. The history and heritage, as well as the War of 1812 battle honours awarded to many of these units, are perpetuated by current units within the Canadian Army.\n\nWhile Canada developed a volunteer [[militia]] force of partially trained and often unpaid amateurs, defence of the country was dependent on a contingent of regular British soldiers, as well as naval defence through the [[Royal Navy]]. The Canadian Militia evolved from the various British garrison forces on the North American continent in the 19th century. In 1854, with the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]], virtually the entire British garrison was pulled out of British North America to fight against Russia, and with many American politicians saying this was the opportune moment for the United State to realize its \"[[manifest destiny]]\" by annexing British North America, the government of the United Canadas, consisting of Canada West (modern Ontario) and Canada East (modern Quebec) passed the [[Militia Act of 1855]] to create an active militia that was essentially a professional army, through not labelled as such.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=79-80}} The \"active militia\" consisted of 5,000 men.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=86}} The Canadian Army is a direct descendant of the \"active duty militia\" force created in 1855. Upon Canadian Confederation in 1867, the ground forces in Canada continued to be referred to as the Militia. Using the \"active duty militia\" of the United Canadas as its core, Parliament passed the Militia Act of 1868 merging the militias of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into the militia of the United Canadas.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=90}} In February 1869, the Defence minister, Sir [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], told the House of Commons that the Militia had 37,170 men under arms and 618, 896 in reserve.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=90}}\n[[File:Funeral of Canadian volunteers killed at Ridgeway in the Fenian Invasion (St. James cemetery, Toronto) Pictures-r-1310.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral for members of the Volunteer Militias killed during the [[Battle of Ridgeway]] at [[St. James Cemetery]], [[Toronto]].]]\nThe primary action that the newly formed militia saw was from the [[Fenian Brotherhood|Fenians]], a group of Irish radicals who made [[Fenian raids|several attempts]] in the late 19th century to invade some parts of southern Canada from the United States. The period of the Fenian raids in the 1860s and early 1870s was the peak of the efficiency of the Canadian militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=89}} In 1866, at the [[Battle of Ridgeway]] the Fenians defeated the Canada West militia owing to the inexperience of the militiamen, but in 1870 the Quebec militia drove back the Fenians at Trout River and [[Battle of Eccles Hill|Eccles Hill]] with little trouble.{{sfn|Morton|1999|=89}}  In 1869, Canada purchased for $1.5 million the vast proprietary colony of [[Rupert's Land]] run by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] that comprised all of northern Quebec, northern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}} The 10,000 people, many of them [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] in the [[Red River Colony]] in what is now southern Manitoba, were not consulted about the sale, and under the leadership of [[Louis Riel]] rebelled, setting up a provisional government to negotiate their admission to Confederation.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}} [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] of the Hudson's Bay Company had been appointed to negotiate with Riel by Ottawa and arranged a settlement under which Canada would create a new province called Manitoba in exchange for the M\u00e9tis laying down their arms.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}} However, the execution of [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]], an Orangeman from Ontario, by the M\u00e9tis, created much fury in Ontario, a province where the Loyal Orange Order was a major political force.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}} To placate voters in Ontario, an expedition was sent to down the [[Red River Rebellion]].{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}} In 1870, an Anglo-Canadian force consisting of the 400 men from British [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] with the rest being Ontario militiamen, consisting of 1,044 men in total under the command of General [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Garnet Wolseley]] made an gruelling march across northern Ontario to the Red River colony.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}} Riel fled and the rebellion ended without any fighting, and the terms already agreed upon between Smith and Riel were implemented with Manitoba becoming the 5th province{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=92}}\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)]] and the end of the Fenian raids, the British began to downsize their garrisons in Canada, mainly to move troops to other areas of the [[British Empire|Empire]], but also due to friendlier relations with the [[United States]], Canada's immediate neighbour, and the only country capable of launching an armed invasion of the country. In 1871, the British garrisons in Canada were almost completely pulled out with British garrisons remaining only in Halifax and Esquimalt.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=79-80}} After 1871, the responsibility for the defence of Canada rested with the Dominion government.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=80}} \n[[File:Royal Military College of Canada cadets train with armstrong field guns c 1885; Stone Frigate.jpg|thumb|Cadets of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] with several [[Armstrong Gun]]s (c. 1885).

The Canadian historian Ren\u00e9 Chartrand wrote: \"The government's traditional policy was to spend as little as possible on defence while keeping up a basic military force\".{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=33}} As maintaining the non-permanent active militia was the cheapest option, this was the one that Ottawa pursued.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=33}}\n\nIn 1876, the [[Royal Military College of Canada|Royal Military College]] was founded to train officers for the Permanent Active Militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=79-80}} Owing to the lack of officers, British Army officers continued to be seconded to serve as the senior commanders of the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=90}}  'A' and 'B' Batteries of Garrison Artillery were formed as the first units of Canada's permanent military force in 1871 in Kingston and Quebec City respectively, with a third ('C' Battery) authorized in 1883 and formed in 1887 in Esquimalt.

Middeleton's successor as the commander of the militia, Colonel [[Ivor Herbert, 1st Baron Treowen|Ivor Herbert]], proved to be a reformer who first revealed to the Canadian press that the ratio of officers in the militia to the privates was 1:2.24 in 1894.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=109}} Herbert also created the post of quartermaster general to tend to the supply notes and appointed another British

millionaire Conservative MP and militia officer offered at his own expense to raise a regiment to fight in South Africa, an offer that appalled Hutton, who realized Hughes's proposal offered Laurier an excuse not to send a Canadian force to South Africa and attempted to silence Hughes, who would not be silenced.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=114}} Within the cabinet Richard Scott and Israel Tarte were opposed to Canada fighting in South Africa while [[Henri Bourassa]], a Liberal back-bencher had emerged as the leading voice in the House of Commons opposed to an expedition to South Africa.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=114}} On 3 October, Laurier received a Colonial Office circular thanking his government for its \"offer\" of 250 men to South Africa, an offer that he not made while at the same time the October 1899 edition of ''Canadian Military Gazette'' published the details of a plan to mobilize 1,200 men for South Africa.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=114}} Caught on the spot, Laurier received a note on 9 October from the editor of the Liberal ''Toronto Globe'' saying he \"must either send troops or get out of office\" as the majority of voters in Ontario wanted Canada to fight in South Africa.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=115}} Caught between the conflicting pressures in English-Canada and French-Canada, Laurier announced on 14 October that Canada would raise and equip an all-volunteer force to South Africa that once it arrived would operate under British command and be paid for by Britain.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=114}} Laurier did not summon Parliament for a vote as he knew that the Liberal caucus would split between the English-Canadian MPs and French-Canadian MPs, and instead his decision was announced as an order-in-council.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=115}} On 30 October, a hastily raised force of 1, 061 volunteers left Quebec City abroad the SS ''Sardinian'' (called \"the Sardine\" by its passengers for cramped conditions) for Cape Town under the command of Colonel William Otter.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=115}} At their first battle, the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] the Canadians performed well, and on 27 February 1900 a battalion from the Maritimes end up holding their own ground after a confusing night battle, which just happened to be the moment that the Transvaal General [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] chose to surrender, leading to the British and Canadian press to credit the victory to the Canadians, which gave a tremendous boost to Canadian self-confidence.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=116}} In the warm glow of victory, Laurier agreed to send another 1,320 volunteers to South Africa while the millionaire Lord Strathcona raised a regiment at his own expense in western Canada, recruiting cowboys to form [[Strathcona's Horse]] regiment for South Africa.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=116}}\n[[File:First mounted review of Strathcona Horse at Ottawa, Ontario, 7th March, 1900 (HS85-10-11271).jpg|thumb|left|First mounted review of [[Lord Strathcona's Horse

equipment and uniforms were not mentioned.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=117-118}} British Army officers often complained that many of the Canadian officers were inexperienced, incompetent or politically well connected with the worse offender being Colonel Hughes who regarded himself as above taking orders from anybody.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=117-118}} Lord Dundonald, the British Army officer who commanded the militia after the Boer War suggested the idea of a \"skeleton army\" of well trained militia officers who would form the nucleus if the militia were mobilized for war again.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=119}} Dundonald's ideas were generally adopted, but Dundonald's attempts to involve himself in Canadian politics led to his dismissal on 10 June 1904 as the government announced it was intolerable that a serving officer should be speaking on political issues.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=120}}\n\nIn 1904, a new Militia Act was passed to reform the militia by making Canadian officers the equal of British officers and removing the governor-general from exercising command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=119-120}} Laurier had neither forgotten nor forgiven [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]], the Governor-General, for his role in pressuring him to send a force to South Africa in 1899.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=120}} In 1904, Colonel Otter became the first Canadian chief of staff for the militia through a British officer, Colonel Percy Lake, was appointed inspector general of the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=120}} To remedy one of the great defects that had been revealed by the Boer War, [[Eug\u00e8ne Fiset]], a Boer War veteran turned deputy minister of the militia, insisted on improving the medical corps of the militia, saying he had seen too many men die in South Africa because of poor hygiene.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=121}} On 1 July 1905, the last British garrisons were pulled out of Canada and the responsibility for defending the naval bases at Halifax and Esquimalt was assigned to the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=121}} The fact the Royal Military College in Kingston only offered instruction in English and English was the sole language of command ensured that French-Canadians were under-represented in the officer corps as English was generally not taught in Quebec's Catholic schools.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=5}}\n\nSir Samuel Hughes, who became the minister of defence and militia in 1911 after the Conservatives won the general election that year, become the dominating force in Canadian defence policy.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=8}} Hughes was described by the Canadian historian Ren\u00e9 Chartrand as a man of tremendous energy, charisma and a forceful personality who was also a megalomaniac with a grotesquely inflated sense of his own importance and a \"stubborn, pompous racist\" who did little to disguise his anti-Catholic and anti-French views.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=8}} As the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, was afraid of Hughes, the militia minister played an oversized role in defence decision-making.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=8-9}} In 1912, Hughes forbade militia regiments from marching in Catholic processions as they traditionally done in Quebec since 1867, a move that caused much controversy at the time.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}} Through Hughes justified his move under grounds as upholding secularism, Quebec newspapers blamed it on the prejudices of the Orangemen that the militia minister surrounded himself with.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}}\n\nHughes was able to raise the level of military spending from $7 million in 1911 to $11 million in 1914, but little of the money went to the Permanent Force, which Hughes was openly hostile to, praising the militia as embodiment of the authentic fighting spirit of Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=127}} Some of the ways in which Hughes allocated the increased military budget such as giving a free Ford Model T car to every militia colonel in Canada and going on an all expenses junket to Europe in 1913 to observe military maneuvers caused much controversy.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}} Hughes wanted to make militia service compulsory, which he justified under moral, not military grounds, saying in a 1913 speech that he wanted \"To make the youth of Canada self-controlled, erect, decent and patriotic through military and physical training, instead of growing up as under present conditions of no control, into young ruffians or young gadabouts...to make the military camps and drill throughout Canada clean, wholesome, sober and attractive to boys and young men; to give that final tough to imperial unity, and crown the arch of responsible government by an inter-Imperial Parliament dealing only with Imperial affairs\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}} A strong believer in temperance, Hughes also saw militia service as a way of promoting his \"dry\" views, believing he stamp out the evils of alcoholism in Canada by having every man serve in the militia.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=128}}\n\nBased on his own experiences of the Boer War, Hughes believed that Canadian soldiers were much better soldiers than the British, and it was because of Hughes, the Canadians fought together as a separate expeditionary force in World War I. The staff officers had developed a plan for mobilizing the militia in the event of the war, which Hughes disregarded in August 1914 by creating an entirely new organization called the Canadian Expeditionary Force, which was to consist of numbered battalions that had no connection with the militia regiments.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=9}} Reflecting his own beliefs about the superiority of Canadians over the British as soldiers, Hughes fought hard to ensure that the divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force be commanded by Canadian generals, and very reluctantly accepted British officer, Lieutenant General Edwin Alderson, as the commander of the 1st Canadian Division and only then because of the lack of a qualified Canadian officer.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=137}} Alderson found Hughes a difficult man to deal with as the defence minister insisted on involving himself in matters that were normally the concern of a defence minister and because the Canadian nationalist Hughes insisted on equipping the Canadian Expeditionary Force with Canadian-made equipment as much as possible, regardless of whether it was practical or not.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=137}}\n\n==Expansion and the World Wars (1901\u20131945)==\nAfter Canadian participation in the [[Second Boer War]], the need for domestic supporting organizations was made evident. Canada in short order formed its own [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps|Permanent Active Militia Army Medical Corps]], [[Royal Canadian Army Veterinary Corps|Canadian Army Veterinary Corps]], [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals|Signalling Corps]], [[Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps|Ordnance Stores Corps]] and [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps|Canadian Army Service Corps]].  During the [[First World War]] a [[Canadian Provost Corps]] was also created.

October 1916.]]\n{{Main|Military history of Canada during the First World War}}\nCanadian participation in the [[First World War]] began with the unusual step of scrapping all mobilization plans, and creating a field force from scratch.\n\nIn 1914, the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] (CEF) was created in response to a call by the United Kingdom for soldiers.  The CEF was a separate entity from the [[Permanent Active Militia]] (by now also known as the Permanent Force, or PF) and the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]] or NPAM.  Regiments and other units of the Militia were not mobilized, but rather transferred personnel to the CEF for overseas employment. The CEF was disbanded after the war.\n\n===Interwar period modernization===\nThe [[William Dillon Otter|Otter]] Committee reorganized the [[Canadian Militia]] in 1920, instituting a series of perpetuations so that both the pre-war Militia and the CEF had their traditions and histories integrated into the modern Canadian forces. The numbered pre-war regiments were all reorganized and redesignated; the archaic system of numbered regiments in the cavalry and infantry was dropped, with several exceptions such as [[1st Hussars]], the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] (originally the 22nd (Canadien-Fran\u00e7ais) Battalion, CEF), and the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]] (48th Battalion (Highlanders)).\n\nIn 1936, the Non-Permanent Active Militia had six tank battalions created as part of the infantry, the first step towards modernization. Canada's land forces underwent two major organizational changes between the world wars; in 1920 the pre-war regiments were all renamed, several organizational corps were created mirroring corps in the British Army, and new ones like the Canadian Machine Gun Corps or CMGC (not to be confused with the wartime corps of the same name) were created.  The new regiments all perpetuated the history of the wartime CEF, and when [[battle honour]]s were granted many years later, were permitted to adopt those battle honours.\n\nIn 1936, the CMGC was abolished and the Militia again underwent dramatic reorganizations, with three types of infantry regiments being created (rifle, machine gun, and tank).  Many regiments were disbanded or amalgamated.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Military history of Canada during World War II}}\nThe [[Second World War]] saw major changes to the Canadian Militia. Acting on the suggestion of General [[Harry Crerar]], the Militia were renamed as the Canadian Army through an [[Order in Council]] on 19 November 1940.<ref name=offichist>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/themes/defence/caf/militaryhistory/dhh/official/book-1955-army-ww2-1-en.pdf|page=89|work=Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War Volume I: The Army in Canada, Britain and the Pacific|publisher=Ministry of National Defence (Canada)|last=Stacey|first=Charles Perry|year=1955|title=The Army Programme for 1941}}</ref> PAM was reorganized as Canadian Army (Active), whereas NPAM became Canadian Army (Reserve).<ref name=offichist/> Many infantry regiments were transferred to the [[Canadian Armoured Corps]], created the same year.

The taking of Juno Beach was primarily the responsibility of the Canadian Army.]]\nIn 1939, the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) was mobilized; similar to the CEF, this was a mobilization of prewar PF and NPAM units, who retained their traditional titles. In 1940, the land forces of Canada were retitled. The CASF became the Canadian Army (Overseas), the Permanent Force became the Canadian Army (Active) and the NPAM became the Canadian Army (Reserve). The Canadian Army (Overseas) ceased to exist after the Second World War. A new Canadian Armoured Corps was created and many infantry regiments were reroled to fight in tanks. At home, the [[Atlantic Command (Canadian Army)|Atlantic Command]] and [[Pacific Command (Canadian Army)|Pacific Command]] were created to direct home defence efforts.\n\nA desire to have an entire French-Canadian brigade was thwarted by a lack of francophone staff officers.<ref>See Granatstein, ''The Generals''.</ref> The original mobilization scheme grouped infantry battalions by region; the [[1st Brigade (Canada)|1st Brigade]] was an Ontario brigade, the [[2nd Brigade (Canada)|2nd]] from Western Canada and the [[3rd Brigade (Canada)|3rd]] from the Maritimes. The [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division|2nd Division]] was supposed to follow the same lines, but after deployments to Iceland, the Western Canadian and Quebec brigades were mixed and no attempt was made with the [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd]], [[4th Canadian Division|4th]] or [[5th Canadian Division|5th Division]]s to organize regionally. The [[5th Canadian Infantry Brigade|5th Brigade]] was originally to be an all-Quebec brigade, with one anglophone and two francophone regiments. While French Canada was represented by four overseas French-speaking infantry battalions, and the Canadian Army did attempt to produce training literature in French, it would not be until after Unification that French and English soldiers would have equal career opportunities.\n[[Image:Canadianmortarteam.jpg|thumb|Canadian mortar team in action in France, c. 1944.]]\nThe [[6th Canadian Infantry Division|6th]], [[7th Canadian Infantry Division|7th]] and [[8th Canadian Infantry Division|8th Division]]s were home defence divisions and contained a large number of troops conscripted under the [[National Resources Mobilization Act]] (NRMA) which by law could not serve \"overseas\". One brigade did go to the Aleutians in 1943 to fight the Japanese on the technicality that it was North American soil, though no contact with the enemy was made. In November 1944, on hearing that the [[Government of Canada|government]] had decided to send conscripts overseas, a number of soldiers based in [[Terrace, British Columbia]], [[mutiny|mutinied]]. The [[Terrace Mutiny]] was the largest insurrection in [[Military history of Canada|Canadian military history]].\n\nThe use of irregular forces became common in western Canada during the Second World War, with the [[Pacific Coast Militia Rangers]] being formed in 1942; disbanded after 1945, they were the inspiration for the [[Canadian Rangers]].\n\n==== Veterans Guard of Canada====\nAs with the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the Veterans Guard of Canada was initially formed in the early days of the Second World War as a defence force in case of an attack on Canadian soil. Composed largely of First World War veterans it included, at its peak, 37 Active and Reserve companies with 451 officers and 9,806 other ranks. Over 17,000 veterans served in the force over the course of the war. Active companies served full-time in Canada as well as overseas, including a General Duty Company attached to Canadian Military Headquarters in London, England, No. 33 Coy. in the Bahamas, No. 34 Coy. in British Guiana and Newfoundland, and a smaller group dispatched to India. The Veterans Guard were involved in a three-day prisoner of war uprising in 1942, known as the [[Battle of Bowmanville]]. Along with its home defence role, the Veterans Guard assumed responsibility for guarding internment camps from the Canadian Provost Corps, which helped release younger Canadians for service overseas. The Guards were disbanded in 1947.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/html/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=V&page=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205034/http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/html/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=V&page=1 |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Early Cold War (1946\u20131968)==\nThe Canadian Army underwent many changes after the Second World War, including redesignations. The full-time component became the Canadian Army Active Force and the part-time component the Canadian Army Reserve Force.\n\nBefore 1930 the Canadian Army was a small cadre of professional soldiers augmented by civilian volunteers and, in the Second World War, conscripts.  It was basically a colonial institution that closely followed the traditions, doctrine and training routines of the British Army. After 1945, Canada began breaking loose from Britain in many regards, including the military. At issue was professionalization. The modernizing faction of the Army called for a very well-educated officer corps that was capable of interacting with political and diplomatic elites in Ottawa, and giving the military its own voice in national decisions. However, the traditionalist element emphasized the wisdom and preserving regimental traditions, and said leadership should be based on middle and upper-class status. Invariably, this meant senior officers of British descent, as opposed to French or Irish or other ethnic backgrounds. The tension between modernizers and traditionalists lead to stalemate, and a failure to develop modern management. The modernizers pointed to the failure of professional norms in the 1993 [[Somalia Affair|Somalia peacekeeping fiasco]]. In recent decades, the reformers have developed a \"constabulary-realist\" model of professionalism.<ref>Peter Kasurak, \"Concepts of Professionalism in the Canadian Army, 1946\u20142000: Regimentalism, Reaction, and Reform.\" ''Armed Forces & Society'' 37#1 (2011): 95\u2013118.</ref>\n\n===Korean War===\n{{Main|Canada in the Korean War}}\n[[File:Captain Claxton Ray Lt.

A planned changeover to US-designed weapons equipment had been planned for the 1950s, but the emergency in Korea forced the use of war stocks of Second World War\u2013vintage British-designed weapons. On 5 February 1951, at a time when the Chinese were advancing in Korea, the Defence Minister, Brooke Claxton, announced in the House of Commons an emergency military budget of $5 billion which committed the government to raise an infantry division within the next three years and committed a brigade to Europe at once.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} At the time, it was believed that Stalin had ordered the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950 as a part of an diversion to tie down Western forces in Korea as a prelude to a Soviet invasion of West Germany.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=236}} Consequently, Canada followed the United States in increasing forces for the defence of West Germany instead of South Korea during the Korean War.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=236}} On 16 January 1951, General Dwight Eisenhower, the NATO Supreme Allied Commander, visited Ottawa to tell the Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and his cabinet that he believed there was a possibility the Red Army would invade West Germany in the near-future and help from Canada was needed at once.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=236}}\n\nUltimately, Canada promised two divisions to the defence of West Germany.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} A major dispute arose between General Charles Foulkes, chief of the defence staff and General Guy Simomds, chief of the army staff over whatever the Canadian contingent would serve under U.S or British command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} Foulkes had served under Simonds in World War Two, and the two generals were well known for their acrimonious relations as Simonds always took the view that Foulkes was incompetent.  Simonds successfully argued that for historical reasons and because of doubts about the combat efficiency of the U.S Army that the Canadians should serve as part of the British Army of the Rhine in northern Germany.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} The way in which the North Koreans had driven the Americans back to the Pusan perimeter in the summer of 1950 followed by the Chinese victory along the Yalu in November 1950 had \"shocked\" Canadian decision-makers and created major doubts about the quality of the U.S. Army.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}}  In the late 1950s, Canada adopted a variety of weapons of [[Europe]]an, British and US design rather than proceeding with its planned Americanization.\n\n===Post-Korea===\nAside from providing a field force for the Korean War, few operational missions existed until the rise of [[peacekeeping]] in the 1960s.\n\nPrior to the [[Coronation of the British Monarch|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], the Canadian Army was the only [[British Empire|Imperial]]/[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation to have provided the [[King's Guard]] in [[London]]. In the lead up, the contingent of Canadian troops sent for the coronation provided the guard during June 1953, along with an equivalent unit of the [[Australian Army]].\n\nDuring the early 1950s the Army advertised in British newspapers for British ex-servicemen to join the Canadian Army. These recruits were transported to Canada for training. After a 6-month trial period the soldiers' families were allowed to emigrate to join the father. Transport was usually by scheduled sea transport. In 1954, the report of the Kennedy Board was tabled, giving suggestions for reorganizing the Militia.

G. Simonds, the [[Commander of the Canadian Army|Chief of the General Staff]]. The reason for this expansion was the need to maintain a presence in Germany as part of NATO, while simultaneously providing forces for the Korean War. Simonds stated that the shipping to transport large armies to Europe was not available, any Canadian soldiers wanting to fight in World War Three in Europe should it begin best be there when the war began.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=237}} From 1950 to 1953, the Canadian military ballooned from having 47,000 personnel to 104,000 personnel by 1953.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}} Despite the increasing size, General Guy Simonds complained that the Army was not attracting enough men with the necessary specialized skills and spoke of peacetime conscription, only to be silenced by the Defence minister Brooke Claxton, who warned him that with public opinion polls showing that 83% of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois opposed to conscription, that this was too politically risky.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}}  Initially, six new regular infantry battalions were raised by regiments of the Militia \u2013 two were raised from ordinary line infantry regiments, two from regiments of rifles and two from regiments of Highlanders. When the decision was made to make this arrangement permanent, it was decided that the battalions would become regular battalions of regiments. The decision was taken to make the rifles and highland battalions part of two of the senior existing militia regiments, while the infantry battalions were organised into a new national regiment:\n*1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Battalions \u2013 3rd and 4th Battalions, [[Canadian Guards]] (Raised by the [[Carleton and York Regiment]], the [[Algonquin Regiment]], the [[Loyal Edmonton Regiment]], les [[Fusiliers Mont-Royal]] and the [[Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]].)\n*1st and 2nd Canadian Rifle Battalions \u2013 1st and 2nd Battalions, [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]] (Raised by the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, the [[Victoria Rifles of Canada]], the [[Royal Winnipeg Rifles]], the [[Regina Rifle Regiment]] and the [[Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment)]].)\n*1st and 2nd Canadian Highland Battalions \u2013 1st and 2nd Battalions, [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] (Raised by the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, the [[North Nova Scotia Highlanders]], [[48th Highlanders of Canada]], the [[Seaforth Highlanders of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's)]].)\n\nSimonds was a great believer in ''esprit de corps'' as a way of motivating soldiers to fight, and he quite consciously sought to build on the history and traditions of the Canadian Army to provide men serving in the Army with a reason to feel pride in their regiments, and hence a willingness to fight for their regimental honor.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}} It was for this reason that Simonds had militia regiments like the Black Watch of Montreal, the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto and the Fort Garry Horse of Winnipeg transferred over to the regular army instead of raising new regiments, and created a Regiment of Canadian Guards who were closely modeled after the [[Brigade of Guards]] who protected the royal family in London, right down to the scarlet uniforms and bearskin hats.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238}} By 1953, the defence budget was $1, 907 million dollars, ten times the level of 1947, and the end of the Korean War did not mark the end of the high level of military spending as the end of the Boer War and the two world wars had done, making the 1950s\u201360s the only period why the Canadian government ever spent large sums on defence in peacetime.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238-239}} The 1950s and 1960s are remembered as something of a \"golden age\" for the military as for once the chronic problems caused by under-funding by Ottawa in peacetime did not exist.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=238-239}} Unlike the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force, whose personnel were overwhelmingly English-Canadians and where English was the sole language of command, the Canadian Army was the only service that made some allowance for French-Canadians.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=239}} In 1952, the Army opened the Coll\u00e8ge Militaire Royal de Saint-Jean to train French-Canadian officer candidates in French (previously all officer candidates had been trained in English at the Royal Military College).{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=239}} However, the Canadian Army was still a mostly English-speaking institution in the 1950s with the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment and the 8th Hussars being the only regiments in the regular army that were for French-Canadians.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=239}}\n\nIn the early 1950s Canada sent a brigade to [[West Germany]] as part of its [[NATO]] commitment after the creation of that alliance in 1949. The [[27th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] later became [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]], which remained stationed in West Germany and later the unified Germany until the 1990s and the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe future of the Army was put in doubt in the age of nuclear deterrence. The postwar Militia (the part-time component of the Canadian Army) was reroled from combat operations to civil defence. In 1964 the Suttie Commission made suggestions on improving the Army. In 1968, [[The Canadian Airborne Regiment]], a full-time parachute regiment, was created.\n\n===Unification===\n{{Main|Unification of the Canadian Forces}}\n[[File:Paul Hellyer-c1969.jpg|thumb|As the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], [[Paul Hellyer]] issued [[white paper]]s in 1964 that proposed uniting the Air Force, Army, and Navy into a single service.]]\n[[Paul Hellyer]], the Liberal Defence Minister, had issued a white paper in 1964 proposing to unite the Army, the Air Force and the Navy into one service, arguing that the idea of separate services fighting on land, sea and the air were anachronistic in the modern age.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=250-252}} Hellyer's plans to unify the military provoked much opposition; an essay by General Simonds called Hellyer's ideas nonsense.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} Simonds wrote an Air Force pilot alone in his aircraft decided whatever to fight or flee; a junior naval officer holding the equivalent rank as the air force pilot had the decision to fight decided by his captain for him; and a junior Army officer holding the equivalent rank as the naval and air force officers had to decide not only to fight or flee for himself, but to persuade the men under his command to fight as well.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} General Simonds argued the different environments of war at land, air, and sea required different leadership styles and Hellyer's plans to merge all three services into one threatened to dissolve what was necessary for officers in each service.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} Hellyer's Chief of the Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal [[Frank Robert Miller]], resigned in protest against unification, as did two generals who resigned in 1964 and seven admirals in 1966.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}}\n\nAfter Air Marshal Miller resigned, Hellyer appointed General [[Jean Victor Allard]] as Chief of the Defence Staff, who supported unification as a way of promoting the \"French fact\" in the military.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} General Allard, who had served with the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment in Italy in World War II and in Korea, had a distinguished combat record, but also described by the historian Desmond Morton as a \"chronic opportunist\" who was forever seeking a way to ingratitude himself with those who held power.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} Furthermore, the French-Canadian Allard believed the military was too British and felt that unification and \"Canadianizing\" the military would encourage more French-Canadians to enlist.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} The resignations of the officers failed to move public opinion with most Canadians being apathetic about Hellyer's plans for unification.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} Newspaper cartoonists frequently ridiculed the officers who resigned as an absurd Colonel Blimp types who were anachronistically clinging to British traditions and old-fashioned ideas about war in the modern age while Hellyer was depicted as a bold visionary and a technocratic elitist whose plans to merge the three services into one were in tune with the ''zeitgeist''.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}} An ambitious man, Hellyer had championed unification to present himself as an innovative leader as he openly aspired to be prime minister one day, and in general the media took his side against his military critics.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=251-252}} In a 1966 editorial, the ''Winnipeg Free Press'' stated that Hellyer had \"earned the nation's gratitude and its continued support\" while in the same year the ''Vancouver Sun'' in an editorial declared that \"young Mr. Hellyer seems to be quietly pulling off what may in time be recorded as this government's greatest achievement\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=251-252}}\n\nIn the face of much opposition from the Conservative MPs and with the use of closure, Parliament passed Hellyer's Canadian Forces Reorganization Bill on 25 April 1967.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}}  On 1 July 1967 to mark the Centennial of Canadian confederation, a huge Centennial tattoo was held in Ottawa with all three services marching together to celebrate both Centennial and \"their vanishing traditions\" with many participating noting that this was the end of their services.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=253}}  The Army was integrated with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] on February 1, 1968, under the policy of [[Unification of the Canadian Forces|Unification]]. The newly formed [[Canadian Forces]] was the first combined military force in the modern world. The Army became known as Force Mobile Command. Helicopter operations, briefly instituted under Army purview in the early 1960s, transferred to [[Canadian Forces Air Command|Air Command]].\n\nMost of the pre-unification corps that had been created in the early 20th century were disbanded; they were merged with counterparts in the Navy and Air Force to form the [[personnel branch]]es of the CF. The move toward unification, as well as other budget and cost-cutting moves during the 1980s and 1990s were vehemently opposed by many and is sometimes regarded as a fault in the Canadian Forces. The majority of veterans and those serving at the time objected to this initiative; with many, including senior officers, leaving the military altogether. One of the most controversial aspects of unification was Hellyer's decision to abolish the traditional British style uniforms of the Canadian Army together with those of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force to impose a common green American style uniform on the entire Canadian Forces.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}}  As part of his drive to \"Canadianize\" the military, Hellyer also abolished the traditional British style ranks and replaced them with American style ranks.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=252}} On 16 August 2011, the Canadian Government restored the names of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force to the existing maritime, land and air commands; although the unified command and structure of the CF remains.\n\n*[[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]] and [[Royal Canadian Dental Corps]]\u2014became the [[Canadian Forces Medical Service]] and Canadian Forces Dental Service respectively; in the 1990s, both the CFMS and CFDS combined together administratively as the '''Canadian Forces Health Services''' (though both still wear their individual branch insignia)\n*[[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals]]\u2014became the [[Communications and Electronics Branch]]. In 2013 the army component of the branch regained the title Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.\n*[[Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps]] amalgamated with supply and transport services of [[Royal Canadian Army Service Corps]]\u2014became the Logistics Branch. Renamed in 2018 to [[Royal Canadian Logistics Service]]\n*[[Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]]\u2014became Land Ordnance Engineering, then [[Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Branch]], then back to Corps of Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 2013\n*Clerical trades of Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, [[Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps]], and [[Royal Canadian Postal Corps]]\u2014became the Administration Branch (later merged with the Logistics Branch, and as of 2018 is the Royal Canadian Logistics Service.)\n*[[Canadian Provost Corps]] and [[Canadian Intelligence Corps]]\u2014became the [[Canadian Forces Military Police|Security Branch]]. Both elements split apart in 1982 to the Security Branch and [[Intelligence Branch]]. In 2017, Army Intelligence Officers and Operators of the Intelligence Branch once more became members of the Canadian Intelligence Corps, which remains a part of the overall Intelligence Branch.\n\n==Post-unification and the late-Cold War (1969\u20131991)==\n{{See also|Structure of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1989#Mobile Command}}\nIn 1968, the new Liberal Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau promised a re-evaluation of Canada's defence commitments and for a time in 1968\u201369 seriously considered pulling out of NATO.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=254-255}} Ultimately, Trudeau chose to stay in NATO in order to maintain good relations with the United States and the western European states, all of whom would object if Canada were to leave NATO. On 3 April 1969, Trudeau announced in a speech the new priorities of the Canadian Forces in this order:\n*The \"surveillance\" of Canada to provide protection against external and internal threats as the number one mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \n*Working in co-operation with the United States in the defence of North America as the number two mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \n*The defence of western Europe as per Canada's NATO commitments as the number three mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \n*United Nations peace-keeping missions as the number four mission.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} \nIn May 1969, the Defence Minister, [[L\u00e9o Cadieux]], visited the capitals of western Europe to tell the leaders of the western European states that Canada would be drastically cutting its NATO commitments later that year, and henceforward, Canada's role in NATO would be only to provide token contributions to the defence of western Europe.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} On 23 June 1969, Cadieux announced to the House of Commons drastic cuts in defence spending as Canada's  commitments to NATO were going to be reduced.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} In June 1969 in a speech to the graduating class at Queen's University, Trudeau warned that United States was descending into anarchy with race riots and student protests, and the violence in the United States could \"easily spill\" into Canada, which he claimed required more soldiers in Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=256}} In September 1969, it was announced that half of the Canadian Forces stationed in West Germany were to be pulled out with the remainder to be moved to Lahr in southern West Germany to operate under American operational command; previously, the Canadian Forces in West Germany had been stationed in northern West Germany under British operational command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} The historical links between the British and Canadian armies ended in 1969.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} The major operation for the Canadian Forces in 1969 was domestic when the ''Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al'' went on strike on 7 October 1969, leading to [[Murray-Hill riot|rioting]] in Montreal that required the Army to put down.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=256}} In 1970 Cadieux's successor as Defence Minister, [[Donald Stovel Macdonald|Donald Macdonald]], announced to the House of Commons that the safeguarding Canada's sovereignty and helping with \"the social and economic development of Canada\" were the main purpose of the Canadian Forces.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=255}} In a 1970 white paper, ''Defence in the Seventies'', it was announced the \"Priority One\" of the Canadian Forces was now internal security, with the future enemy now envisioned as the FLQ instead of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=256}}\n\nThe Regular Force was downsized in 1970, and the number of regular infantry battalions was reduced from 13 to 10. This was achieved by reducing the [[Canadian Guards]] to nil strength, returning both the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada to their militia only status and rebadging soldiers into three new battalions of the remaining Regular Regiments. The Regular Force regiment of [[The Fort Garry Horse]] and the 4th Regiment [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]] were reduced to nil strength and placed on the Supplementary Order of battle on 16 June 1970.<ref>Canadian Forces Publication A-DH-267-003/AF-001 \u2013 Part One: Armour, Artillery and Field Engineer Regiments</ref>\n\nIn October 1970, during the [[October Crisis]], the army was called out as an aid to civil power with the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment being deployed to guard government buildings in Montreal on 15 October 1970.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=257}}  The deployment was not popular with the senior leaders of the Canadian Forces, who feared correctly that Trudeau would use the October Crisis as a reason for his \"Priority One\" of internal security.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=257}} In keeping with Trudeau's \"Priority One\" of internal security as the prime mission of the Canadian Forces, throughout the 1970s the Canadian Forces were described as having \"stagnated\", with budget cuts reducing both the size of the Canadian Forces and the amount of equipment available for operations.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=259-261}}  In 1976, as a favour to his close personal friend, West German chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]], and to improve trade talks with the European Economic Community, the Trudeau government purchased 128 German Leopard tanks for Mobile Command.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=260}} The Leopard tanks were already outclassed by Red Army [[T-72]]s and would have served little purpose in the event of World War Three, but were felt to be useful for \"Priority One\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=260-262}} Likewise, 400 Swiss-built armoired vehicles were purchased and stationed at various bases and armouries across the country that were meant for the \"Priority One\" of putting down riots, not war, through their purpose was described only as \"peacekeeping\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=262}} Reflecting the \"Priority One\" of internal security, by the end of the 1970s the Mobile Command had become an internal security force that was not capable of fighting a major conventional war.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=261-262}}\n\nMorton wrote the \"drastic 1969 force reduction\" caused the combat efficiency of the Canadian Forces to \"dwindle\" in the 1970s.<ref name=\"auto\">Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', p.261.</ref> The frequent rotation of defence ministers with 7 men holding the portfolio between 1971\u201379 meant there were no defence ministers who ever really understood their portfolio, which led to much confusion and a lack of direction from the top.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Moreover, the Department of National Defence was considered to be unglamorous portfolio that the more abler ministers in the Trudeau cabinet wanted to avoid, and Morton wrote all of the defence ministers of the 1970s were mediocrities.<ref>Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', p.261</ref> Trudeau had little time for his generals, and starting in 1972 began a programme of \"civilization\", bringing civil servants and \"management experts\" to push aside the senior officers at the Department of National Defence in attempt to \"rationalize\" military decision-making.<ref>Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', p.259.</ref> Despite the effort at \"rationalization\", Trudeau's \"management experts\" caused several expensive debacles with military procurement in the 1970s.<ref>Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'', pp.259\u2013261.</ref>\n\n===Francophone units===\nIn 1967, the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] in its report to Ottawa slammed the Canadian military for mostly operating in English and demanded that more be done to open career opportunities for French-Canadians.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} The Royal Commission criticized the Army for trapping French-Canadians within the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment and a few other units based in Quebec, stating that those French-Canadians who wanted to advance into high command had to serve in what Morton called \"unfamiliar and sometimes inhospitable surroundings outside Quebec\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Because the Army outside of the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment was not seen as friendly towards French-Canadians, very few French-Canadians enlisted and French-Canadian personnel in the Army did not reflect their percentage of the total population of Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Specifically, the royal commission demanded that more French-Canadian units be established outside of Quebec, that all officers holding high command be fluently bilingual and stated that 28% of recruits should be French-Canadian.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} All of the royal commission's recommendations were passed into law, and one consequence of the rule that those holding high command should be bilingual was to give French-Canadian officers something of a monopoly on high command for a generation as most French-Canadian officers were fluent in English while most English-Canadian officers were not fluent in French.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258-259}}\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Canadian Forces committed itself to creating French Language Units (FLUs) and encouraging career opportunities for Francophones. The Minister of National Defence, L\u00e9o Cadieux, announced their creation on April 2, 1968, to include artillery and armoured regiments as well as units of the supporting arms, with two battalions of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] at their core.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} The Army FLUs eventually concentrated at Valcartier and became known as 5<sup>e</sup> Groupement de combat. A French-speaking Regular Force armoured regiment, [[12e R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada|12<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada]], and artillery regiment, [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery|5<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment d'artillerie l\u00e9g\u00e8re du Canada]], were created, and the policy of bilingualism was supported by the first [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], General J.V. Allard. To improve bilingualism, a \"Francotrain\" programme was established to teach English-Canadian officers French and to train French-Canadian recruits in specialist skills.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Morton wrote that: \"From being a virtual anglophone monopoly, the Canadian armed forces came, for a time, to resemble the county they served: two mutually resentful solitudes. Despite Cadieux's hopeful promise that he would not \"divide the force on an unilingual or geographical basis,\" he had done so\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=258}} Ultimately, Morton wrote \"enforced bilingualism was necessary. It was also a success\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=259}} By the 1990s, the journalist [[Jocelyn Coulon]] in his books and essays called the Canadian Forces one of the most successful examples of a truly bilingual institution in Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=259}}\n[[File:Canadian AVGPs.jpg|thumb|A pair of Canadian Army [[AVGP|AVGP Cougar]]s during RENDEZVOUS '83, a [[NATO]] exercise in 1983.

Equipment acquisitions such as the M113 APC and Leopard tank marked a modernization, as did the use of the Cougar and Grizzly AVGP in armoured reconnaissance and mechanized infantry roles.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1984, the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney government won the general election. The Conservative platform promised to undo the neglect of the Trudeau years, but in office the Mulroney government was torn between increasing the military budget; patronage politics which committed the government to rewarding supporters with contracts, which often had no military justification;and a desire to balance the budget.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265}} Morton commented that Mulroney continued the Trudeau tradition of frequent rotation of defence ministers together with \"handing the defence portfolio to weak or worn out ministers\".{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265}}\n\nIn 1985, the Mulroney government restored the different uniforms of the Canadian Forces with the Mobile Command being allowed to wear tan brown uniforms to distinguish them from the Maritime Command and Air Command in a move that was widely welcomed by the rank and file.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265-267}} After Mulroney's first defence minister, [[Robert Coates (politician)|Robert Coates]], was forced to resign after it was revealed that he spent much of a trip to West Germany visiting strip clubs, he was replaced by [[Erik Nielsen]], a Second World War veteran and a \"tough political insider with plenty of experience\" who also served as deputy prime minister.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=265-267}} Neilson was an articulate advocate for the Canadian Forces within the cabinet and was able to increase the military budget with the Canadian brigade in West Germany that had been under-strength ever since 1969 finally brought up to full strength.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=266}} In 1985, the United States sent an icebreaker through the Northwest Passage without Canadian permission, which first awakened interests in  Ottawa about the need to safeguard Canada's claims to Arctic sovereignty{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}}  A wargame was held in 1986 where the [[Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group]] (CAST) was ordered to Norway.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}} The CAST operation was a fiasco and showed Canada could not move a military force to Norway, and by implication the Arctic, with the necessary speed.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}}\n\nIn 1987, the new Defence Minister, [[Perrin Beatty]], brought in a white paper, ''Challenge and Commitment'', proposing a major increase in the military budget with the Army to field three divisions, two for NATO in central Europe, and another for the defence of Canada.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=267}} The white paper also promised to buy a dozen nuclear submarines for the defence of Arctic sovereignty, and this aspect of the white paper generated so much opposition, both at home and in the United States, that nothing came of it.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=268}} The end of the Cold War in 1989\u201390 also marked the beginning of a new era of military cuts.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=268-269}} In 1989, Beatty was replaced as defence minister with Saskatchewan politician [[Bill McKnight]].{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=268}}\n\nAt the very end of the Cold War and the years just after, the Canadian Land Forces began emphasizing a concept of the \"Total Force\" in which greater integration between Regular Force and Reserve Force components was to be achieved, starting in 1987. Unsuccessful experiments during this period included \"10/90 battalions\" which were intended to be ten percent Regular Force and ninety percent reserve force. After a few years, these organizations were all undone.\n\nOther successful and lasting changes included reorganizing regional component headquarters into larger Total Force headquarters.

However, the end of the Meech Lake Accord on 23 June 1990 caused a major surge of support for Quebec separatism with public opinion polls showing that 60% of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois supporting separatism in the aftermath of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} For a time in 1990, Canada appeared to be on the brink of dissolution with many openly wondering when Quebec would leave Confederation.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}}  In this context, the military was seen as the last line to prevent a possible civil war between English-Canadians and French-Canadians. Contributing to the sense of crisis in 1990 and the feeling that Canada was falling apart was the [[Oka Crisis]].\n\nThe Oka crisis began on 11 July 1990 with a shoot-out in Oka between the Mohawk Warrior Society and the ''S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec'' that left one police officer killed.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} In the face of the stand-off with the armed Warrior Society holding land that they claimed belonged to the Mohawk people in Oka and the Mercier bridge linking Montreal to the mainland being occupied by the Mohawk Warrior Society, the Quebec Premier [[Robert Bourassa]] asked for the Army to intervene to maintain \"public safety\" on 17 August 1990.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} Mulroney gave his approval, and the Chief of the Defence Staff, General [[John de Chastelain]], ordered the [[5e Groupe Brigade Mecanisee du Canada]] from their base at Valcartier to Oka and Montreal.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} On 26 August 1990, the soldiers removed with the use of force, but no bloodshed, the Mohawk Warriors who were occupying one end of the Mercier bridge.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}}  After a month of stand-off at Oka, where the soldiers endured much verbal abuse, the Mohawk Warriors abandoned the confrontation and engaged in a melee with the soldiers on 26 September 1990.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}}\n\nThe performance of the French-Canadian soldiers of the Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment during the Oka crisis won the Army unusual praise in generally anti-militarist Quebec, with many Canadians being surprised watching on their TVs at the discipline of the Army in the face of much provocation.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=277}} One consequence of the crises of 1990 was the post-Cold War cuts were not as drastic as expected with the defence minister [[Marcel Masse]] announcing in September 1991 that the Canadian Forces would close their bases in Germany by 1995 and the military were to lose only 10% of their personnel.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=277-288}} In fact, the Canadian bases in Germany at Lahr and Baden-Soellingen were closed on 30 July 1993, two years ahead of schedule, and Canadian Forces Europe was abolished.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=277}}\n\nMobile Command took part in several international missions following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. Aside from playing a minor part in the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Canadian Forces were heavily committed to several UN and NATO missions in the former Yugoslavia which tested the shrinking military's abilities and resources.\n[[File:Canadian Military in Somalia 1992.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers during [[Operation Deliverance]]. While most of the objectives were achieved, the [[Somalia Affair]] was a controversial scandal for the Army, after two soldiers beat a Somali teenager to death.]]\nIn 1995, the [[Canadian Airborne Regiment]] was disbanded after the [[Somalia Affair|Somalia affair]]. Aside from the disbandment of Canada's Airborne Regiment (which did not end parachute capability in the CF, as qualified jumpers were simply reorganized into jump companies of the 3 remaining Regular Force regiments), Somalia had other institutional effects on the military. Chief among these was sensitivity training such as LDA (Leadership in a Diverse Army) and SHARP (Standard for Harassment and Racism Prevention) which became mandatory for all members of the Canadian Forces. The training was a reaction to so-called \"hazing videos\" of members of the Airborne that came to light after the murder in Somalia.\n\nA number of other decisions unrelated to Somalia also reflected changing social values in Canadian society and the Army during the 1990s. Women in Highland regiments were permitted to wear the kilt beginning in the 1990s; a form of dress traditionally gender related. Aboriginals were permitted by regulation to grow long hair in traditional braids, and the turban was accepted as a form of headdress for Sikhs.<ref>The Calgary Highlanders first put females into the kilt for the Queen's Parade on 30 June 1990, and the junior Colour bearer, Lieutenant Harry Sekhon, wore his turban on parade. (CBC news video)</ref>\n\nIn 1995, a Special Commission on the Restructuring of the Reserves was commissioned. In 1998, Force Mobile Command was renamed [[Land Force Command (Canada)|Land Force Command]]. On 15 August 2011, Land Force Command was renamed to the Canadian Army.\n[[File:GuardKandahar.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]] in the [[Kandahar Province]] of [[Afghanistan]].]]\n[[Joint Task Force 2]] was created in the wake of a decision to move counter-terrorism duties from the RCMP to the Canadian Forces. [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Canada participated]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] during which time emergency equipment purchases were made, including world class artillery and armoured Nyala patrol vehicles, replacing aging howitzers and Iltis utility cars. In 2006, a new [[Canadian Special Operations Regiment]] was created as part of the major reorganization of the CF by [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] General [[Rick Hillier]]. Special operation units fall under [[Canadian Special Operations Command]].\n\n==Integration of women==\nThe Canadian Women's Army Corps was created in the Second World War as a separate corps of the Army, and remained so until the 1960s when women were integrated into the [[Canadian Forces]]. Women were restricted to certain trades, though by the 1990s were accepted into all trades. Captain [[Nichola Goddard]] was the first female combat soldier killed when she died in battle in [[Afghanistan]] in 2006.\n\nThe first 'lady cadets' graduated from [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in the 1980s.\n\n== Canadian Army flags ==\nTo help distinguish its soldiers from British forces, the flag of the Canadian Active Service Force, also known as the Battle Flag of Canada, was approved for use on December 7, 1939, as the Army's command flag. The flag was designed by Colonel A. Fortescue Duguid, Director of the Historical Section at National Defence Headquarters. The battle flag was not popular, and its use was discontinued on January 22, 1944. After the Second World War, the Canadian Army did not have its own distinctive command flag or Ensign, but simply used the Canadian National Flag as a service flag when required.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=flags-flown-by-the-canadian-army/hnps1va0 | title=Flags flown by the Canadian Army | publisher=Canadian Armed Forces / Department of National Defence | date=7 November 2013 | accessdate=24 May 2014 | author=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada}}</ref> In 1989, Force Mobile Command requested and received a command flag, which was designed in the standard command flag pattern, with the Canadian flag in the canton, and the badge in the fly.\n\nThe Union Jack was also used as the Army's service flag  (flown at various army installations) along with the Red Ensign until 1965, after which the current Canadian Flag was exclusively used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatDefence.html|title=Flags of National Defence|website=www.fraser.cc}}</ref>\n\n===Service flags===\n{|\n|[[Image:Canadian Red Ensign 1921-1957.svg|thumb|150px|The Red Ensign; service flag 1944\u20131957.]]\n|[[Image:Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|thumb|150px|Modified Red Ensign; service flag 1957\u20131965.]]\n|[[Image:Flag of Canada (Pantone).svg|thumb|150px|Canadian national flag; service flag; 1965\u2013present.]]\n|}\n\n===Canadian Army command flags===\n{|\n|[[File:Flag of the Canadian Army (1939-1944).svg|thumb|150px|The Canadian Army Battle Flag; command flag 1939\u20131944.

In this interval Shachtman and Cannon were increasingly at odds with one another, with Abern tending to follow Shachtman in matters of controversy.\n\nAbern was also a founding member of [[Workers Party of the United States]] in 1934, formed when the CLA merged with [[A.J.

In that year he and other Trotskyists entered the Socialist Party ''en masse''  as part of the so-called \"[[French Turn]]\" tactic, a brief interlude ending with their expulsion late in 1937.\n\nIn 1938, Abern helped found the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) and he was on the National Committee of that organization from 1938 until 1940. The April 1940 convention of the SWP instructed the National Committee of the party to take disciplinary action against Abern, Shachtman, [[James Burnham]], and their factional supporters if that group failed to abide by the decisions of the convention. In accordance with these instructions, the National Committee suspended Burnham, Shachtman, and Abern at its meeting of April 22, 1940, giving the members of this so-called \"[[petty-bourgeois]] opposition\" an opportunity to recant and return to the party. Burnham left the radical movement at this time, while Abern joined Max Shachtman's in establishing a new organization called the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party of the United States]] (WPUS).

In this interval Shachtman and Cannon were increasingly at odds with one another, with Abern tending to follow Shachtman in matters of controversy.\n\nAbern was also a founding member of [[Workers Party of the United States]] in 1934, formed when the CLA merged with [[A.J. Muste]]'s Workers Party. He was a member of the National Committee of that organization from 1934 to 1936. In that year he and other Trotskyists entered the Socialist Party ''en masse''  as part of the so-called \"[[French Turn]]\" tactic, a brief interlude ending with their expulsion late in 1937.\n\nIn 1938, Abern helped found the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) and he was on the National Committee of that organization from 1938 until 1940. The April 1940 convention of the SWP instructed the National Committee of the party to take disciplinary action against Abern, Shachtman, [[James Burnham]], and their factional supporters if that group failed to abide by the decisions of the convention. In accordance with these instructions, the National Committee suspended Burnham, Shachtman, and Abern at its meeting of April 22, 1940, giving the members of this so-called \"[[petty-bourgeois]] opposition\" an opportunity to recant and return to the party. Burnham left the radical movement at this time, while Abern joined Max Shachtman's in establishing a new organization called the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party of the United States]] (WPUS).

{"title_page": "History of the Cadet Instructors Cadre", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}\nThe '''Cadet Instructors Cadre''' (CIC) was founded on May 1, 1909 when the Canadian Army establishment of a \"Corps of School Cadet Instructors (Militia).\"  Previously, a Special General Order issued on December 21, 1903 had allowed qualified male school teachers be appointed as a [[Second Lieutenant]], and to be permitted to hold the rank as long as they remained an instructor and the Army Cadet Corps remained efficient. The adult leadership for the Sea, Army and Air Cadet Organizations in Canada developed quite separately from each other until 1968, when cadet instructors were consolidated in a tri-service Cadet Instructors List as a result of the integration of the Canadian Forces.  The Canadian Forces Cadet Instructors Cadre marked 100 years of service on May 1, 2009.\n\n==Before the existence of the Cadet Instructors Cadre==\n===Sea Cadets===\nIn 1902 the [[Navy League of Canada]], whose main purpose was encouraging the development of the [[Canadian Navy]], established the '''Boy's Naval Brigade'''. In the beginning, it directed the brigades itself, with its own resources, techniques and funding. Some of their members served as instructors until 1922, when the name of the program was changed to Navy League [[Sea Cadets]]. Unlike the adult leadership of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, the instructors of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets were volunteers. They wore a uniform similar to officers of the Royal Canadian Navy, but with an anchor device above the rank stripes rather than the wavy stripes of the Naval Reserve or the permanent force's executive curl. They did not receive any military training and did not hold a commission from the King. In 1941 the [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]] were established, and became associated with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. The Sea Cadets operated under the authority of the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] from then, in co-operation with the Navy League of Canada. Sea Cadet officers were warranted while they served, rather than commissioned, as were the officers of the Cadet Services of Canada that led the Army Cadet program. Promotion was based on age and length of service. Sea Cadet officers were not members of the Canadian Forces until the Canadian Forces were integrated and they were taken into the Cadet Instructors List, with the exception that time as a warranted Sea Cadet officer was credited towards the Canadian Forces Decoration.\n\n===Army Cadets===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CSofCanada(2).jpg|right|thumb|500px|The Badge of Cadet Services of Canada]] -->\nThe Army Cadet organization was created in 1879, when authorization was given to form Associations for Drill in Educational Institutions, for boys over 14 years of age. The Department of Militia provided the services of a professional instructor and the schools were required to appoint suitable teachers to lead the corps. In 1909, The Right Honourable [[Donald Alexander Smith]], the [[Lord Strathcona]], [[Canada|Canadian]] [[High Commissioner]] in [[Great Britain]], became interested in the training of cadets in Canadian schools. He founded the Strathcona Foundation and played an important role in the development of the Army Cadet organization. One of the changes instituted was the authorization of the \"Corps of School Cadet Instructors\" on May 1, 1909. The Corps was disbanded and reorganized on May 1, 1921, and on January 1, 1924 it was re-designated the [[Cadet Services of Canada]] (Non-Permanent). This corps of instructors was the fifth component of the Canadian Army and, under the National Defence Act, its members were part of the reserves. In 1928, it was defined as follows, \"Corps of the Non-Permanent Active Militia, consisting of male school teachers\". Training of an officer of the Cadet Services of Canada, compulsory for promotion, was thus similar to that of other Non-Permanent Active Militia officers. The situation remained about the same until the end of the 1960s; Army Cadet officers received training as \"Cadet Instructors\" and as \"Cadet Chief Instructors\". In addition to school teachers, members of the Cadet Services of Canada came from many different backgrounds, including former members of the Canadian military, many of whom were veterans of World War II and the Korean War.\n\n===Air Cadets===\nIt was not until the start of [[World War II]] that the Air Cadet organization was created. The [[Air Cadet League of Canada]] was founded in 1940, followed in 1941 by the first Air Cadet units. All commissioned officers of the Air Cadets and all warrant officers were adults enrolled in the league. These men were volunteers, but the local committee was allowed to pay them. They wore uniforms very similar to those of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF). Contrary to the RCAF officers, who held a commission from the King, the Air Cadet officers held a commission from the Air Cadet League of Canada, which also granted promotions. As these officers were not members of the RCAF they did not wear the standard RCAF emblems, but wore the collar badges and shoulder flashes of the Air cadets.  It was not until 1943 that the RCAF commissioned officers specifically for the air cadet program (known as the \u2018Air Cadets Corps\u2019) and provided a more proper training regime for these officers.  They wore the standard RCAF uniform and RCAF badges but wore shoulder flashes that stated \u2018A.C.C.\u2019  The officers of the A.C.C. were individuals were ineligible to serve in an active duty overseas due to age or other restrictions.\n\n==Creation of the Cadet Instructor Cadre==\nOn February 1, 1968, the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Canadian Air Force and the [[Canadian Army]] were unified into a single entity called the Canadian Armed Forces. Unification caused warranted Sea Cadet officers and Air Reserve Air Cadet Officers to be brought together with the Cadet Services of Canada into a single Cadet Instructor List (CIL). The officers, who were now responsible for all Canadian Cadets, had a single structure and were all enrolled as members of the Canadian Forces Reserve Force with the primary role of administering and supervising the Cadet Organizations. Members of the Cadet Instructors List sub-component were commissioned as officers in the [[Canadian Forces]]. The name was changed to Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC) in 1994, to provide a bilingual branch identifier.\n\n== Transition and upheaval in the Canadian Forces ==\nThe integration of the Canadian Forces in 1968 brought confusion and upheaval to the Reserve Force. From 1968 until the mid-1970s, Cadet Instructors were caught in a transitory environment. While it was not long before the country's military was wearing the new green uniform of the Canadian Forces, Cadet Instructor List officers, along with all members of the CF Reserve, continued to wear their former service uniform or acquire the Canadian Forces green uniform from surplus. In an environment where appearance and uniformity are of primary importance, dress was less than \"uniform\"; If narrow trousers were the fashion of the day, they might ask the tailor to make narrow trousers. If they were unable to find black shoes, brown shoes would have to do instead. It was not until 1975, more than seven years after unification, that reserve members of the forces were issued the new rifle green CF uniform.\n\nSea Cadets wore the new badge of the Naval Operations branch, while Air Cadet officers wore either the previous Royal Canadian Air Force (Officers') hat badge or the new Air Operations branch badge. Many Army Cadet officers wore the badge of the former Cadet Services of Canada or the army unit with which their Cadet Corps was affiliated. A new Cadet Instructors List cap badge was created in 1977. Officially issued as a tri-service style hat badge, it was later unofficially restyled to be element specific (sea, land or air). While it was generally worn it was never officially adopted.\n\nFormal training for cadet officers fell by the wayside during this period as well, leading to an ad hoc series of courses that were not compulsory. Until a new training regime was instituted, it was relatively easy to get be promoted. As was the policy for all reserve force members, former cadets and university graduates could, for example, be enrolled and promoted to the rank of second lieutenant (2Lt). A former ranking cadet and graduate of an advanced 6 week cadet course could be commissioned as a Lieutenant (Lt). Occasionally, because of lack of personnel, an Officer-Cadet about to become a [[commanding officer]] would be promoted to acting Captain. After one year, his rank would become substantive. Lack of resources undermined the credibility of Cadet Instructor Officers for several years. Today CIC Officers are accepted and recognized for their unique and special role in the Canadian Forces.\n\n==Changing Society and the Cadet Organization==\nWhile school teachers and veterans had been the dominant source of cadet instructors for several years, the veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War were reaching retirement age, leaving teachers amongst the largest group of instructors. Employment at summer training was particularly attractive since teachers were free during the school break. Post-secondary training was increasing in society and former cadets were attracted to the reserve force as a means to help pay for their studies. The Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadets was not open to girls until 1975 although the Navy League sponsored Wrenettes, the Air Cadet League sponsored Air Cadettes, and there were a few girls in school Army Cadet corps. Many of the first women officers came from the former League-sponsored Wrenettes and Air Cadettes. Others came from the general population including parents of cadets. As was the practice of the day, they were often assigned to unit administration. Today girl cadets and adult female officers perform all duties and occupy all leadership positions in the program.\n\n==Training and promotion==\nBefore the creation of the CIC, Cadet Service of Canada Officers that led Army Cadets were trained through a seven-week modified Reserve Force Infantry Officers Course during July and August. Air Cadet Squadron Officers had a similar training system. With integration, those programs ceased. In 1969, the Army Cadet program that was accustomed to sending new entries for training, established an internal training program. They conducted two-week summer courses at the [[Citadelle of Quebec|Citadelle]] in [[Quebec City]], for groups of officers from the three elements. A school for Cadet Instructors was established in Eastern Region in 1971. From 1972 on, CIL officers were required to take courses at what was first called the Cadet Instructor School, and later became the RCIS (Regional Cadet Instructor School). Passing these courses was not yet a prerequisite for promotion. During the first few years, officers of all ranks were taking part in the basic courses. Following the example of Eastern Region, other regions opened schools during the mid-1970s and, in 1976, Ottawa finally gave them official blessing by providing training programs and standards to meet. Since then, taking courses has been required for promotion. Former Officers of the Regular Force or Primary Reserve who component transfer to the Cadet Organization and Training Service maintain their commission and Non Commissioned Members may retain their rank or choose to be commissioned into the CIC Branch. Sergeants/Petty Officers Second Class are commissioned as Second Lieutenants/Acting Sub Lieutenants, former Warrant Officers/Petty Officers First Class are commissioned as Lieutenants/Sub Lieutenants and former Master Warrant Officers/Chief Petty Officers Second Class and Chief Warrant Officers/Chief Petty Officers First Class are commissioned as Captains/Lieutenants (Navy).\n\n==CIC Branch==\nIn 1987, a Cadet Instructor Branch Advisory Committee was established, providing representation in Ottawa for CIC officers. CFAO 2-10 states as follows: \"Personnel branches were created to enable members of the Canadian Forces in related occupations to identify with each other in cohesive professional groups. These groups are based on similarity of military roles, customs and traditions\".\n\nFrom 2000\u20132002, a job analysis was performed by the Directorate of Cadets to better understand the duties and responsibilities of CIC Officers.  This led to the design and development of a new course structure where training is for the position, rather than for promotion. The course content is more relevant to the role of CIC officers in the 21st century, including topics such as adolescent development, ethics and advanced instructional techniques, resulting in a more robust and up-to-date training program.  The first course, the CIC Basic Officer Training Course (BOTC) was launched in 2009. It mirrors the relative parts of all Basic Officer Training to introduce new members of the CF to the military ethos. Other courses will be introduced progressively over time.\n\nIn 2015, the CIC was directed to wear the original and authorized Tri-Service Branch Badge rather than the unofficial element specific uniform identifiers that had been the practice. Army Officers continue to wear the army specific collar badges and the CIC branch buttons, but all officers of the Branch now wear the original Tri-Service Cadet Instructor Cadre Branch cap badge.\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716202511/http://www.cadets.net/est/eric/doc/manuels_dep_guides/manuel_BOQ.pdf Basic Officer Qualification Course]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Cadet Instructors Cadre}}\n[[Category:Cadet Instructors Cadre (Canada)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}\nThe '''Cadet Instructors Cadre''' (CIC) was founded on May 1, 1909 when the Canadian Army establishment of a \"Corps of School Cadet Instructors (Militia).\"  Previously, a Special General Order issued on December 21, 1903 had allowed qualified male school teachers be appointed as a [[Second Lieutenant]], and to be permitted to hold the rank as long as they remained an instructor and the Army Cadet Corps remained efficient.

They conducted two-week summer courses at the [[Citadelle of Quebec|Citadelle]] in [[Quebec City]], for groups of officers from the three elements. A school for Cadet Instructors was established in Eastern Region in 1971. From 1972 on, CIL officers were required to take courses at what was first called the Cadet Instructor School, and later became the RCIS (Regional Cadet Instructor School). Passing these courses was not yet a prerequisite for promotion. During the first few years, officers of all ranks were taking part in the basic courses. Following the example of Eastern Region, other regions opened schools during the mid-1970s and, in 1976, Ottawa finally gave them official blessing by providing training programs and standards to meet. Since then, taking courses has been required for promotion. Former Officers of the Regular Force or Primary Reserve who component transfer to the Cadet Organization and Training Service maintain their commission and Non Commissioned Members may retain their rank or choose to be commissioned into the CIC Branch. Sergeants/Petty Officers Second Class are commissioned as Second Lieutenants/Acting Sub Lieutenants, former Warrant Officers/Petty Officers First Class are commissioned as Lieutenants/Sub Lieutenants and former Master Warrant Officers/Chief Petty Officers Second Class and Chief Warrant Officers/Chief Petty Officers First Class are commissioned as Captains/Lieutenants (Navy).\n\n==CIC Branch==\nIn 1987, a Cadet Instructor Branch Advisory Committee was established, providing representation in Ottawa for CIC officers. CFAO 2-10 states as follows: \"Personnel branches were created to enable members of the Canadian Forces in related occupations to identify with each other in cohesive professional groups. These groups are based on similarity of military roles, customs and traditions\".\n\nFrom 2000-2002, a job analysis was performed by the Directorate of Cadets to better understand the duties and responsibilities of CIC Officers.  This led to the design and development of a new course structure where training is for the position, rather than for promotion. The course content is more relevant to the role of CIC officers in the 21st century, including topics such as adolescent development, ethics and advanced instructional techniques, resulting in a more robust and up-to-date training program.  The first course, the CIC Basic Officer Training Course (BOTC) was launched in 2009. It mirrors the relative parts of all Basic Officer Training to introduce new members of the CF to the military ethos. Other courses will be introduced progressively over time.\n\nIn 2015, the CIC was directed to wear the original and authorized Tri-Service Branch Badge rather than the unofficial element specific uniform identifiers that had been the practice. Army Officers continue to wear the army specific collar badges and the CIC branch buttons, but all officers of the Branch now wear the original Tri-Service Cadet Instructor Cadre Branch cap badge.\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716202511/http://www.cadets.net/est/eric/doc/manuels_dep_guides/manuel_BOQ.pdf Basic Officer Qualification Course]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Cadet Instructors Cadre}}\n[[Category:Cadet Instructors Cadre (Canada)]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCIC Branch:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2000-2002 \u2192 2000\u20132002", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Cadet_Instructors_Cadre"}

It began in the mid-1960s with the [[Garage rock|garage]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[blues rock]] movements. Hard rock developed into a major form of [[popular music]] in the 1970s, with  bands such as  [[the Who]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Led Zeppelin]],  [[Deep Purple]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Van Halen]]. During the 1980s, some hard-rock bands moved away from their hard-rock roots and more towards [[pop rock]],<ref name=AMQueen/><ref name=Bogdanov2002Queen>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Despite this, many [[post-grunge]] bands adopted a hard rock sound, and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard-rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and [[post-punk revival]] scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like [[the White Stripes]], [[the Strokes]], [[Interpol (band)| Interpol]] and, later, [[the Black Keys]]. In the 2000s only a few hard-rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.\n<!--THERE ARE SUFFICIENT BANDS IN THE LEAD - PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY MORE WITHOUT DISCUSSION ON THE TALKPAGE.-->\n\n==Definitions==\n[[File:Backbeat chop.png|thumb|left|300px|Drum notation for a [[beat (music)#Backbeat|back beat]]<ref>D.

It began in the mid-1960s with the [[Garage rock|garage]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[blues rock]] movements. Hard rock developed into a major form of [[popular music]] in the 1970s, with  bands such as  [[the Who]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Led Zeppelin]],  [[Deep Purple]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Van Halen]]. During the 1980s, some hard-rock bands moved away from their hard-rock roots and more towards [[pop rock]],<ref name=AMQueen/><ref name=Bogdanov2002Queen>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Despite this, many [[post-grunge]] bands adopted a hard rock sound, and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard-rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and [[post-punk revival]] scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like [[the White Stripes]], [[the Strokes]], [[Interpol (band)| Interpol]] and, later on, [[the Black Keys]]. In the 2000s only a few hard-rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.\n<!--THERE ARE SUFFICIENT BANDS IN THE LEAD - PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY MORE WITHOUT DISCUSSION ON THE TALKPAGE.-->\n\n==Definitions==\n[[File:Backbeat chop.png|thumb|left|300px|Drum notation for a [[beat (music)#Backbeat|back beat]]<ref>D.

{"title_page": "History of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs", "text_new": "{{Use Australian English|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\nThe '''history of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs''' stretches from the 1930s to the present day. Based in [[Belmore, New South Wales|Belmore]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], the Bulldogs in 1935 were admitted to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales Rugby Football League]] (NSWRFL) competition, a predecessor of the current NRL competition.\n\nThe Bulldogs won their first premiership in just their fourth season (1938). At the time it made them the quickest club (barring the founding clubs) to win a premiership after admission to the competition, a record which was only recently beaten in 1999 by the [[Melbourne Storm]]. They won a second premiership in 1942 but then had to wait another 38 years before breaking through for a third title in 1980. During the 1980s, the Bulldogs were a dominant force in the competition appearing in five Grand Finals, winning four of them. In the 1990s they featured in the 1994, 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the title in 1995 over Manly. Their most recent success was in 2004 when they beat the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16\u201313, the tryscorers being [[Hazem El Masri]] and Matt Utai, and the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] winner [[Willie Mason]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Canterbury]]-[[Bankstown]] region in [[Sydney]]'s southwest had a thriving rugby league culture and local competition from 1922 onwards,<ref name=\"From\">Lester, Gary; ''From Berries to Bulldogs: Fifty Years of the Cantberury-Bankstown R.L.F.C.''; pp. 11-13 {{ISBN|9780949853066}}</ref> By 1930 the club had won the President's Cup competition<ref name=\"From\"/> and afterwards applied repeatedly to join the Sydney senior competition, finally being successful on 24 September 1934. The main barrier had been the lack of a suitable ground, which the NSWRL had set as a condition of entry. The club covered as territory the municipalities of Bankstown and Canterbury, taking them from St George and Western Suburbs. It would share the suburbs of Earlwood and Hurlstone Park with Newtown.<ref name=\"smh34\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136116132?searchTerm=%22Canterbury-Bankstown%22%20league&searchLimits=l-state=New+South+Wales|title=New First Grade League Club: Canterbury-Bankstown Elevated in Sydney |date=27 September 1934|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> It took part for the first time in 1935.\n\n==Debut season==\nCanterbury played its first premiership match against [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] on [[Anzac Day]], 25 April 1935 at [[North Sydney Oval]]. In a match refereed by Tom McMahon, North Sydney won by a margin of 20 points to 5. Scorers for Canterbury-Bankstown were a try to [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]] and a penalty goal to [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]]. Hartwell was a prop forward, whilst Carey was a halfback or five-eighth who had been a Canterbury junior before playing with St George.\n\nThe first Canterbury team was: George Main, [[Vince Dwyer]], [[Jack Morrison (rugby league)|Jack Morrison]] (c), [[Sid Elliott]], Basil Crawford, Harry Brown, [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]], [[Frank Sponberg]], [[Alan Wellington]], [[Jack McConnell (rugby league)|Jack McConnell]], [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]], [[Bob Lindfield]] and [[Fred Chaplin (rugby league)|Fred Chaplin]] and was coached by [[Tedda Courtney]].\n\nCanterbury's initial season was a remarkable one \u2013 for the wrong reasons. Playing without a home ground, the team suffered a number of massive losses, losing in successive weeks during May 6\u201391 to [[St George Dragons|St George]] and 7\u201387 to [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] \u2013 the two heaviest defeats in the history of the competition.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 Rugby League Tables: Biggest Wins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717162122/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 |date=17 July 2014 }}</ref> The club managed to avoid the wooden spoon by twice defeating the winless [[Sydney University rugby league team|University]], but still conceded 140 tries in sixteen matches or an average of 8.75 tries per game, which remains the second-highest figure in NSWRFL/NRL history behind the 9.08 tries per game conceded by University in their debut [[1920 NSWRFL season|1920 season]].<ref>[http://afltables.com/rl/teams/all/overall_sr.html Rugby League Tables: Season Records]</ref>\n\n==Early success==\nAfter the disastrous 1935 season, Canterbury became determined to achieve success and especially to improve the backline \u2013 the chief cause of the 1935 failures.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 22</ref> They bought fullback [[Tom Kirk (rugby league)|Tom Kirk]] from Tumut, centre and captain [[Alan Brady]] from Western Suburbs, threequarter [[Joe Gartner]] from Newtown and ex-Bluebag prop [[Henry Porter (rugby league)|Henry Porter]] from Goulburn. Along with champion coach [[Frank Burge]], these buys improved the Cantabs from 1935's two wins to nine in 1936, netting a place in the finals.\n\nIn 1938, the Cantabs suffered only one loss, and a first title, defeating former nemesis [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 19\u20136 in the final. Instrumental in the club's success was the front row combination of props [[Eddie Burns]] and [[Henry Porter (rugby league footballer)|Henry Porter]] and hooker [[Roy Kirkaldy]]. The club also won the reserve grade premiership the same year. Canterbury made the grand final again in 1940 but lost to Easts 24\u201314. After long their semi-final in 1942, Canterbury finished on top of the ladder with Balmain in 1942, and secured the minor premiership after the NSWRL ruled that a play-off was necessary and they beat the Tigers 40\u201320. Canterbury were defeated by St George 35\u201310 in the semis, but as minor premiers had the right to challenge in a grand final which saw them defeat the Dragons 11\u20139 in wet conditions after the scores were even at half-time.\n\n==Decline as a Power==\nRemarkably \u2013 though largely due to the influence of [[World War II]] which deprived them of stars Porter and Newham, along with [[Bob Farrar]] and [[Bob Jackson (rugby league)|Bob Jackson]]<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 42</ref> \u2013 Canterbury fell from premiers in 1942 to wooden spooners in each of the following two seasons. As players returned from service in the war, the club did regain its strength, finishing sixth in 1945, third in 1946 and on top of the table in 1947. They finished the competition three points clear of the [[Balmain Tigers]] with Newtown and Wests making up the four. They beat Newtown 25\u201315 in the first semi but lost to Balmain 19\u201325 in the final. As they had been minor premiers, they had the right of a rematch to force a Grand Final. However, Canterbury were unsuccessful, going down 9\u201313 after leading 7\u20134 at half time.\n\nTheir loss of the 1947 campaign was, more than the lapse of 1943 to 1945, the end of their first successful period. With the retirement of the famous front three of [[Eddie Burns]], [[Roy Kirkaldy]] and Henry Porter (remarkably, none ever played for [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]] owing to the war), Canterbury was unable to develop top-line players or attract established stars to its ranks, for the club's budget in this era was largely devoted to the establishment and development of their licensed club.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 49</ref> The club's financial position is the late 1950s was so precarious that only a loan from patron Stan Parry prevented the club from closing down.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 60</ref>\n\n[[Ron Willey]] was their sole Australian international between 1948 and 1962, but never played a Test match, whilst long-serving hooker [[Fred Anderson (rugby league)|Fred Anderson]] was the only Canterbury player between 1954 and 1962 to reach even State representation. Even a spell by Australian coach [[Vic Hey]] in 1955 and 1956,<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/coaches/vic-hey/summary.html Vic Hey: Coaching Summary]</ref> and the presence of other renowned mentors [[Col Geelan]] and Cec Cooper did not life the Berries up the ladder.\n\nIn 1948 they won only seven games, and after at one point looking like a surprise minor premiership in 1953 collapsed to never win more than six in a season from 1954 to 1959. Between 1952 and 1959 Canterbury were second last on five occasions (only [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] denying them the wooden spoon in four cases) but [[1960 NSWRFL season|in 1960]] under the coaching of club legend Burns they made the semis in an unparalleled ''four-way play-off''. However their finals campaign only lasted one match as they lost to [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 16\u20139 in the second semi-final. In the following seasons, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts on 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skillful fullback [[Les Johns]] gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.\n\nThe Berries' most persistent weakness during this long drought lay in attack: Canterbury did not score so many as fifty tries in any season between 1951 and 1969,<ref>AFL Tables; [http://afltables.com/rl/teams/canterbury/canterbury_ss.html Canterbury Season Summary]</ref> and between 1954 and 1961 the highest season's try tally by any individual Canterbury player was just seven by [[Rugby league positions#Five-eighth|five-eighth]] [[Ray Gartner]] in 1960.<ref>Rugby League Project; [http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/seasons.html Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons]</ref> The Berries' one potential prolific tryscorer, winger and local junior Barry Stenhouse, suffered a career-ruining leg muscle injury in 1954,<ref>'Special Treatment for Stenhouse'; ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 June 1954, p. 8</ref> a season after scoring fourteen tries and sharing a ''Sydney Morning Herald'' \"Player of the Year\" award with Keith Holman.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 53</ref>\n\n==1967: the \"intercept\" Grand Final==\nIn 1967 Canterbury were captain-coached by tough forward [[Kevin Ryan (rugby league)|Kevin Ryan]], who had joined them from St George and helped them break his former club's extraordinary run of eleven straight premierships by beating them 12\u201311 in the preliminary final after being down 9-0 early on. Prior to this, Canterbury had finished third in the regular season, three points behind [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and four behind minor premiers St George. Their semi-final campaign started well, beating Easts 13\u20132, before victory over the Dragons. They lost to Souths in the premiership decider, in a match best remembered for [[Bob McCarthy]]'s intercept try. The match had been a close one, with Souths leading 10\u20138 at half time, before Canterbury drew level for much of the second half. Souths gained the lead four minutes from full-time with an [[Eric Simms (rugby league)|Eric Simms]] goal following a penalty for an incorrect scrum feed by Canterbury half [[Ross Kidd]]. For the losers, fullback Les Johns, second-rower [[Kevin Goldspink]] and centre [[Bob Hagan (rugby league)|Bob Hagan]] all stood out.\n\n==Reformation and rebuilding years==\nThe following few years saw mixed fortunes for the club on the field, with a sudden decline in 1968 and 1969 followed by a semi-final berth in 1970 (though they immediately bowed out by losing 12\u20137 to St George) and a return to mid-table in 1971 and 1972. However, off the field the club was developing administrative strength that would restore it to the status of a \"power\" for the following thirty seasons.\n\nCanterbury made the semis again in 1973, coming fifth in the first year the competition had a final five rather than four. Though they lost to [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], this heralded better times as the club made the semis every year for the rest of the decade, apart from 1977 when the team was heavily hit by injuries.\n\n1974 proved more promising, as the club finished third on the ladder behind a runaway [[Sydney Roosters|Roosters]] outfit coached by [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], and [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]]. They then defeated both clubs \u2013 Manly 20\u201314 and Easts 19\u201317 to be the first through to the Grand Final. However, missed opportunities in an initially tight game lead to a 19\u20134 defeat. This had been the first Premiership decider Canterbury had played in since 1967.\n\n==The Entertainers==\n[[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore]] was the top administrator at the Canterbury Bulldogs from 1970 to 1995. During this time the Bulldogs climbed to the very top of the game. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Bulldogs under coach [[Ted Glossop]] who came to the club in 1978 played an exciting and skilful brand of football that got them named '''The Entertainers'''. With brilliant halfback [[Steve Mortimer]] the linchpin, the Bulldogs as they were to be named in 1978 played a brand of football that was the envy of the Sydney Premiership.\n\nThe arrival of youngster [[Steve Mortimer]] and veteran [[Bob McCarthy]] in 1976 signalled a new beginning at the Bulldogs. McCarthy only had two seasons at Canterbury but his experience, knowledge and effect left a lasting impression with a new generation of forwards coming through the ranks, which included [[Steve Folkes]], [[Graeme Hughes]] and Geoff Robinson.\n\nHints of future heroics came in 1976, Canterbury scraped into the final five, finishing fifth, then beat Easts and St George before losing to Manly 15\u201312 at the last hurdle before the Grand Final, a Bob Fulton field goal breaking hearts late in the match.\n\nThe Bulldogs started off with promise but missed the semis in 1977, losing four out of their last five regular season matches and finishing seventh. They then scraped into fifth position again for 1978, but were the first team out of the playoffs losing 22\u201315 to [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].\n\nThey came fifth for a third time in four years in 1979, with the following four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain [[George Peponis]], the Bulldogs disposed of [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]], [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of his genius. [[St. George Dragons|St George]] won the Grand Final 17\u201313 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17\u20132 at the break.\n\nThe 1980 season was a watershed year for the Bulldogs and they would win their first Premiership since 1942. Canterbury played consistent football all season to finish in a tie for top position with [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] having the superior for and against. The Bulldogs defeated [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] to make it through to the Grand Final having the week off. The Roosters were favoured to win the decider but the unheralded Bulldogs pack outmuscled the Roosters pack with [[Steve Mortimer]] doing the rest. Mortimer completely outplayed opposing half [[Kevin Hastings]] with the Bulldogs winning 18\u20134. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] scored the Bulldogs first try but the Grand Final will always be remembered for [[Steve Gearin]]'s performance where he landed six goals from six attempts and scored one of the all-time greatest tries in Grand Final history. Gearin chased through a [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]] by fullback [[Greg Brentnall]] 40 m out and caught the ball in mid-air despite the best attempts from Hastings and David Michael to prevent the try. The Grand Final was also famous for the three Mortimer and three Hughes brothers playing in the clash.\n\nAs premiers, the Bulldogs did not buy significantly in the following couple of years and paid the penalty. Crippled with injuries they fell to tenth in 1981, and in 1982 stood ninth among 14 clubs in a newly expanded competition. Despite finishing third in 1983, the gap between Parramatta and Manly and the rest of the Premiership was massive. The style of football that worked for Canterbury in 1979-80 was now outdated with the club looking in a new direction. [[Warren Ryan]] would be appointed coach and the Bulldogs would quickly go from the ''Entertainers'' to the ''Enforcers'' in very quick time.\n\n==\"Wozzaball\"==\nAt the end of 1983 the board decided to go on a major rebuilding exercise. New coach [[Warren Ryan]] was brought on board, together with a collection of new players. Some of the major signings by Ryan and Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] included 1983 Dally M Player of the Year [[Terry Lamb]] and [[Brian Battese]] from Wests, [[Queensland]] forward [[Darryl Brohman]] from Penrith, hooker [[Mark Bugden]], [[Phil Gould]] and [[Peter Kelly (rugby league)|Peter Kelly]] from [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], and prop [[Peter Tunks]] from Souths. The Bulldogs went from the \"Entertainers\" to the \"Enforcers\". Young fullback [[Mick Potter]]'s form led to him becoming 1984 Dally M Player of the Year. The Bulldogs finished the season as minor premiers four points in front of rivals St. George and Parramatta. They beat the Eels in the major semi-final 16\u20138 before marking their fiftieth season by beating them again for the 1984 Premiership. However, it did not come without controversy. Ryan would drop long serving veterans [[Garry Hughes]] and club captain [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] to reserve grade.\n\nThe Bulldogs success over the coming five seasons was achieved using a new aggressive, defensively oriented way of playing, later named by some as \"Wozzaball\". This brand of football worked with Canterbury nullifying the attacking skil of Parramatta to win the decider 6\u20134 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe Bulldogs started the next year patchily but won their last seven matches to lie third on the ladder at the end of the regular season behind minor premiers St George and Balmain. They accounted for Balmain 14\u20138 before being beaten by the Dragons 17\u20136. Then they comprehensively crushed Parramatta 26\u20130 before making it back-to-back titles when they defeated St. George 7\u20136 in the Grand Final. Led by captain [[Steve Mortimer]], the Bulldogs constantly [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]ed St. George, which forced a rule change in the catching of the ball in the in goal area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nFinishing third in the regular season behind Parramatta and a rejuvenated Souths, the Bulldogs could not follow up with a hat-trick of titles losing the 1986 Grand Final 4\u20132 to the [[Parramatta Eels|Eels]] in a classic game of football. No tries were scored as both sides tackled as their lives depended on it.\n\nRyan's era at Canterbury ended after the 1987 season when he left the club on bad terms after the Bulldogs narrowly missed the semi-finals for the first time since 1982 \u2013 despite Ryan's success from 1984 until 1986. He is the only Canterbury coach to win two Premierships and when the Bulldogs named their greatest side in 2004, no coach was named, which many believe should have been Ryan. Others believed that Ryan was simply a professional coach rather than a \"true\" Bulldog and the choice of Moore as Manager of the greatest ever side was more appropriate.\n\n[[Phil Gould]] succeeded Ryan as coach and in his first year was in charge as the Bulldogs won the 1988 Grand Final against the Ryan-coached [[Balmain Tigers]] 24\u201312, the first at the new [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. It was a great and consistent season following the disappointment in 1987. 1988 also marked the final season for Canterbury legend [[Steve Mortimer]], who stood down as captain after Round 4. Mortimer suffered a broken wrist in the second last round but was fit enough to play-off the bench in the Grand Final victory. Mortimer retired with a club record 267 first grade games next to his name and at the time the most first grade games for one individual club. Mortimer captained the club to Premiership success in 1984 and 1985 and was a member of the 1980 and 1988 triumphs. He captained [[New South Wales]] in three [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] matches, winning all of them, giving the Blues their first triumph in 1985.\n\n==Chris Anderson Era==\n{{unbalanced|date=December 2010}}\nThe \"Wozzaball\" era came to an end in 1989 when the Bulldogs struggled and Gould left the club to join [[Penrith Panthers]]. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] returned as coach for the 1990 season and cleaned out the Ryan era, building the club around another club great in [[Terry Lamb]].\n\nAnderson had left the Bulldogs in 1984 and played the remaining years of his career with [[Halifax RLFC]] where he was captain-coach. Anderson intended to return to Canterbury but his commitments with Halifax in 1987-88 meant he could not take on the coaching position until 1989. Phil Gould's success in 1988 saw Anderson take on the Under 21s position in 1989 and he was promoted to first grade, which saw Gould leave on bad terms and join the [[Penrith Panthers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nOne of Anderson's first jobs as first grade coach was appoint [[Terry Lamb]] as captain ahead of [[Paul Langmack]]. This caused some controversy at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Anderson was in the first stages of cleaning out the \"Wozzaball\" era and built his team around Lamb. [[Warren Ryan]], now coaching Western Suburbs, would snare four former Canterbury players Langmack, [[Andrew Farrar]], [[David Gillespie]] and Joe Thomas whilst [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] followed Gould to [[Penrith Panthers]] and Jason Alchin joined [[St. George Dragons]].\n\nThe Bulldogs enjoyed encouraging results in 1991 led by Lamb with support from 1991 [[Rothmans Medal]] winner [[Ewan McGrady]] and \"the Welsh Wizard\" [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] with youngsters such as [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Jarrod McCracken]], [[Dean Pay]] and [[Simon Gillies]] coming through the ranks. The Bulldogs were inconsistent in 1992 and [[Peter Bullfrog Moore]] went on a recruitment drive snaring [[Martin Bella]], [[Jim Dymock]], [[Jim Serdaris]] and [[Gary Connolly]]. Canterbury won the Minor Premiership with Lamb leading the way but they fell short in the Finals losing to [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nGoal kicking wizard [[Daryl Halligan]] joined the Bulldogs in 1994 and he booted a then club record of 270 points including the match-winning drop goal in the 1994 Major Semi-Final against [[Canberra Raiders]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. [[Darren Britt]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] emerged as leading players. Canberra were far too good on Grand Final day winning 36\u201312 with [[Mal Meninga]] enjoying a great exit from the game.\n\nCanterbury were confident heading into the 1995 season with a new home at Parramatta Stadium but the uproar of the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] caused [[Jim Dymock]], [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]], and [[Jarrod McCracken]] to announce mid-season they were to leave the club. Their form before Super League was patchy and it was to get worse with demoralising losses against Manly 26\u20130, 19th place Parramatta, Newcastle 42-0 and Auckland 29-8 putting the season in doubt. Two major turning points was the switch of the final round match against [[North Queensland Cowboys]] to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] and [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] dropping Kiwi International [[Jarrod McCracken]] to reserve grade. Anderson would later omit McCracken from the overall squad. The Bulldogs walloped the Cowboys in a club record 66\u20134 victory and laid the platform for the Finals ahead.\n\nThe Bulldogs defeated the [[St. George Dragons]] 12\u20138, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24\u201310, and the 1994 Premiers [[Canberra Raiders]] 25\u20136. The Grand Final saw them up against the ARL's pin-up club [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in an ultimate Super League-ARL match. The Bulldogs were never headed winning 17\u20134 with Lamb leading the way in an inspirational (and controversial) performance. One of the tryscorers that day for Canterbury was future club captain, [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]], who was starting in only his 3rd first grade match.\n\nThe Anderson-Lamb coach-captain era at the Bulldogs lasted six seasons and they worked on a very successful rebuilding programme. Lamb announced his retirement after the Grand Final but would play on for another year in 1996 to help the sudden loss of players due to the ARL departures. Lamb however decided not to stand for the leadership leaving it for [[Simon Gillies]]. When Gillies was injured, Lamb again opted not to be captain with [[Darren Britt]] taking control for the final nine matches. Lamb's six seasons as Canterbury captain saw the club rebuild and emerge back again as a force following the great 1980s era and Lamb in 2004 would be named captain in Canterbury's 'Greatest Ever Team'.\n\nAnother era ended following the 1995 season with the retirement of Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] after 26 years in power. Moore came into power in 1969 with the backing of captain-coach [[Kevin Ryan (rugby)|Kevin Ryan]] and brought in a complete reformation of the Bulldogs club, which saw it emerge as a competitive force in the 1970s and a [[rugby league]] powerhouse in the 1980s. Moore took on a position as [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] recruitment officer and he would retain his position on the Canterbury Leagues Club board until 1998. He was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and beat the first round but it returned in 2000 and lost his battle for life on 5 July. Moore's record at Canterbury was five Premierships and nine Grand Finals in 26 seasons.\n\n===Super League War===\nWhen the Canterbury administration saw the [[Super League war]] on the horizon they re-branded the club the \"Sydney Bulldogs\". The Bulldogs were one of the clubs most damaged by the big split in Australian rugby league and lost five key players for the [[1996 ARL season|1996 season]] with [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league footballer)|Jason Smith]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jarrod McCracken]] joining arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] and [[Brett Dallas]] linking with [[North Sydney Bears]]. The Bulldogs were a shadow of their three previous seasons in 1996 and scrambled to finish 10th in the ARL Premiership.\n\nThe [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997 season]] saw Canterbury play in the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition and was the first without club legend [[Terry Lamb]] who finally hung up the boots after 349 first grade matches. The Bulldogs finished in fifth position in the ten-team competition. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] quit the club at the end of the 1997 after a lifetime of service as a player and coach. Anderson joined the newly formed [[Melbourne Storm]] with reserve grade coach [[Steve Folkes]] taking over the head coaching position.\n\nSuper League and the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] compromised at the end of 1997 and formed the [[National Rugby League]], which saw Canterbury playing arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]], [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] once again.\n\nThe Bulldogs struggled in 1998 as the effects from the [[Super League War]] and the retirement of [[Terry Lamb]] were still being felt. [[Simon Gillies]] was replaced mid-season as captain by [[Darren Britt]] and that sparked a Bulldogs revival. Canterbury won their last four matches to scrape into ninth position as the [[National Rugby League]] that season used a \"Top 10\" Finals format.\n\nJust prior to the Finals, it was revealed that former Chief Executive [[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore|Peter Moore]] was diagnosed with cancer. The Bulldogs lifted to new levels as an inspiration to 'Bullfrog' and in the first two weeks of the Finals defeated [[St. George Dragons]] 20-12 (ultimately their last match as a stand-alone club) and [[North Sydney Bears]] 23\u201312, both victories on away soil. The followed week without [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] the Bulldogs came from 16-0 down to defeat the [[Andrew Johns]] [[Newcastle Knights]] 28\u201316 with the scores locked at 16-all at full-time.\n\nThe most famous{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} semi-final came the next week against arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] with Pay, Dymock, Smith and McCracken in their line up. The Eels led 18\u20132 with 11 minutes remaining before [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] inspired a comeback. Canterbury scored three tries in the period of seven minutes to bring it back to 18\u201316 with [[Daryl Halligan]] landing a sideline goal to level up the scores before Polla-Mounter nearly snatched a win in regular time with a heart-stopping field goal just falling under the cross-bar. The Bulldogs got a 32\u201320 victory.\n\n[[Brisbane Broncos]] won the Grand Final 38-12 (after leading 12\u201310 at half time). The [[Super League War]] was now forgotten in a short period of time as they forged into a new era under the guidance of coach [[Steve Folkes]].\n\nThe 1998 season also marked the farewell to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] as the Bulldogs home ground. The decision to leave Belmore upset many of the Bulldogs' loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Belmore was Canterbury's home for 547 matches between 1936\u201398 and they had a great record on home soil. Belmore was also the home ground for the [[Parramatta Eels]] between 1982-85 as their new stadium was being built and [[St. George Dragons]] played at Belmore in 1988. Only the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Sydney Sports Ground and [[North Sydney Oval]] have hosted more Premiership games than [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. Overall, Belmore hosted 602 Premiership games.\n\nDespite opposition from many supporters{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, Canterbury moved to [[Telstra Stadium]] for the 1999 season and finished the Premiership rounds in fifth position with confidence gained from the Finals success in 1998 and signing new recruits [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Bradley Clyde]] and [[Ricky Stuart]]. The Bulldogs were defeated in the second week of the Finals with [[Melbourne Storm]]'s [[Matt Geyer]] swooping on a Stuart kick to seal victory in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nIn 1998 the Bulldogs won the [[President's Cup (rugby league)|President's Cup]] competition.\n\n==The Salary Cap==\n{{main|2002 Bulldogs RLFC season}}\nThe Bulldogs fallout from a disappointing 2000 season saw a \"new breed\" of players coming through for 2001. The Bulldogs' outfit aged badly in 2000 with many players past their best and a massive cleanout happened with several new players on the way including [[Nigel Vagana]], [[Luke Patten]], [[Brett Howland]] and [[Darrell Trindall]]. The Bulldogs finished the Minor Premiership in second position but crashed out of the Finals. The Dally M Rookie of the Year that season was [[Braith Anasta]]. [[Mark O'Meley]] was signed up for the 2002 season as the club said farewell to captain [[Darren Britt]] and his deputy [[Craig Polla-Mounter]]. With both of those gone, [[Steve Folkes]] opted for [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] as captain ahead of the more experienced [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]].\n\nTrouble returned in a big way in 2002, with the Club being found guilty of [[salary cap]] breaches described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as \"exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature\". The club received a $500,000 fine, and was stripped of all 37 competition points; the club, who were poised to take the Minor Premiership and had won 17 consecutive matches, won the wooden spoon as a result.\n\nClub legend [[Steve Mortimer]] was brought in to save the Club, and the Bulldogs then finished one game short of the Grand Final in 2003.\n\n==Gang rape allegation==\nAt the start to the [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004 season]] a major off-field scandal allegedly involving Bulldogs players in [[Coffs Harbour]].

Former Test forward [[Bradley Clyde]] was named the new Football Manager and News Limited Executive [[Malcolm Noad]] taking over from Mortimer. The controversy was considered a major public relations nightmare for the club with significant media coverage. The [[National Rugby League|NRL]] announced that the Bulldogs would be fined $150,000, and an additional $350,000 if there were any other allegations of off-field misbehaviour before the end of the 2004 season. NRL chief executive officer David Gallop said that the fine had been imposed because during the months of media scrutiny the club had failed to behave \"in a way which protected the game's image\".<ref name=\"NRL fine\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm|title=NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident|last=Foschia|first=Liz|date=28 April 2004|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm PM - NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident]</ref> In 2006, Bulldogs chief executive Malcolm Noad said that the allegations had led to the loss of millions of dollars of sponsorship money, and to continuing negative beliefs in the community about Bulldogs players and supporters.

The Bulldogs season started slowly but they worked their way into being genuine Premiership contenders, which included big wins against the [[Sydney Roosters]], [[Penrith Panthers]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] to finish the regular season on equal standing with eventual runners-up the Roosters, however due to points differential the Bulldogs were deemed to have finished second.\n\nFinals newcomers [[North Queensland Cowboys]] upset the Bulldogs 30\u201322 in the first week of the Finals. The Bulldogs powered past the [[Melbourne Storm]] 43\u201318 in the second week of the Finals. Three tries and five goals from [[Hazem El Masri]] saw the Bulldogs topple 2003 Premiers [[Penrith Panthers]] 30\u201314 in the Preliminary Final.\n\nThe Grand Final against the [[Sydney Roosters]] was always going to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16\u201313. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much punishment and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. [[Matt Utai]] scored two tries with [[Hazem El Masri]] also scoring. [[Willie Mason]] was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner. Stand-in captain [[Andrew Ryan (rugby player)|Andrew Ryan]], who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward [[Michael Crocker]] from scoring the final seconds of the match.\n\nWarriors-bound club captain [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] missed the game due to injury sustained the week before in the semi-final victory against [[Penrith Panthers]]. Price's value and respect in the team was noticeable on Grand Final night when Ryan called up Price to hold the trophy and say a few words, whilst [[Johnathan Thurston]] gave Price his Grand Final ring.\n\nFollowing their Grand Final victory, the bulldogs traveled to England to play in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]] against [[Super League]] premiers, the [[Leeds Rhinos]]. The match was played on 4 February 2005 at [[Elland Road]] in front of 37,208 with the home team coming out winners in the end of a high-scoring match, with a final scoreline of 39\u201332.\n\n==Past decade==\nThe Bulldogs were unable to mount a serious defence of the title in [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005]] as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team at times was unable to be at full-strength. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, the club suffering heavy losses and missing the finals series.\n\nIn [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]], little was expected from the club after a lacklustre 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' impressive forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing just a game short of the Grand Final, in which they lost to eventual premiers the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008]] season was a tumultuous one for the Bulldogs. They finished at the bottom of the ladder, but the main news of the season was the controversial departure of star player [[Sonny Bill Williams]].\n\nA huge player recruitment drive saw the Bulldogs reverse their fortunes in the [[2009 NRL season]].  Canterbury finished in second place during the [[2009 NRL season|2009]] and made it all the way to the preliminary final before they were defeated by arch rivals the [[Parramatta Eels]] in front of a record non-grand final crowd of 74,549.

In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due the salary cap drama engulfing the club.\n\nThe issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach [[Des Hasler]] who signed numerous players on back ended deals.  In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap.\n\nThis resulted in [[Moses Mbye]] departing for the [[Wests Tigers]] and star recruit [[Aaron Woods]] being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior.  On 16 June 2018, Canterbury suffered a humiliating 32\u201310 loss to the [[Gold Coast Titans]] at Belmore, in the press conference coach Dean Pay said \"Physically, we just weren\u2019t good enough.

However, for the third straight season, Canterbury achieved four upset victories in a row over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]], the [[Wests Tigers]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table.

Based in [[Belmore, New South Wales|Belmore]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], the Bulldogs in 1935 were admitted to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales Rugby Football League]] (NSWRFL) competition, a predecessor of the current NRL competition.\n\nThe Bulldogs won their first premiership in just their fourth season (1938). At the time it made them the quickest club (barring the founding clubs) to win a premiership after admission to the competition, a record which was only recently beaten in 1999 by the [[Melbourne Storm]]. They won a second premiership in 1942 but then had to wait another 38 years before breaking through for a third title in 1980. During the 1980s, the Bulldogs were a dominant force in the competition appearing in five Grand Finals, winning four of them. In the 1990s they featured in the 1994, 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the title in 1995 over Manly. Their most recent success was in 2004 when they beat the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16\u201313, the tryscorers being [[Hazem El Masri]] and Matt Utai, and the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] winner [[Willie Mason]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Canterbury]]-[[Bankstown]] region in [[Sydney]]'s southwest had a thriving rugby league culture and local competition from 1922 onwards,<ref name=\"From\">Lester, Gary; ''From Berries to Bulldogs: Fifty Years of the Cantberury-Bankstown R.L.F.C.''; pp. 11-13 {{ISBN|9780949853066}}</ref> By 1930 the club had won the President's Cup competition<ref name=\"From\"/> and afterwards applied repeatedly to join the Sydney senior competition, finally being successful on 24 September 1934. The main barrier had been the lack of a suitable ground, which the NSWRL had set as a condition of entry. The club covered as territory the municipalities of Bankstown and Canterbury, taking them from St George and Western Suburbs. It would share the suburbs of Earlwood and Hurlstone Park with Newtown.<ref name=\"smh34\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136116132?searchTerm=%22Canterbury-Bankstown%22%20league&searchLimits=l-state=New+South+Wales|title=New First Grade League Club: Canterbury-Bankstown Elevated in Sydney |date=27 September 1934|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> It took part for the first time in 1935.\n\n==Debut season==\nCanterbury played its first premiership match against [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] on [[Anzac Day]], 25 April 1935 at [[North Sydney Oval]]. In a match refereed by Tom McMahon, North Sydney won by a margin of 20 points to 5. Scorers for Canterbury-Bankstown were a try to [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]] and a penalty goal to [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]]. Hartwell was a prop forward, whilst Carey was a halfback or five-eighth who had been a Canterbury junior before playing with St George.\n\nThe first Canterbury team was: George Main, [[Vince Dwyer]], [[Jack Morrison (rugby league)|Jack Morrison]] (c), [[Sid Elliott]], Basil Crawford, Harry Brown, [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]], [[Frank Sponberg]], [[Alan Wellington]], [[Jack McConnell (rugby league)|Jack McConnell]], [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]], [[Bob Lindfield]] and [[Fred Chaplin (rugby league)|Fred Chaplin]] and was coached by [[Tedda Courtney]].\n\nCanterbury's initial season was a remarkable one \u2013 for the wrong reasons. Playing without a home ground, the team suffered a number of massive losses, losing in successive weeks during May 6\u201391 to [[St George Dragons|St George]] and 7\u201387 to [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] \u2013 the two heaviest defeats in the history of the competition.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 Rugby League Tables: Biggest Wins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717162122/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 |date=17 July 2014 }}</ref> The club managed to avoid the wooden spoon by twice defeating the winless [[Sydney University rugby league team|University]], but still conceded 140 tries in sixteen matches or an average of 8.75 tries per game, which remains the second-highest figure in NSWRFL/NRL history behind the 9.08 tries per game conceded by University in their debut [[1920 NSWRFL season|1920 season]].<ref>[http://afltables.com/rl/teams/all/overall_sr.html Rugby League Tables: Season Records]</ref>\n\n==Early success==\nAfter the disastrous 1935 season, Canterbury became determined to achieve success and especially to improve the backline \u2013 the chief cause of the 1935 failures.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 22</ref> They bought fullback [[Tom Kirk (rugby league)|Tom Kirk]] from Tumut, centre and captain [[Alan Brady]] from Western Suburbs, threequarter [[Joe Gartner]] from Newtown and ex-Bluebag prop [[Henry Porter (rugby league)|Henry Porter]] from Goulburn. Along with champion coach [[Frank Burge]], these buys improved the Cantabs from 1935's two wins to nine in 1936, netting a place in the finals.\n\nIn 1938, the Cantabs suffered only one loss, and a first title, defeating former nemesis [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 19-6 in the final. Instrumental in the club's success was the front row combination of props [[Eddie Burns]] and [[Henry Porter (rugby league footballer)|Henry Porter]] and hooker [[Roy Kirkaldy]]. The club also won the reserve grade premiership the same year. Canterbury made the grand final again in 1940 but lost to Easts 24-14. After long their semi-final in 1942, Canterbury finished on top of the ladder with Balmain in 1942, and secured the minor premiership after the NSWRL ruled that a play-off was necessary and they beat the Tigers 40\u201320. Canterbury were defeated by St George 35\u201310 in the semis, but as minor premiers had the right to challenge in a grand final which saw them defeat the Dragons 11\u20139 in wet conditions after the scores were even at half-time.\n\n==Decline as a Power==\nRemarkably \u2013 though largely due to the influence of [[World War II]] which deprived them of stars Porter and Newham, along with [[Bob Farrar]] and [[Bob Jackson (rugby league)|Bob Jackson]]<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 42</ref> \u2013 Canterbury fell from premiers in 1942 to wooden spooners in each of the following two seasons. As players returned from service in the war, the club did regain its strength, finishing sixth in 1945, third in 1946 and on top of the table in 1947. They finished the competition three points clear of the [[Balmain Tigers]] with Newtown and Wests making up the four. They beat Newtown 25\u201315 in the first semi but lost to Balmain 19\u201325 in the final. As they had been minor premiers, they had the right of a rematch to force a Grand Final. However, Canterbury were unsuccessful, going down 9\u201313 after leading 7\u20134 at half time.\n\nTheir loss of the 1947 campaign was, more than the lapse of 1943 to 1945, the end of their first successful period. With the retirement of the famous front three of [[Eddie Burns]], [[Roy Kirkaldy]] and Henry Porter (remarkably, none ever played for [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]] owing to the war), Canterbury was unable to develop top-line players or attract established stars to its ranks, for the club's budget in this era was largely devoted to the establishment and development of their licensed club.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 49</ref> The club's financial position is the late 1950s was so precarious that only a loan from patron Stan Parry prevented the club from closing down.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 60</ref>\n\n[[Ron Willey]] was their sole Australian international between 1948 and 1962, but never played a Test match, whilst long-serving hooker [[Fred Anderson (rugby league)|Fred Anderson]] was the only Canterbury player between 1954 and 1962 to reach even State representation. Even a spell by Australian coach [[Vic Hey]] in 1955 and 1956,<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/coaches/vic-hey/summary.html Vic Hey: Coaching Summary]</ref> and the presence of other renowned mentors [[Col Geelan]] and Cec Cooper did not life the Berries up the ladder.\n\nIn 1948 they won only seven games, and after at one point looking like a surprise minor premiership in 1953 collapsed to never win more than six in a season from 1954 to 1959. Between 1952 and 1959 Canterbury were second last on five occasions (only [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] denying them the wooden spoon in four cases) but [[1960 NSWRFL season|in 1960]] under the coaching of club legend Burns they made the semis in an unparalleled ''four-way play-off''. However their finals campaign only lasted one match as they lost to [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 16\u20139 in the second semi-final. In the following seasons, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts on 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skillful fullback [[Les Johns]] gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.\n\nThe Berries' most persistent weakness during this long drought lay in attack: Canterbury did not score so many as fifty tries in any season between 1951 and 1969,<ref>AFL Tables; [http://afltables.com/rl/teams/canterbury/canterbury_ss.html Canterbury Season Summary]</ref> and between 1954 and 1961 the highest season's try tally by any individual Canterbury player was just seven by [[Rugby league positions#Five-eighth|five-eighth]] [[Ray Gartner]] in 1960.<ref>Rugby League Project; [http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/seasons.html Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons]</ref> The Berries' one potential prolific tryscorer, winger and local junior Barry Stenhouse, suffered a career-ruining leg muscle injury in 1954,<ref>'Special Treatment for Stenhouse'; ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 June 1954, p. 8</ref> a season after scoring fourteen tries and sharing a ''Sydney Morning Herald'' \"Player of the Year\" award with Keith Holman.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 53</ref>\n\n==1967: the \"intercept\" Grand Final==\nIn 1967 Canterbury were captain-coached by tough forward [[Kevin Ryan (rugby league)|Kevin Ryan]], who had joined them from St George and helped them break his former club's extraordinary run of eleven straight premierships by beating them 12-11 in the preliminary final after being down 9-0 early on. Prior to this, Canterbury had finished third in the regular season, three points behind [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and four behind minor premiers St George. Their semi-final campaign started well, beating Easts 13-2, before victory over the Dragons. They lost to Souths in the premiership decider, in a match best remembered for [[Bob McCarthy]]'s intercept try. The match had been a close one, with Souths leading 10-8 at half time, before Canterbury drew level for much of the second half. Souths gained the lead four minutes from full-time with an [[Eric Simms (rugby league)|Eric Simms]] goal following a penalty for an incorrect scrum feed by Canterbury half [[Ross Kidd]]. For the losers, fullback Les Johns, second-rower [[Kevin Goldspink]] and centre [[Bob Hagan (rugby league)|Bob Hagan]] all stood out.\n\n==Reformation and rebuilding years==\nThe following few years saw mixed fortunes for the club on the field, with a sudden decline in 1968 and 1969 followed by a semi-final berth in 1970 (though they immediately bowed out by losing 12\u20137 to St George) and a return to mid-table in 1971 and 1972. However, off the field the club was developing administrative strength that would restore it to the status of a \"power\" for the following thirty seasons.\n\nCanterbury made the semis again in 1973, coming fifth in the first year the competition had a final five rather than four. Though they lost to [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], this heralded better times as the club made the semis every year for the rest of the decade, apart from 1977 when the team was heavily hit by injuries.\n\n1974 proved more promising, as the club finished third on the ladder behind a runaway [[Sydney Roosters|Roosters]] outfit coached by [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], and [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]]. They then defeated both clubs \u2013 Manly 20\u201314 and Easts 19\u201317 to be the first through to the Grand Final. However, missed opportunities in an initially tight game lead to a 19\u20134 defeat. This had been the first Premiership decider Canterbury had played in since 1967.\n\n==The Entertainers==\n[[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore]] was the top administrator at the Canterbury Bulldogs from 1970 to 1995. During this time the Bulldogs climbed to the very top of the game. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Bulldogs under coach [[Ted Glossop]] who came to the club in 1978 played an exciting and skilful brand of football that got them named '''The Entertainers'''. With brilliant halfback [[Steve Mortimer]] the linchpin, the Bulldogs as they were to be named in 1978 played a brand of football that was the envy of the Sydney Premiership.\n\nThe arrival of youngster [[Steve Mortimer]] and veteran [[Bob McCarthy]] in 1976 signalled a new beginning at the Bulldogs. McCarthy only had two seasons at Canterbury but his experience, knowledge and effect left a lasting impression with a new generation of forwards coming through the ranks, which included [[Steve Folkes]], [[Graeme Hughes]] and Geoff Robinson.\n\nHints of future heroics came in 1976, Canterbury scraped into the final five, finishing fifth, then beat Easts and St George before losing to Manly 15-12 at the last hurdle before the Grand Final, a Bob Fulton field goal breaking hearts late in the match.\n\nThe Bulldogs started off with promise but missed the semis in 1977, losing four out of their last five regular season matches and finishing seventh. They then scraped into fifth position again for 1978, but were the first team out of the playoffs losing 22-15 to [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].\n\nThey came fifth for a third time in four years in 1979, with the following four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain [[George Peponis]], the Bulldogs disposed of [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]], [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of his genius. [[St. George Dragons|St George]] won the Grand Final 17-13 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17-2 at the break.\n\nThe 1980 season was a watershed year for the Bulldogs and they would win their first Premiership since 1942. Canterbury played consistent football all season to finish in a tie for top position with [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] having the superior for and against. The Bulldogs defeated [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] to make it through to the Grand Final having the week off. The Roosters were favoured to win the decider but the unheralded Bulldogs pack outmuscled the Roosters pack with [[Steve Mortimer]] doing the rest. Mortimer completely outplayed opposing half [[Kevin Hastings]] with the Bulldogs winning 18-4. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] scored the Bulldogs first try but the Grand Final will always be remembered for [[Steve Gearin]]'s performance where he landed six goals from six attempts and scored one of the all-time greatest tries in Grand Final history. Gearin chased through a [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]] by fullback [[Greg Brentnall]] 40 m out and caught the ball in mid-air despite the best attempts from Hastings and David Michael to prevent the try. The Grand Final was also famous for the three Mortimer and three Hughes brothers playing in the clash.\n\nAs premiers, the Bulldogs did not buy significantly in the following couple of years and paid the penalty. Crippled with injuries they fell to tenth in 1981, and in 1982 stood ninth among 14 clubs in a newly expanded competition. Despite finishing third in 1983, the gap between Parramatta and Manly and the rest of the Premiership was massive. The style of football that worked for Canterbury in 1979-80 was now outdated with the club looking in a new direction. [[Warren Ryan]] would be appointed coach and the Bulldogs would quickly go from the ''Entertainers'' to the ''Enforcers'' in very quick time.\n\n==\"Wozzaball\"==\nAt the end of 1983 the board decided to go on a major rebuilding exercise. New coach [[Warren Ryan]] was brought on board, together with a collection of new players. Some of the major signings by Ryan and Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] included 1983 Dally M Player of the Year [[Terry Lamb]] and [[Brian Battese]] from Wests, [[Queensland]] forward [[Darryl Brohman]] from Penrith, hooker [[Mark Bugden]], [[Phil Gould]] and [[Peter Kelly (rugby league)|Peter Kelly]] from [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], and prop [[Peter Tunks]] from Souths. The Bulldogs went from the \"Entertainers\" to the \"Enforcers\". Young fullback [[Mick Potter]]'s form led to him becoming 1984 Dally M Player of the Year. The Bulldogs finished the season as minor premiers four points in front of rivals St. George and Parramatta. They beat the Eels in the major semi-final 16\u20138 before marking their fiftieth season by beating them again for the 1984 Premiership. However, it did not come without controversy. Ryan would drop long serving veterans [[Garry Hughes]] and club captain [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] to reserve grade.\n\nThe Bulldogs success over the coming five seasons was achieved using a new aggressive, defensively oriented way of playing, later named by some as \"Wozzaball\". This brand of football worked with Canterbury nullifying the attacking skil of Parramatta to win the decider 6\u20134 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe Bulldogs started the next year patchily but won their last seven matches to lie third on the ladder at the end of the regular season behind minor premiers St George and Balmain. They accounted for Balmain 14\u20138 before being beaten by the Dragons 17\u20136. Then they comprehensively crushed Parramatta 26\u20130 before making it back-to-back titles when they defeated St. George 7\u20136 in the Grand Final. Led by captain [[Steve Mortimer]], the Bulldogs constantly [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]ed St. George, which forced a rule change in the catching of the ball in the in goal area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nFinishing third in the regular season behind Parramatta and a rejuvenated Souths, the Bulldogs could not follow up with a hat-trick of titles losing the 1986 Grand Final 4\u20132 to the [[Parramatta Eels|Eels]] in a classic game of football. No tries were scored as both sides tackled as their lives depended on it.\n\nRyan's era at Canterbury ended after the 1987 season when he left the club on bad terms after the Bulldogs narrowly missed the semi-finals for the first time since 1982 \u2013 despite Ryan's success from 1984 until 1986. He is the only Canterbury coach to win two Premierships and when the Bulldogs named their greatest side in 2004, no coach was named, which many believe should have been Ryan. Others believed that Ryan was simply a professional coach rather than a \"true\" Bulldog and the choice of Moore as Manager of the greatest ever side was more appropriate.\n\n[[Phil Gould]] succeeded Ryan as coach and in his first year was in charge as the Bulldogs won the 1988 Grand Final against the Ryan-coached [[Balmain Tigers]] 24\u201312, the first at the new [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. It was a great and consistent season following the disappointment in 1987. 1988 also marked the final season for Canterbury legend [[Steve Mortimer]], who stood down as captain after Round 4. Mortimer suffered a broken wrist in the second last round but was fit enough to play-off the bench in the Grand Final victory. Mortimer retired with a club record 267 first grade games next to his name and at the time the most first grade games for one individual club. Mortimer captained the club to Premiership success in 1984 and 1985 and was a member of the 1980 and 1988 triumphs. He captained [[New South Wales]] in three [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] matches, winning all of them, giving the Blues their first triumph in 1985.\n\n==Chris Anderson Era==\n{{unbalanced|date=December 2010}}\nThe \"Wozzaball\" era came to an end in 1989 when the Bulldogs struggled and Gould left the club to join [[Penrith Panthers]]. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] returned as coach for the 1990 season and cleaned out the Ryan era, building the club around another club great in [[Terry Lamb]].\n\nAnderson had left the Bulldogs in 1984 and played the remaining years of his career with [[Halifax RLFC]] where he was captain-coach. Anderson intended to return to Canterbury but his commitments with Halifax in 1987-88 meant he could not take on the coaching position until 1989. Phil Gould's success in 1988 saw Anderson take on the Under 21s position in 1989 and he was promoted to first grade, which saw Gould leave on bad terms and join the [[Penrith Panthers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nOne of Anderson's first jobs as first grade coach was appoint [[Terry Lamb]] as captain ahead of [[Paul Langmack]]. This caused some controversy at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Anderson was in the first stages of cleaning out the \"Wozzaball\" era and built his team around Lamb. [[Warren Ryan]], now coaching Western Suburbs, would snare four former Canterbury players Langmack, [[Andrew Farrar]], [[David Gillespie]] and Joe Thomas whilst [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] followed Gould to [[Penrith Panthers]] and Jason Alchin joined [[St. George Dragons]].\n\nThe Bulldogs enjoyed encouraging results in 1991 led by Lamb with support from 1991 [[Rothmans Medal]] winner [[Ewan McGrady]] and \"the Welsh Wizard\" [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] with youngsters such as [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Jarrod McCracken]], [[Dean Pay]] and [[Simon Gillies]] coming through the ranks. The Bulldogs were inconsistent in 1992 and [[Peter Bullfrog Moore]] went on a recruitment drive snaring [[Martin Bella]], [[Jim Dymock]], [[Jim Serdaris]] and [[Gary Connolly]]. Canterbury won the Minor Premiership with Lamb leading the way but they fell short in the Finals losing to [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nGoal kicking wizard [[Daryl Halligan]] joined the Bulldogs in 1994 and he booted a then club record of 270 points including the match-winning drop goal in the 1994 Major Semi-Final against [[Canberra Raiders]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. [[Darren Britt]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] emerged as leading players. Canberra were far too good on Grand Final day winning 36-12 with [[Mal Meninga]] enjoying a great exit from the game.\n\nCanterbury were confident heading into the 1995 season with a new home at Parramatta Stadium but the uproar of the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] caused [[Jim Dymock]], [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]], and [[Jarrod McCracken]] to announce mid-season they were to leave the club. Their form before Super League was patchy and it was to get worse with demoralising losses against Manly 26-0, 19th place Parramatta, Newcastle 42-0 and Auckland 29-8 putting the season in doubt. Two major turning points was the switch of the final round match against [[North Queensland Cowboys]] to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] and [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] dropping Kiwi International [[Jarrod McCracken]] to reserve grade. Anderson would later omit McCracken from the overall squad. The Bulldogs walloped the Cowboys in a club record 66-4 victory and laid the platform for the Finals ahead.\n\nThe Bulldogs defeated the [[St. George Dragons]] 12-8, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24-10, and the 1994 Premiers [[Canberra Raiders]] 25-6. The Grand Final saw them up against the ARL's pin-up club [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in an ultimate Super League-ARL match. The Bulldogs were never headed winning 17-4 with Lamb leading the way in an inspirational (and controversial) performance. One of the tryscorers that day for Canterbury was future club captain, [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]], who was starting in only his 3rd first grade match.\n\nThe Anderson-Lamb coach-captain era at the Bulldogs lasted six seasons and they worked on a very successful rebuilding programme. Lamb announced his retirement after the Grand Final but would play on for another year in 1996 to help the sudden loss of players due to the ARL departures. Lamb however decided not to stand for the leadership leaving it for [[Simon Gillies]]. When Gillies was injured, Lamb again opted not to be captain with [[Darren Britt]] taking control for the final nine matches. Lamb's six seasons as Canterbury captain saw the club rebuild and emerge back again as a force following the great 1980s era and Lamb in 2004 would be named captain in Canterbury's 'Greatest Ever Team'.\n\nAnother era ended following the 1995 season with the retirement of Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] after 26 years in power. Moore came into power in 1969 with the backing of captain-coach [[Kevin Ryan (rugby)|Kevin Ryan]] and brought in a complete reformation of the Bulldogs club, which saw it emerge as a competitive force in the 1970s and a [[rugby league]] powerhouse in the 1980s. Moore took on a position as [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] recruitment officer and he would retain his position on the Canterbury Leagues Club board until 1998. He was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and beat the first round but it returned in 2000 and lost his battle for life on 5 July. Moore's record at Canterbury was five Premierships and nine Grand Finals in 26 seasons.\n\n===Super League War===\nWhen the Canterbury administration saw the [[Super League war]] on the horizon they re-branded the club the \"Sydney Bulldogs\". The Bulldogs were one of the clubs most damaged by the big split in Australian rugby league and lost five key players for the [[1996 ARL season|1996 season]] with [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league footballer)|Jason Smith]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jarrod McCracken]] joining arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] and [[Brett Dallas]] linking with [[North Sydney Bears]]. The Bulldogs were a shadow of their three previous seasons in 1996 and scrambled to finish 10th in the ARL Premiership.\n\nThe [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997 season]] saw Canterbury play in the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition and was the first without club legend [[Terry Lamb]] who finally hung up the boots after 349 first grade matches. The Bulldogs finished in fifth position in the ten-team competition. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] quit the club at the end of the 1997 after a lifetime of service as a player and coach. Anderson joined the newly formed [[Melbourne Storm]] with reserve grade coach [[Steve Folkes]] taking over the head coaching position.\n\nSuper League and the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] compromised at the end of 1997 and formed the [[National Rugby League]], which saw Canterbury playing arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]], [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] once again.\n\nThe Bulldogs struggled in 1998 as the effects from the [[Super League War]] and the retirement of [[Terry Lamb]] were still being felt. [[Simon Gillies]] was replaced mid-season as captain by [[Darren Britt]] and that sparked a Bulldogs revival. Canterbury won their last four matches to scrape into ninth position as the [[National Rugby League]] that season used a \"Top 10\" Finals format.\n\nJust prior to the Finals, it was revealed that former Chief Executive [[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore|Peter Moore]] was diagnosed with cancer. The Bulldogs lifted to new levels as an inspiration to 'Bullfrog' and in the first two weeks of the Finals defeated [[St. George Dragons]] 20-12 (ultimately their last match as a stand-alone club) and [[North Sydney Bears]] 23-12, both victories on away soil. The followed week without [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] the Bulldogs came from 16-0 down to defeat the [[Andrew Johns]] [[Newcastle Knights]] 28-16 with the scores locked at 16-all at full-time.\n\nThe most famous{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} semi-final came the next week against arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] with Pay, Dymock, Smith and McCracken in their line up. The Eels led 18-2 with 11 minutes remaining before [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] inspired a comeback. Canterbury scored three tries in the period of seven minutes to bring it back to 18-16 with [[Daryl Halligan]] landing a sideline goal to level up the scores before Polla-Mounter nearly snatched a win in regular time with a heart-stopping field goal just falling under the cross-bar. The Bulldogs got a 32-20 victory.\n\n[[Brisbane Broncos]] won the Grand Final 38-12 (after leading 12-10 at half time). The [[Super League War]] was now forgotten in a short period of time as they forged into a new era under the guidance of coach [[Steve Folkes]].\n\nThe 1998 season also marked the farewell to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] as the Bulldogs home ground. The decision to leave Belmore upset many of the Bulldogs' loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Belmore was Canterbury's home for 547 matches between 1936\u201398 and they had a great record on home soil. Belmore was also the home ground for the [[Parramatta Eels]] between 1982-85 as their new stadium was being built and [[St. George Dragons]] played at Belmore in 1988. Only the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Sydney Sports Ground and [[North Sydney Oval]] have hosted more Premiership games than [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. Overall, Belmore hosted 602 Premiership games.\n\nDespite opposition from many supporters{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, Canterbury moved to [[Telstra Stadium]] for the 1999 season and finished the Premiership rounds in fifth position with confidence gained from the Finals success in 1998 and signing new recruits [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Bradley Clyde]] and [[Ricky Stuart]]. The Bulldogs were defeated in the second week of the Finals with [[Melbourne Storm]]'s [[Matt Geyer]] swooping on a Stuart kick to seal victory in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nIn 1998 the Bulldogs won the [[President's Cup (rugby league)|President's Cup]] competition.\n\n==The Salary Cap==\n{{main|2002 Bulldogs RLFC season}}\nThe Bulldogs fallout from a disappointing 2000 season saw a \"new breed\" of players coming through for 2001. The Bulldogs' outfit aged badly in 2000 with many players past their best and a massive cleanout happened with several new players on the way including [[Nigel Vagana]], [[Luke Patten]], [[Brett Howland]] and [[Darrell Trindall]]. The Bulldogs finished the Minor Premiership in second position but crashed out of the Finals. The Dally M Rookie of the Year that season was [[Braith Anasta]]. [[Mark O'Meley]] was signed up for the 2002 season as the club said farewell to captain [[Darren Britt]] and his deputy [[Craig Polla-Mounter]]. With both of those gone, [[Steve Folkes]] opted for [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] as captain ahead of the more experienced [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]].\n\nTrouble returned in a big way in 2002, with the Club being found guilty of [[salary cap]] breaches described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as \"exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature\". The club received a $500,000 fine, and was stripped of all 37 competition points; the club, who were poised to take the Minor Premiership and had won 17 consecutive matches, won the wooden spoon as a result.\n\nClub legend [[Steve Mortimer]] was brought in to save the Club, and the Bulldogs then finished one game short of the Grand Final in 2003.\n\n==Gang rape allegation==\nAt the start to the [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004 season]] a major off-field scandal allegedly involving Bulldogs players in [[Coffs Harbour]].

The [[National Rugby League|NRL]] announced that the Bulldogs would be fined $150,000, and an additional $350,000 if there were any other allegations of off-field misbehaviour before the end of the 2004 season. NRL chief executive officer David Gallop said that the fine had been imposed because during the months of media scrutiny the club had failed to behave \"in a way which protected the game's image\".<ref name=\"NRL fine\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm|title=NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident|last=Foschia|first=Liz|date=28 April 2004|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm PM - NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident]</ref> In 2006, Bulldogs chief executive Malcolm Noad said that the allegations had led to the loss of millions of dollars of sponsorship money, and to continuing negative beliefs in the community about Bulldogs players and supporters.

The Bulldogs season started slowly but they worked their way into being genuine Premiership contenders, which included big wins against the [[Sydney Roosters]], [[Penrith Panthers]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] to finish the regular season on equal standing with eventual runners-up the Roosters, however due to points differential the Bulldogs were deemed to have finished second.\n\nFinals newcomers [[North Queensland Cowboys]] upset the Bulldogs 30-22 in the first week of the Finals. The Bulldogs powered past the [[Melbourne Storm]] 43-18 in the second week of the Finals. Three tries and five goals from [[Hazem El Masri]] saw the Bulldogs topple 2003 Premiers [[Penrith Panthers]] 30-14 in the Preliminary Final.\n\nThe Grand Final against the [[Sydney Roosters]] was always going to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16-13. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much punishment and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs.

Price's value and respect in the team was noticeable on Grand Final night when Ryan called up Price to hold the trophy and say a few words, whilst [[Johnathan Thurston]] gave Price his Grand Final ring.\n\nFollowing their Grand Final victory, the bulldogs traveled to England to play in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]] against [[Super League]] premiers, the [[Leeds Rhinos]]. The match was played on 4 February 2005 at [[Elland Road]] in front of 37,208 with the home team coming out winners in the end of a high-scoring match, with a final scoreline of 39-32.\n\n==Past decade==\nThe Bulldogs were unable to mount a serious defence of the title in [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005]] as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team at times was unable to be at full-strength. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, the club suffering heavy losses and missing the finals series.\n\nIn [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]], little was expected from the club after a lacklustre 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' impressive forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing just a game short of the Grand Final, in which they lost to eventual premiers the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008]] season was a tumultuous one for the Bulldogs. They finished at the bottom of the ladder, but the main news of the season was the controversial departure of star player [[Sonny Bill Williams]].\n\nA huge player recruitment drive saw the Bulldogs reverse their fortunes in the [[2009 NRL season]].  Canterbury finished in second place during the [[2009 NRL season|2009]] and made it all the way to the preliminary final before they were defeated by arch rivals the [[Parramatta Eels]] in front of a record non-grand final crowd of 74,549.  Canterbury had gone into the game as favourites despite Parramatta's dream run at the back end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-09-25/eels-thunder-into-grand-final/1443034/|title=Eels thunder into grand final|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Thompson (swimming coach)|Alan Thompson]], a long-time supporter of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, was appointed general manager of the club's football operations on 15 April 2010.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = AFP\n  | title = Swimming coach switches to rugby league\n  | work = Times Live\n  | publisher = AVUSA, Inc.\n  | date = 15 April 2010\n  | url = http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/other/article404879.ece/Swimming-coach-switches-to-rugby-league\n  | accessdate = 15 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Canterbury-Bankstown finished first on the competition ladder to take out their first minor premiership since 1994.

In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due the salary cap drama engulfing the club.\n\nThe issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach [[Des Hasler]] who signed numerous players on back ended deals.  In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap.\n\nThis resulted in [[Moses Mbye]] departing for the [[Wests Tigers]] and star recruit [[Aaron Woods]] being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior.

Due to the bad start to the season, there were rumours that coach [[Dean Pay]] would be relieved of his duties but he was then granted a 12-month contract extension to remain as Canterbury coach until the end of 2020.\n\nBy the midway part of the [[2019 NRL season]], Canterbury-Bankstown found themselves sitting last on the table and in real danger of finishing with the wooden spoon.  However, for the third straight season, Canterbury achieved four upset victories in a row over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]], the [[Wests Tigers]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table.

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment.\n\n==== Pawning counter ====\nThe counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security.

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

{"title_page": "History of the British salt tax in India", "text_new": "{{short description|Indian tax}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n'''Taxation of salt''' has occurred in India since the earliest times. However, this [[tax]] was greatly increased when the [[British East India Company]] began to establish its rule over provinces in India. In 1835, special taxes were imposed on Indian [[salt]] to facilitate its import. This paid huge dividends for the [[trade]]rs of the British East India Company. When the Crown took over the administration of India from the Company in 1858, the taxes were not replaced.\n\nThe stringent salt taxes imposed by the British were vehemently condemned by the Indian public. In 1885, at the first session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[Bombay]], a prominent Congress Leader, S.A.Swaminatha Iyer raised the issue of the salt tax.<ref name=\"Salt_history\" /> There were further protests throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries culminating in [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[Salt Satyagraha]] in 1930. This sathyagraha was followed by other sathyagrahas in other parts of the country.\n\nAfter the arrest of Gandhi, [[Sarojini Naidu]] led the sathyagrahis to [[Dharasana Satyagraha|Dharasana Salt works]] in [[Gujarat]] and was arrested by the police officers. [[C. Rajagopalachari]] broke the Salt Laws at [[Vedaranyam]], in Madras Province in the same year. Thousands courted arrest and were imprisoned in large numbers. The administration eventually relented and invited Mahatma Gandhi to England to attend the Second Round Table Conference. Gandhi's Dandi March got wide news coverage and proved to be a turning point in the history of [[Indian independence movement|India's independence movement]].\n\nThe salt tax, however, continued to remain in effect and was repealed only when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] became the prime minister of the interim government in 1946, but later re-introduced via the Salt Cess Act, 1953.<ref name=ssa1953 />\n\n==Taxation of salt==\nSalt taxation originated in ancient China. ''[[Guanzi]]'', a book written in around 300 BC recommends taxation of salt and propounds different methods for this purpose.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/the%20story%20of%20Salt.htm|title=The Story of Salt|accessdate=2008-05-09|author=Mohinder Singh}}</ref> The recommendations of ''Guanzi'' became the official salt policy of early Chinese Emperors. At one point of time, salt taxes constituted over one-half of China's revenues and contributed to the construction of the [[Great Wall of China]].\n\nSalt was also important in the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. The first of the great [[Roman road]]s, the ''[[Via Salaria]]'', or Salt Road, was built for transporting salt.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> However, unlike the Chinese, Romans did not monopolize salt.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" />\n\nIn Britain, there are references to salt taxes in the [[Domesday Book]] but they had died out before patents were given in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] times. Reintroduced in 1641 in the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period there was such outcry that they were withdrawn on the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and not reinstated till 1693 under [[William III of England|William III]], with duty set at two shillings a bushel on foreign salt, one shilling on native salt with exemption for [[Salted fish|fishery salt]]. In 1696 the tax was doubled and remained in force till abolished in 1825. There were probably 600 full-time officials employed in the collection of the taxes.<ref>\n{{Citation|title=The Salt Tax|author=Mary Rochester|publisher=A Salt Museum Publication, Cheshire Libraries and Museums|ISSN=0263-5593}}\n</ref>\n\n==Taxation of salt in India==\n\n===Salt-producing areas in India===\nSalt has been produced all along the [[Rann of Kutch]] on the west coast of India for the past 5,000 years.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> The Rann of Kutch is an extensive marshland that is cut off from the rest of the Indian subcontinent during monsoons when the seas inundate the low-lying areas. However, when the seawater evaporates during summer, it leaves behind a crust of salt which accumulates as salt pans.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> This salt is collected by laborers called ''malangas''.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" />\n\nOn the east coast, salt could be obtained extensively along the coast of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> The salt produced by the salt pans called ''khalaris'' in Oriya is of the finest quality in all India.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> There has always been a demand for Orissa salt in [[Bengal]].<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> When the British took over the administration of Bengal, they too felt its need and traded for salt. Gradually they monopolized Orissa salt all over Bengal.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> To check smuggling and illegal transportation, they sent armies into Orissa, resulting in the conquest of Orissa in 1803.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" />\n\n===Taxation of salt before British rule===\nSalt is a commodity that had been taxed in India ever since the time of the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryas]]. Taxes on salt have been prevalent even during the time of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. The ''Arthashastra'', which describes the different duties of the people, says that a special officer called ''lavananadhyaksa'' was appointed to collect the salt tax. Taxes were also imposed on imported salt. However, they accounted for 25 percent of the total value of the salt.<ref name=\"salt1\">{{Cite web|url=http://iref.homestead.com/files/Salt.htm|title=The Salt Tax, Excerpted from The Great Hedge of India by Roy Moxham, Harper Collins, India 2001|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref>\n\nIn Bengal, there was a salt tax in vogue during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]], which was 5% for [[Hindus]] and 2.5% for [[Muslims]].<ref name=\"salt1\" />\n\n===Taxation of salt by the British East India Company===\nIn 1759, two years after its victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]], the British East India Company came into possession of land near [[Calcutta]] where there were salt works.<ref name=\"salt1\" /> Utilizing this opportunity to make money, they doubled the land rent and imposed transit charges on the transportation of salt.<ref name=\"salt1\" />\n\nIn 1764, following the victory at the [[Battle of Buxar]], the British began to control all the revenues of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. [[Robert Clive]], who returned as [[governor-general]] in 1765, made the sale of [[tobacco]], [[betel nut]], and salt (apart from other accessories and essential [[spices]] and [[condiments]]), the [[monopoly]] of the senior officers of the British East India Company. Contracts were given to deliver salt to depots,<ref name=\"salt1\" /> and merchants were required to buy from these depots.<ref name=\"salt1\" />\n\nThe outrage was expressed by the authorities in England who declared:\n\n{{quote|We consider it too disgraceful, and below the dignity of the present situation, to allow such a monopoly.}}\n\nClive responded by offering the company {{formatnum:1200000}} per annum from the profits made.\n\nHowever, the authorities in England were stubborn, and due to the pressure they exerted, the monopoly of tobacco and betel nut was stopped on 1 September 1767, followed by the annulment of the salt monopoly on 7 October 1768.\n\nIn 1772, the governor-general, [[Warren Hastings]], brought the salt trade once again under the  company's control. The salt works were leased out to farmers who agreed to deliver salt at a fixed rate to the company and sold the leases to the highest bidders. Corruption dealt a severe blow to the company and the revenue from salt trade fell to 80,000 [[rupee]]s by 1780. This, along with the exploitation of the ''malangas'' or salt workers by their landlords, forced Hastings to introduce a new system for controlling the salt trade in India.\n\nIn 1780 Hastings brought the salt trade once again under government control, dividing the infrastructure into agencies, each under the control of an agent and governed by a controller. This system persisted, with minor modifications, until India's independence in 1947. Under this new system, the ''malangas'' sold the salt to the agents at a particular price, initially fixed at 2 rupees a ''[[maund]]'' with a tax of 1.1 to 1.5 rupees a '' maund''. This new system was a success, and in 1781\u201382, the salt revenue was 2,960,130 rupees. The company received salt revenue of 6,257,750 rupees in 1784\u201385.\n\nFrom 1788 onwards, the company began selling salt [[wholesalers]] by auction. As a result, the British East India Company increased the tax to 3.25 rupees a ''maund'', and the wholesale price of salt increased from 1.25 to about 4 rupees a ''maund''. This was an exorbitant rate that few could afford.\n\nIn 1804, the British monopolized salt in the newly conquered state of Orissa. In return, they advanced money to the ''malangas'' against future salt production, resulting in the ''malangas'' becoming debtors to the British, virtually becoming economic slaves. The Orissa ''[[zamindars]]'', who had earlier controlled the local salt trade, were alarmed at the sudden loss of income and tried to persuade the ''malanga'' not to work for the British, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early 19th century, to make the salt tax more profitable and reduce smuggling, the East India Company established customs checkpoints throughout Bengal. G. H. Smith established a \"customs line\", which was the boundary across which salt transportation involved payment of high customs duties. In the 1840s a [[Great Hedge of India|thorn fence was erected along the western frontiers of Bengal province]] to prevent salt smuggling. Eventually, after 1857, the thorn fence grew to be 2,500 miles long.\n\n{{quote|A customs line was established, which stretched across the whole of India, which in 1869 extended from the Indus to the Mahanadi in Madras, a distance of 2,300 miles; and it was guarded by nearly 12,000 men and petty officers... it consisted principally of an immense impenetrable hedge of thorny trees and bushes, supplemented by stone wall and ditches, across which no human being or beast of burden or vehicle could pass without being subject to detention or search.|(Strachey and Strachey 1882, 219-20)}}\n\n===Taxation of salt by the British authorities===\nThe taxation laws introduced by the British East India Company were in vogue during the ninety years of [[British Raj]] which followed the demise of the company. The construction of a fence to prevent smuggling of salt, which was commenced during the company's rule, was completed during this period. Sources indicate that by 1858, [[British India]] derived 10% of its revenues from its monopoly of salt.<ref name=\"india_history\">{{cite book | title=A History of India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V73N8js5ZgAC&pg=PT290&dq=british+salt+tax&as_brr=3&sig=gScw3czHTkytpPkAr9UlGIycTF4#PPT290,M1| last=Kulke| first=Hermann|author2=Dietmar Rothermund| year=2004| pages=290}}</ref> However, by the end of the century, the tax on salt had been considerably reduced.<ref name=\"india_history\" /> In 1880, income from salt amounted to 7 million [[pound sterling|pounds]].<ref name=\"hind swaraj\">{{cite book | title=Hind Swaraj and Other Writings | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc47gUOPZfcC&pg=PA20&dq=british+salt+tax&as_brr=3&sig=Jpvh3FITF2Z6lwDF5okHaVRCACA| last=Gandhi|author2=Anthony Parel| year=1997| pages=20| publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\nIn 1900 and 1905, India was one of the largest producers of salt in the world, with a yield of 1,021,426 metric tons and 1,212,600 metric tonnes respectively.\n\nIn 1923, under the viceroyalty of [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading]], a bill was passed doubling the salt tax.

It recommended that Indian salt should be taxed to enable the sale of imported English salt. Consequently, salt was imported from [[Liverpool]], resulting in an increase in salt rates. Subsequently, the government set up a monopoly on the manufacture of salt by the Salt Act. Production of salt was made an offense punishable with six months' imprisonment. The committee also recommended that Indian salt be sold in ''maunds'' of 100. However, they were sold in much lesser quantities.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1888, the salt tax was enhanced by [[Lord Dufferin]] as a temporary measure.<ref name=Naidu>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PbZPP8g4uLkC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=1888,+the+salt+tax+was+enhanced+by+Lord+Dufferin+as+a+temporary&source=bl&ots=vnxDBgJo06&sig=ACfU3U1Uf3KtEX-5yepq28p2tcG0WHT1Vg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGg9Cb2qjkAhWQYcAKHZWNCnwQ6AEwC3oECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=1888,%20the%20salt%20tax%20was%20enhanced%20by%20Lord%20Dufferin%20as%20a%20temporary&f=false|title=Nationalism in South India, Its Economic and Social Background, 1885-1918: A Study of the Madras Government's Policies in the Economic and Social Aspects and Their Impact on Nationalism in the Former Madras Presidency|last=Naidu|first=Ch M.|date=1988|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170990437|language=en}}</ref> [[Cheshire]] salt imported from the United Kingdom was available at a much cheaper rate.

Both production, as well as possession of salt, were made unlawful by this policy. The salt tax, which was one rupee and thirteen annas per maund in [[Bombay]], [[Madras]], the [[Central Provinces]], and the [[princely states]] of [[South India]], was increased to two rupees and eight annas and decreased from three rupees and four annas in Bengal and Assam to two rupees and fourteen annas, and from three rupees to two rupees and eight annas in North India.\n\nSection 39 of the Bombay Salt Act, which was the same as Section 16-17 of the Indian Salt Act, empowered a salt-revenue official to break into places where salt was being illegally manufactured and seize the illegal salt being manufactured. Section 50 of the Bombay Salt Act prohibited the shipping of salt overseas.\n\nThe India Salt Act of 1882 included regulations enforcing a government monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt. Salt could be manufactured and handled only at official government salt depots, with a tax of Rs1-4-0 on each ''maund'' (82 pounds).\n\nIn 1944 the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] passed the Excises and Salt Act (Act No. I of 1944), which, though modified in India and Pakistan, remain in force in Bangladesh.\n\nA new salt tax was introduced to the Republic of India, via the Salt Cess, 1953, which received the assent of the president on 26 December 1953, and was brought into force on 2 January 1954.<ref name=ssa1953 />\n\n{{quote|Then again there is a still more wretched creature, who bears the name of a laborer, whose income may be fixed at thirty-five rupees per annum.

A resolution was passed wherein the delegates present declared 'That this Congress do put on record its disapproval of the recent enhancement of the salt tax as involving a perceptible increase to the burden of the poorer classes, as also the 'partial adoption, in a time of peace and plenty, of the only financial reserve of the Empire.' The 1892 session at Allahabad concluded thus: '...&nbsp; We do not know when the tax will be reduced. So that there is every necessity for our repeating this prayer in the interests of the masses, and we earnestly hope that it will be granted before long'. A similar sort of protest was also issued at the Congress session at [[Ahmedabad]].\n  \nThe salt tax was also protested by eminent people like [[Dadabhai Naoroji]]. On 14 August 1894, he thundered in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]:   \n    \n{{quote|Then the Salt Tax, the cruelest Revenue imposed in any civilized country provided Rs.8,600,000/- and that with the opium 'formed the bulk of the revenue of India, which was drawn from the wretchedness of the people...

Now it would not also matter much about the portion taken by the State if that portion, as in this country, returned to people themselves, from whom it was raised. But the misfortune and the evil was that much of this portion did not return to the people and that the whole system of Revenue and the economic condition of the people became unnatural and oppressive, with dangers to the rulers. So long as the system went on, so long must the people go on, living wretched lives. There was a constant draining away of India's resources, and she could never, therefore, be a prosperous country.

This raise also evoked sharp reactions from Indian nationalists. In 1929, Pandit Nilakantha Das demanded the repeal of the salt tax in the Imperial Legislature but his pleas fell on deaf ears. In 1930, Orissa was close to open rebellion.\n\n==Mahatma Gandhi and the salt tax==\nMohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi had written his first article on the salt tax in 1891 in the periodical ''The Vegetarian''. While in South Africa, he wrote in ''The Indian Opinion'':\n\n{{quote|' The tax levied on salt in India has always been a subject of criticism. This time it has been criticized by the well-known Dr. Hutchinson who says that 'it is a great shame for the British Government in India to continue it, while a similar tax previously in force in Japan has been abolished. Salt is an essential article in our dietary. It could be said that the increasing incidence of leprosy in India was due to the salt tax. Dr. Hutchinson considers the salt tax a barbarous practice, which ill becomes the British Government.}}\n\nIn 1909, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his ''Hind Swaraj'' from South Africa, urging the British administration to abolish the salt tax.\n\n==Gandhi's Salt March==\n[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|Mahatma Gandhi and other ''satyagrahis'' during the Dandi March]]\n\n{{See also|Salt March}}\n\nAt the historic [[Lahore]] session of the Indian National Congress on 26 December 1929 in which ''[[Purna Swaraj]]'' was declared, a passing reference was made to the infamous and oppressive salt law and resolved that a way should be found to oppose it. In the first week of March 1930, Gandhi wrote to [[Lord Irwin]] apprising him of the prevailing social, economic and political conditions in the country.\n\nOn 12 March 1930, Mahatma Gandhi embarked on a sathyagraha with 79 followers from [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]] on the [[Arabian Sea]] coast. This march, known as the ''Dandi March'', was sensationalized by the international press; film clippings and pictures of Mahatma Gandhi were relayed to distant corners of the world. Gandhi reached Dandi on 6 April 1930. After his morning [[bhajan]], he waded in to the sea shore and picked up a handful of salt, proclaiming that with the handful of salt he was proclaiming the end of the British Empire.

However, this [[tax]] was greatly increased when the [[British East India Company]] began to establish its rule over provinces in India. In 1835, special taxes were imposed on Indian [[salt]] to facilitate its import. This paid huge dividends for the [[trade]]rs of the British East India Company. When the Crown took over the administration of India from the Company in 1858, the taxes were not replaced.\n\nThe stringent salt taxes imposed by the British were vehemently condemned by the Indian public. In 1885, at the first session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[Bombay]], a prominent Congress Leader, S.A.Swaminatha Iyer raised the issue of the salt tax.<ref name=\"Salt_history\" /> There were further protests throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries culminating in [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[Salt Satyagraha]] in 1930. This sathyagraha was followed by other sathyagrahas in other parts of the country.\n\nAfter the arrest of Gandhi, [[Sarojini Naidu]] led the sathyagrahis to [[Dharasana Satyagraha|Dharasana Salt works]] in [[Gujarat]] and was arrested by the police officers. [[C. Rajagopalachari]] broke the Salt Laws at [[Vedaranyam]], in Madras Province in the same year. Thousands courted arrest and were imprisoned in large numbers. The administration eventually relented and invited Mahatma Gandhi to England to attend the Second Round Table Conference. Gandhi's Dandi March got wide news coverage and proved to be a turning point in the history of [[Indian independence movement|India's independence movement]].\n\nThe salt tax, however, continued to remain in effect and was repealed only when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] became the prime minister of the interim government in 1946, but later re-introduced via the Salt Cess Act, 1953.<ref name=ssa1953 />\n\n==Taxation of salt==\nSalt taxation originated in ancient China. ''[[Guanzi]]'', a book written in around 300 BC recommends taxation of salt and propounds different methods for this purpose.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/the%20story%20of%20Salt.htm|title=The Story of Salt|accessdate=2008-05-09|author=Mohinder Singh}}</ref> The recommendations of ''Guanzi'' became the official salt policy of early Chinese Emperors. At one point of time, salt taxes constituted over one-half of China's revenues and contributed to the construction of the [[Great Wall of China]].\n\nSalt was also important in the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. The first of the great [[Roman road]]s, the ''[[Via Salaria]]'', or Salt Road, was built for transporting salt.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" /> However, unlike the Chinese, Romans did not monopolize salt.<ref name=\"salt_gandhi\" />\n\nIn Britain, there are references to salt taxes in the [[Domesday Book]] but they had died out before patents were given in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] times. Reintroduced in 1641 in the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period there was such outcry that they were withdrawn on the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and not reinstated till 1693 under [[William III of England|William III]], with duty set at two shillings a bushel on foreign salt, one shilling on native salt with exemption for [[Salted fish|fishery salt]]. In 1696 the tax was doubled and remained in force till abolished in 1825.

Taxes on salt have been prevalent even during the time of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. The ''Arthashastra'', which describes the different duties of the people, says that a special officer called ''lavananadhyaksa'' was appointed to collect the salt tax.

[[Robert Clive]], who returned as [[governor-general]] in 1765, made the sale of [[tobacco]], [[betel nut]], and salt (apart from other accessories and essential [[spices]] and [[condiments]]), the [[monopoly]] of the senior officers of the British East India Company. Contracts were given to deliver salt to depots,<ref name=\"salt1\" /> and merchants were required to buy from these depots.<ref name=\"salt1\" />\n\nThe outrage was expressed by the authorities in England who declared:\n\n{{quote|We consider it too disgraceful, and below the dignity of the present situation, to allow such a monopoly.}}\n\nClive responded by offering the company {{formatnum:1200000}} per annum from the profits made.\n\nHowever, the authorities in England were stubborn, and due to the pressure they exerted, the monopoly of tobacco and betel nut was stopped on 1 September 1767, followed by the annulment of the salt monopoly on 7 October 1768.\n\nIn 1772, the governor-general, [[Warren Hastings]], brought the salt trade once again under the  company's control. The salt works were leased out to farmers who agreed to deliver salt at a fixed rate to the company and sold the leases to the highest bidders. Corruption dealt a severe blow to the company and the revenue from salt trade fell to 80,000 [[rupee]]s by 1780. This, along with the exploitation of the ''malangas'' or salt workers by their landlords, forced Hastings to introduce a new system for controlling the salt trade in India.\n\nIn 1780 Hastings brought the salt trade once again under government control, dividing the infrastructure into agencies, each under the control of an agent and governed by a controller. This system persisted, with minor modifications, until India's independence in 1947. Under this new system, the ''malangas'' sold the salt to the agents at a particular price, initially fixed at 2 rupees a ''[[maund]]'' with a tax of 1.1 to 1.5 rupees a '' maund''. This new system was a success, and in 1781-82, the salt revenue was 2,960,130 rupees. The company received salt revenue of 6,257,750 rupees in 1784-85.\n\nFrom 1788 onwards, the company began selling salt [[wholesalers]] by auction. As a result, the British East India Company increased the tax to 3.25 rupees a ''maund'', and the wholesale price of salt increased from 1.25 to about 4 rupees a ''maund''. This was an exorbitant rate that few could afford.\n\nIn 1804, the British monopolized salt in the newly conquered state of Orissa. In return, they advanced money to the ''malangas'' against future salt production, resulting in the ''malangas'' becoming debtors to the British, virtually becoming economic slaves. The Orissa ''[[zamindars]]'', who had earlier controlled the local salt trade, were alarmed at the sudden loss of income and tried to persuade the ''malanga'' not to work for the British, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early 19th century, to make the salt tax more profitable and reduce smuggling, the East India Company established customs checkpoints throughout Bengal. G. H. Smith established a \"customs line\", which was the boundary across which salt transportation involved payment of high customs duties. In the 1840s a [[Great Hedge of India|thorn fence was erected along the western frontiers of Bengal province]] to prevent salt smuggling. Eventually, after 1857, the thorn fence grew to be 2,500 miles long.\n\n{{quote|A customs line was established, which stretched across the whole of India, which in 1869 extended from the Indus to the Mahanadi in Madras, a distance of 2,300 miles; and it was guarded by nearly 12,000 men and petty officers... it consisted principally of an immense impenetrable hedge of thorny trees and bushes, supplemented by stone wall and ditches, across which no human being or beast of burden or vehicle could pass without being subject to detention or search.|(Strachey and Strachey 1882, 219-20)}}\n\n===Taxation of salt by the British authorities===\nThe taxation laws introduced by the British East India Company were in vogue during the ninety years of [[British Raj]] which followed the demise of the company. The construction of a fence to prevent smuggling of salt, which was commenced during the company's rule, was completed during this period. Sources indicate that by 1858, [[British India]] derived 10% of its revenues from its monopoly of salt.<ref name=\"india_history\">{{cite book | title=A History of India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V73N8js5ZgAC&pg=PT290&dq=british+salt+tax&as_brr=3&sig=gScw3czHTkytpPkAr9UlGIycTF4#PPT290,M1| last=Kulke| first=Hermann|author2=Dietmar Rothermund| year=2004| pages=290}}</ref> However, by the end of the century, the tax on salt had been considerably reduced.<ref name=\"india_history\" /> In 1880, income from salt amounted to 7 million [[pound sterling|pounds]].<ref name=\"hind swaraj\">{{cite book | title=Hind Swaraj and Other Writings | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc47gUOPZfcC&pg=PA20&dq=british+salt+tax&as_brr=3&sig=Jpvh3FITF2Z6lwDF5okHaVRCACA| last=Gandhi|author2=Anthony Parel| year=1997| pages=20| publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\nIn 1900 and 1905, India was one of the largest producers of salt in the world, with a yield of 1,021,426 metric tons and 1,212,600 metric tonnes respectively.\n\nIn 1923, under the viceroyalty of [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading]], a bill was passed doubling the salt tax.

It recommended that Indian salt should be taxed to enable the sale of imported English salt. Consequently, salt was imported from [[Liverpool]], resulting in an increase in salt rates. Subsequently, the government set up a monopoly on the manufacture of salt by the Salt Act. Production of salt was made an offense punishable with six months' imprisonment. The committee also recommended that Indian salt be sold in ''maunds'' of 100. However, they were sold in much lesser quantities.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1888, the salt tax was enhanced by [[Lord Dufferin]] as a temporary measure.<ref name=Naidu>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PbZPP8g4uLkC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=1888,+the+salt+tax+was+enhanced+by+Lord+Dufferin+as+a+temporary&source=bl&ots=vnxDBgJo06&sig=ACfU3U1Uf3KtEX-5yepq28p2tcG0WHT1Vg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGg9Cb2qjkAhWQYcAKHZWNCnwQ6AEwC3oECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=1888,%20the%20salt%20tax%20was%20enhanced%20by%20Lord%20Dufferin%20as%20a%20temporary&f=false|title=Nationalism in South India, Its Economic and Social Background, 1885-1918: A Study of the Madras Government's Policies in the Economic and Social Aspects and Their Impact on Nationalism in the Former Madras Presidency|last=Naidu|first=Ch M.|date=1988|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170990437|language=en}}</ref> [[Cheshire]] salt imported from the United Kingdom was available at a much cheaper rate.

Both production, as well as possession of salt, were made unlawful by this policy. The salt tax, which was one rupee and thirteen annas per maund in [[Bombay]], [[Madras]], the [[Central Provinces]], and the [[princely states]] of [[South India]], was increased to two rupees and eight annas and decreased from three rupees and four annas in Bengal and Assam to two rupees and fourteen annas, and from three rupees to two rupees and eight annas in North India.\n\nSection 39 of the Bombay Salt Act, which was the same as Section 16-17 of the Indian Salt Act, empowered a salt-revenue official to break into places where salt was being illegally manufactured and seize the illegal salt being manufactured. Section 50 of the Bombay Salt Act prohibited the shipping of salt overseas.\n\nThe India Salt Act of 1882 included regulations enforcing a government monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt. Salt could be manufactured and handled only at official government salt depots, with a tax of Rs1-4-0 on each ''maund'' (82 pounds).\n\nIn 1944 the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] passed the Excises and Salt Act (Act No. I of 1944), which, though modified in India and Pakistan, remain in force in Bangladesh.\n\nA new salt tax was introduced to the Republic of India, via the Salt Cess, 1953, which received the assent of the president on 26 December 1953, and was brought into force on 2 January 1954.<ref name=ssa1953 />\n\n{{quote|Then again there is a still more wretched creature, who bears the name of a laborer, whose income may be fixed at thirty-five rupees per annum.

A resolution was passed wherein the delegates present declared 'That this Congress do put on record its disapproval of the recent enhancement of the salt tax as involving a perceptible increase to the burden of the poorer classes, as also the 'partial adoption, in a time of peace and plenty, of the only financial reserve of the Empire.' The 1892 session at Allahabad concluded thus: '...&nbsp; We do not know when the tax will be reduced. So that there is every necessity for our repeating this prayer in the interests of the masses, and we earnestly hope that it will be granted before long'. A similar sort of protest was also issued at the Congress session at [[Ahmedabad]].\n  \nThe salt tax was also protested by eminent people like [[Dadabhai Naoroji]]. On 14 August 1894, he thundered in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]:   \n    \n{{quote|Then the Salt Tax, the cruelest Revenue imposed in any civilized country provided Rs.8,600,000/- and that with the opium 'formed the bulk of the revenue of India, which was drawn from the wretchedness of the people...

Now it would not also matter much about the portion taken by the State if that portion, as in this country, returned to people themselves, from whom it was raised. But the misfortune and the evil was that much of this portion did not return to the people and that the whole system of Revenue and the economic condition of the people became unnatural and oppressive, with dangers to the rulers. So long as the system went on, so long must the people go on, living wretched lives. There was a constant draining away of India's resources, and she could never, therefore, be a prosperous country. Not only that, but in time India must perish, and with it perish the British Empire.<ref name=\"Salt_history\" />}}\n\nIn 1895, George Hamilton stated at a session of the House of Commons that:\n\n{{quote|Time has, however, now come when the Government finds itself in possession of larger surpluses and it is, therefore, its duty as guardian of public exchequer, to reduce taxation on salt.}}\n\nWhen the salt tax was doubled in the year 1923, it was sharply criticized in a report by the Taxation Enquiry Committee which was published two years later. This raise also evoked sharp reactions from Indian nationalists. In 1929, Pandit Nilakantha Das demanded the repeal of the salt tax in the Imperial Legislature but his pleas fell on deaf ears. In 1930, Orissa was close to open rebellion.\n\n==Mahatma Gandhi and the salt tax==\nMohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi had written his first article on the salt tax in 1891 in the periodical ''The Vegetarian''. While in South Africa, he wrote in ''The Indian Opinion'':\n\n{{quote|' The tax levied on salt in India has always been a subject of criticism. This time it has been criticized by the well-known Dr. Hutchinson who says that 'it is a great shame for the British Government in India to continue it, while a similar tax previously in force in Japan has been abolished. Salt is an essential article in our dietary. It could be said that the increasing incidence of leprosy in India was due to the salt tax. Dr. Hutchinson considers the salt tax a barbarous practice, which ill becomes the British Government.}}\n\nIn 1909, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his ''Hind Swaraj'' from South Africa, urging the British administration to abolish the salt tax.\n\n==Gandhi's Salt March==\n[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|Mahatma Gandhi and other ''satyagrahis'' during the Dandi March]]\n\n{{See also|Salt March}}\n\nAt the historic [[Lahore]] session of the Indian National Congress on 26 December 1929 in which ''[[Purna Swaraj]]'' was declared, a passing reference was made to the infamous and oppressive salt law and resolved that a way should be found to oppose it. In the first week of March 1930, Gandhi wrote to [[Lord Irwin]] apprising him of the prevailing social, economic and political conditions in the country.\n\nOn 12 March 1930, Mahatma Gandhi embarked on a sathyagraha with 79 followers from [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]] on the [[Arabian Sea]] coast. This march, known as the ''Dandi March'', was sensationalized by the international press; film clippings and pictures of Mahatma Gandhi were relayed to distant corners of the world. Gandhi reached Dandi on 6 April 1930. After his morning [[bhajan]], he waded in to the sea shore and picked up a handful of salt, proclaiming that with the handful of salt he was proclaiming the end of the British Empire. The police arrived and arrested thousands of national leaders including Gandhi. Gandhi's bold defiance of the salt law encouraged other Indians to break the law as well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gandhi |first=Mahatma |author2=Dalton, Dennis |authorlink2=Dennis Dalton |title=Selected Political Writings |publisher=Hackett Publishing |year=1996 |isbn=0-87220-330-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mahatmagandhisel00maha }} p. 72.</ref>\n\n==Other salt satyagrahas==\nSoon after the conclusion of the [[Salt sathyagraha]] at [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]], Gandhi intended to lead a pack of sathyagrahis to the [[Dharasana Satyagraha|Dharasana Salt Works]] in [[Gujarat]], but was arrested by the police. A few days later, Congress leader [[Abbas Tyabji]] was also arrested. So the mantle fell upon [[Sarojini Naidu]] to lead the sathyagrahis at Dharasana. The sathyagrahis marched to Dharasana, where they were stopped by a deportment of the police. The non-violent sathyagrahis proceed to confront the police and were beaten down. American journalist [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], who witnessed the gruesome scene, counted around 320 bodies. Miller's reporting of the violence at the Dharasana Salt Works was later credited for helping turn world opinion against [[British Raj|British colonial rule of India]].\n\nIn April 1930, Congress leader [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] led a [[Vedaranyam march|salt sathyagraha in Vedaranyam]], Madras province.

The [[Dandi March]] was only partially successful. Though it forced the British rulers to come to the discussion table, the salt tax continued.

{"title_page": "History of the British national debt", "text_new": "[[File:UK National Debt interest.png|thumb|400px|Interest payments on UK National Debt as percentage of GDP from 1900]]\nThe '''history of the British national debt''' can be traced back to the reign of [[William III of England|William III]], who engaged a syndicate of City traders and merchants to offer for sale an issue of government debt, which evolved into [[the Bank of England]]. In 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[United Kingdom national debt|British government debt]] reached a peak of \u00a31 billion (that was more than 200% of GDP).\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the national debt had been gradually reduced to around 30 percent of GDP. However, during World War I the British Government was forced to borrow heavily in order to finance the war effort. The national debt increased from \u00a3650m in 1914 to \u00a37.4 billion in 1919. During World War II the Government was again forced to borrow heavily in order to finance war with the [[Axis powers]]. After the war the debt gradually decreased as a proportion of GDP, but in the 1970s, following a [[Sterling crisis]], the British Government was forced to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nAs the 1980s and 1990s progressed, the proportion of debt to GDP fluctuated up and down according to how the wider economy was performing, remaining relatively constant during the early 1980s recession, falling in the latter half of the decade, and rising again as the [[early 1990s recession]] reduced tax receipts. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the national debt again dropped in relative terms, falling to 29% of GDP by 2002. After that it began to increase, despite sustained economic growth, as the Labour Government led by [[Tony Blair]] increased public expenditure. By 2007 the national debt had increased to 37% of GDP. The deficit continued to grow and, following the [[Great Recession]] beginning in early 2008, both government borrowing and the national debt have risen dramatically, reaching around 70% of GDP by the end of 2012.\n\n==Origins==\n{{main article|United Kingdom national debt}}\n[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|right|The sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694)]]\nThe origins of the British national debt can be found during the reign of [[William III of England|William III]], who engaged a syndicate of City traders and merchants to offer for sale an issue of government debt. This syndicate soon evolved into [[the Bank of England]], eventually financing the wars of the [[Duke of Marlborough]] and later Imperial conquests.\n\nThe establishment of the bank was devised by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], in 1694, to the plan which had been proposed by [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] three years before, but had not been acted upon.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=EkUTaZofJYEC&dq=British+Parliamentary+reports+on+international+finance&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=kHxssmPNow&sig=UyopnsiJSHwk152davCIyQAMVdw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA25,M1 |title=Committee of Finance and Industry 1931 (Macmillan Report) description of the founding of Bank of England  |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=10 May 2010 |quote=Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. 'Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State{{'-}}}}</ref> He proposed a loan of \u00a31.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as ''The Governor and Company of the Bank of England'' with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The [[Royal Charter]] was granted on 27 July through the passage of the [[Tonnage Act 1694]].<ref>H. Roseveare, ''The Financial Revolution 1660\u20131760'' (1991, Longman), p. 34</ref>\n\nPublic finances were in so dire a condition at the time that the terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a service charge of \u00a34,000 per annum for the management of the loan. The first governor was Sir [[John Houblon]], who is depicted in the \u00a350 note issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.\n\nThe founding of the Bank of England put an end to defaults such as the ''[[Great Stop of the Exchequer]]'' of 1672, when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had suspended payments on his bills. From then on, the British Government would never fail to repay its creditors.<ref>Ferguson, ''The Ascent of Money'', p. 76</ref> About {{frac|3|7}} of British national debt in 1776, and {{frac|1|3}} of major stocks like the East India Company, were held by Dutch bankers.<ref>[http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1949_1/1/the_industrial_revolution_17601830.pdf Dutch bankers owned majority of British national debt in early 19th century]</ref>\n\nIn 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], British government debt reached a peak of \u00a31 billion (that was more than 200% of GDP).<ref name=\"public spending\">[http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_national_debt_chart.html UK public spending] Retrieved September 2011</ref>\n\n==The South Sea Company==\nThe Lord Treasurer [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]] established the [[South Sea Company]] in 1711. Nominally, this was a trading company, but its main activity was the funding of government debt. In 1720, a bill was passed making the South Sea Company responsible for the entire national debt. This led to a frenzy of interest in the company, whose shares reached ten times their original issue price. A liquidity problem and collapse followed.

In 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[United Kingdom national debt|British government debt]] reached a peak of \u00a31 billion (that was more than 200% of GDP).\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the national debt had been gradually reduced to around 30 percent of GDP. However, during World War I the British Government was forced to borrow heavily in order to finance the war effort. The national debt increased from \u00a3650m in 1914 to \u00a37.4 billion in 1919. During World War II the Government was again forced to borrow heavily in order to finance war with the [[Axis powers]]. After the war the debt gradually decreased as a proportion of GDP, but in the 1970s, following a [[Sterling crisis]], the British Government was forced to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nAs the 1980s and 1990s progressed, the proportion of debt to GDP fluctuated up and down according to how the wider economy was performing, remaining relatively constant during the early 1980s recession, falling in the latter half of the decade, and rising again as the [[early 1990s recession]] reduced tax receipts. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the national debt again dropped in relative terms, falling to 29% of GDP by 2002. After that it began to increase, despite sustained economic growth, as the Labour Government led by [[Tony Blair]] increased public expenditure. By 2007 the national debt had increased to 37% of GDP. The deficit continued to grow and, following the [[Great Recession]] beginning in early 2008, both government borrowing and the national debt have risen dramatically, reaching around 70% of GDP by the end of 2012.\n\n==Origins==\n{{main article|United Kingdom national debt}}\n[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|right|The sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694)]]\nThe origins of the British national debt can be found during the reign of [[William III of England|William III]], who engaged a syndicate of City traders and merchants to offer for sale an issue of government debt.

The first governor was Sir [[John Houblon]], who is depicted in the \u00a350 note issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.\n\nThe founding of the Bank of England put an end to defaults such as the ''[[Great Stop of the Exchequer]]'' of 1672, when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had suspended payments on his bills.

Danab commandos utilise kevlar vests, tactical helmets with nightvision goggles and other higher end equipment in combat.\n\n====== Weaponry And Equipment c. 2017 ======\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" |Origin\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" |Type\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" |Notes\n|-\n|[[Fiat 6616]]\n|{{flag|Italy}}\n|[[Infantry Fighting Vehicle]]\n|Unknown amount in Service.<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\">Military Balance 2017</ref>\n|-\n|[[Fiat 6616]]\n|{{flag|Italy}}\n|[[Armoured Personnel Carrier]]\n|In Service.<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|-\n|[[Saxon (vehicle)]]\n|{{UK}}\n|[[Armoured Personnel Carrier]]\n|Donated from Djibouti, currently 25 in service.<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|-\n|[[Iveco VM 90]]<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|{{flag|Italy}}\n|[[Armoured Personnel Carrier]]\n|Donated from Italy.\n|-\n|[[Casspir]]\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n|[[MRAP]]\n|9 in Service.<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|-\n|[[RG-31 Nyala]]\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n|[[Infantry Mobility Vehicle]]\n|In Service.<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|-\n|[[BM-21]]\n|{{USSR}}\n|[[Multiple Rocket Launcher]]\n|Unknown amount in service.<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|-\n|[[ZU-23-2]]<ref name=\"Military Balance 2017\" />\n|{{USSR}}\n|[[Anti-Aircraft Gun]]\n|\n|-\n|[[TT pistol]]<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.
