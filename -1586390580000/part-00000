However, the tone of ''Let 'Em Eat Cake'' was much darker and the issues more complex: President Wintergreen is defeated for reelection, and he and his former Vice President, Alexander Throttlebottom, form an incipient Fascist movement to take over the government.\n\n==Productions==\nThe original Broadway production of ''Let 'Em Eat Cake'' opened October 21, 1933 at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]], [[New York City]], USA and ran for 89 performances.

The Opera North production was broadcast by [[BBC Radio 3]] on Saturday, 26 September 2009, as part of its Opera on 3 series.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act I===\n\nPresident Wintergreen is up for reelection, but due to the continuing [[Great Depression]], loses in a landslide to John P. Tweedledee.  Wintergreen makes an unsuccessful appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to overturn the election results.  It is also revealed that Diana Deveraux divorced Throttlebottom to marry the French Ambassador.  After the end of his term, Wintergreen, Throttlebottom, and their associates start a business selling his wife Mary's blue shirts on \"Union Square.\"  At Union Square, Kruger, an agitator, is proclaiming his doctrine \"Down with Everything That's Up.\"  After talking with Kruger, Wintergreen decides that to increase shirt sales they should promise a revolution or their money back, citing the European [[Brown Shirts]] and [[Black Shirts]]. With business now booming (\"Shirts by Millions\"), Mary appeals to the women to join the New Blue [[D.A.R.]] (\"Climb up the Social Ladder\") to increase female shirt sales.  Wintergreen now needs the support of the Union League Club, because General Snookfield is a member. Throttlebottom persuades them by saying that the British are attacking Bunker Hill (\"Comes the Revolution Reprise\").   Having secured the Union League Club support, The Blue Shirts meet with Snookfield to plan the overthrow of the government (\"On and On and On\").  At nine o'clock on July 4, when the Blue Shirts arrive, Snookfield will give the signal for his soldiers to seize Tweedledee.  On the Fourth, at the [[White House]] grounds,  Tweedledee is giving a speech, when Snookfield leaves with Trixie for a party.  The Blue Shirts arrive only to find the general is missing and the soldiers don't know what to do.  Tweedledee promises the army a \"dollar a day which (he) may not pay.\"  Wintergreen  promises the army the war debts owed by the [[League of Nations]], which the soldiers accept.  Tweedledee is deposed, and Wintergreen declares that \"the land of freedom is free once more\" (\"Let 'Em Eat Cake\").\n\n===Act II===\n\nThe White House is being painted \"Blue, Blue, Blue.\"  The Supreme Court, now in chains, are brought before Wintergreen.  He decides to show leniency because the Court officiated his marriage ceremony.  The Court is reorganized into a baseball team.  When the League of Nations arrives to discuss repayment of the war debts, they \"No Comprenez, No Capish, No Versteh\" when the issue is raised; only Finland repays their debt.  Kruger, now head of the army following Snookfield's disgrace, is also putting pressure on Wintergreen to remember his promise.  Wintergreen offers a solution where the debts will be settled by a baseball game for double or nothing.  If the League loses, they will have another conference to discuss it.  Kruger accepts the League's offer of [[Finland]]'s money as a side bet.  Throttlebottom hesitatingly accepts an offer to be the game's umpire.  On the date of the ballgame the Supreme Ball Players, the League, and Kruger's army try to influence Throttlebottom to bend the rules their way. \n \nThe United States loses the game after a controversial call by umpire Throttlebottom.  The soldiers want someone to be held to account for the loss, over Wintergreen and his associates' objections (\"Oyez, Oyez, Oyez\").  In the \"Trial of Throttlebottom\" a military tribunal is underway.  Kruger, the Army, and the Ball Players call for Throttlebottom's execution claiming he conspired with the enemy.  Wintergreen and his associates object, until the army levels the guns at them.  Kruger and the army want to know when they are going be paid (\"A Hell of a Hole\").  After Wintergreen offers them a share of the shirt business, the army is going to take it all (Down With Everything That's Up\u2014Reprise).  Despite pleading he tried his best to get the money (\"It Isn't What You Did\"),  Kruger sentences Wintergreen and his cronies to death by beheading.  Mary and the condemned's wives enter and proclaim they are pregnant.  Kruger says this may have worked four years ago during Wintergreen's impeachment hearings, but it doesn't work with the army.   Trixie, who controls the Navy, arrives and joins forces with Kruger (\"First Lady and First Gent\").  Kruger proclaims \"Let 'em Eat Caviar.\"\n\nExecution day arrives, and in their jail cell Wintergreen, Throttlebotton, and the Committee discuss how they ended up in this situation.  Next, the crowds gather to watch the executions (\"Hanging Throttlebottom in the Morning\").  A guillotine bought from France is unveiled, and Snookfield is shown to be the executioner.  Since Throttlebottom is not married, he will be executed first. After a series of mishaps with the guillotine, Mary interrupts the proceedings.  She presents a \"Fashion Show\" with dresses that arrived on the boat that brought the guillotine.  After being reminded that the color of the revolution is blue, and they cannot wear the new fashions, the women revolt.  Kruger objects, but the soldiers seize him after Trixie reminds them of an upcoming party.\n\nWintergreen tells the soldiers to shoot Kruger. When Kruger reveals he used to be in the dress making business, Wintergreen decides to go into business with him.  Wintergreen decides to leave the revolution business and restores the republic and the Supreme Court.  Tweedledee shows up and Wintergreen gives his vice-president, Throttlebottom, to him, since he can't remember his. Tweedledee declines the Presidency, since he is going to be [[President of Cuba]].  Throttlebottom is now the President.  After Wintergreen promised the people cake and Kruger promised them caviar, Throttlebottom promises them pistache ice cream, which he formerly detested.\n\n==Songs==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Act I===\n* Overture - Orchestra\n* Opening Act 1\n** Wintergreen for President - Ensemble\n** Tweedledee for President - Ensemble\n* Union Square Scene\n** Union Square - Ensemble\n** Down With Everyone Who's Up - Kruger and Agitators\n* Store Scene\n** Shirts by Millions - Wives and Ensemble\n** Comes the Revolution - Alexander Throttlebottom and Ensemble\n** Mine - John P.

In Portuguese, ''batida'' means ''shaken'' or ''milkshake''.  It is made with cacha\u00e7a, [[fruit juice]] (or [[coconut milk]]), and sugar. It can be blended or shaken with ice.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, batidas are traditionally served with [[feijoada]].\n\nA variation is made adding sweet [[condensed milk]] or [[sour cream]].\n\nThe most common fruit used in a Batida are lemon, [[passion fruit]] and [[coconut]].\n{{clear|right}}\n\n==Rabo-de-galo==\n\n'''Rabo-de-galo''', which means \"cock tail\" (in Brazilian Portuguese ''cocktail'' is called ''coquetel''), is a Brazilian drink made of cacha\u00e7a and red [[vermouth]]. It is also known as Tra\u00e7ado, the Portuguese word for mixed. Alternatively, is known as a mixture of \"everything you have in the bar\" in some places. <!-- gallo is rooster in Spanish, galo is rooster in Portuguese --> It is questionable whether the proportions in rabo-de-galo have ever been formally established.

He'd made the awful journey that so many others had: he pulled himself from the clutches of 'The [communist] God That Failed,' and then in his writing fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought \u2013 a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.}}\n\nAs he recalled him, the new president outlined the ideas Meyer synthesized as the principles for this new conservative movement.\n\n{{quote|It was Frank Meyer who reminded us that the robust individualism of the American experience was part of the deeper current of Western learning and culture. He pointed out that a respect for law, an appreciation for tradition, and regard for the social consensus that gives stability to our public and private institutions, these civilized ideas must still motivate us even as we seek a new economic prosperity based on reducing government interference in the marketplace. Our goals complement each other. We're not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management. This is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities, only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government.\n\nWe can make government again responsive to the people by cutting its size and scope and thereby ensuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly. Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government,  we can be very clear: We do not have a separate social agenda, separate economic agenda, and a separate foreign agenda. We have one agenda. Just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nation's defenses, so too we seek to protect the unborn, to end the manipulation of schoolchildren by utopian planners, and permit the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions.<ref>Ronald Reagan, \"Address to the Conservative Political Action Conference,\" March 20, 1981, {{cite web |url=http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110134608/http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |archivedate=2012-01-10 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Political history==\nFusionism saw its height during the [[Reagan administration|presidency]] of [[Ronald Reagan]], who had brought together the divided factions after [[Gerald Ford]]'s loss in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]].

After listing \"intellectual leaders like Russell Kirk, Friedrich Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Milton Friedman, James Burnham, [and] Ludwig von Mises\" as the ones who \"shaped so much of our thoughts,\" he discussed only one of these influences at length:\n\n{{quote|It's especially hard to believe that it was only a decade ago, on a cold April day on a small hill in upstate New York, that another of these great thinkers, Frank Meyer, was buried. He'd made the awful journey that so many others had: he pulled himself from the clutches of 'The [communist] God That Failed,' and then in his writing fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought \u2013 a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.}}\n\nAs he recalled him, the new president outlined the ideas Meyer synthesized as the principles for this new conservative movement.\n\n{{quote|It was Frank Meyer who reminded us that the robust individualism of the American experience was part of the deeper current of Western learning and culture. He pointed out that a respect for law, an appreciation for tradition, and regard for the social consensus that gives stability to our public and private institutions, these civilized ideas must still motivate us even as we seek a new economic prosperity based on reducing government interference in the marketplace. Our goals complement each other. We're not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management. This is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities, only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government.\n\nWe can make government again responsive to the people by cutting its size and scope and thereby ensuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly. Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government,  we can be very clear: We do not have a separate social agenda, separate economic agenda, and a separate foreign agenda. We have one agenda. Just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nation's defenses, so too we seek to protect the unborn, to end the manipulation of schoolchildren by utopian planners, and permit the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions.<ref>Ronald Reagan, \"Address to the Conservative Political Action Conference,\" March 20, 1981, {{cite web |url=http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110134608/http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |archivedate=2012-01-10 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Political history==\nFusionism saw its height during the [[Reagan administration|presidency]] of [[Ronald Reagan]], who had brought together the divided factions after [[Gerald Ford]]'s loss in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]].

The style was most prominently used in the construction of cathedrals. Its defining features are [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]], [[rib vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, and an extensive use of [[stained glass]]. Combined, these features allowed the creation of buildings of unprecedented height and grandeur, filled with light from large stained glass windows. Important examples include [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].  The English Gothic style endured in England until the early sixteenth century \u2013 much longer than in Continental Europe. It was succeeded by [[Tudor architecture]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].  \n\nThe Gothic style was introduced from France, where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] north of Paris, completed in 1094.<ref name=HF>{{cite book |last1=Honour |first1=Hugh |author-link1=Hugh Honour |last2=Fleming |first2=John |author-link2=John Fleming (art historian) |date=2009 |title=A World History of Art |edition=7th |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |isbn=9781856695848 |page=376}}</ref> The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England were [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]].  Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from [[Romanesque architecture]] (often known in England as [[Norman architecture]]).  Other features were imported from the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]], had been built in 1135\u20131164.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mignon |first=Olivier |date=2015 |title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques |location= |publisher= |pages=10-11 |isbn=}}</ref>  After a fire destroyed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174, The French architect [[William of Sens]] rebuilt the choir in the new Gothic style between 1175 and 1180.  \n\nThe transition can also be seen at [[Durham Cathedral]], a Norman building which was remodeled with the earliest [[rib vault]] known. Besides cathedrals, the style appeared in university buildings,  [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[great house]]s, and many smaller secular buildings, including [[almshouse]]s and [[parish church]]es.\n\nHistorians traditionally divide English Gothic into three periods: [[Early English (architecture)|Early English]] (c. 1180\u20131275),  [[Decorated Gothic]] (c. 1275\u20131380), and [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520). <ref> This scheme uses the labels coined by the antiquary [[Thomas Rickman]] in his ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) </ref>  The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.  With he exception of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], English Cathedrals show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years.\n<!---\n==Background== \n===Historical=== \n*Edward the Confessor fostered monasticism and founds Westminster Abbey\n*1066 and all that.

(A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages''(1922). pp. 35-45</ref>  It succeeded [[Norman Architecture]], which had introduced early great cathedrals, built of stone instead of timber, and saw the construction of remarkable abbeys throughout England. The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture, and created massive walls for their buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190. in the reigns of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and [[Richard I]]. The style changed from the more massive severe Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. \n35-45</ref>  \n\nEarly English Gothic was particularly influenced by what was called in English \"The French style\". The style was imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also imported cut stones from Normandy for their construction.  It was also influenced by the architecture of the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] had been constructed.  The nave of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the first early English Gothic structures in England, was rebuilt in the new style by a French architect, [William of Sens]]. \n\nThe Early English style particularly featured more strongly-constructed walls with stone vaulted roofs, to resist fire. The weight of these vaults was carried downwards and outwards by arched ribs. This feature, the early [[rib vault]], was used at [[Durham Cathedral]], the first time it was used this way in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother important innovation introduced in this early period was the [[buttress]], a stone column outside the structure which reinforced the walls against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults.  This evolved into the [[flying buttress]], which carried the thrust from the from the wall of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further support by a heavy stone pinnacle. Butressses were an early feature of the chapter house of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' pp. 35-45 </ref>  \n\nAnother innovation introduced in early English Gothic was the [[Lancet window]], a tall narrow window with a pointed arch on top.  They were grouped together side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions in tracery patterns, such as ''cusps'', or spear-points.  Lancet windows were combined similarly pointed arches and the ribs of the vaults overhead, giving a harmonious and unified style.  The first English Cathedral tbe be built entirely in the Gothic style was [[Wells Cathedral]].   By 1175, with the completion of the Choir at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]], the style was firmly established in England.\n\n===Characteristics  ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] rebuilt by [[William of Sens]] (1174-1184)\nFile:Wells cathedral nave clerestory.JPG|The three levels of the nave of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1176-1450), the first in England to use the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] exclusively in the ceiling vaults, the windows of the [[clerestory]] and arcades of the [[triforium]], and the arcades on the ground floor. \nFile:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window (N.31) (21975539699).jpg|The Dean's Eye Window, a rare English [[rose window]], at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220-1235)\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Detail Bosses.jpg|Early four-part [[rib vault]]s at [[Salisbury Cathedral]], with a simple carved stone [[boss (architecture)|boss]] at the meeting point of the ribs (1220-1258)\nFile:Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG|Lancet windows in the north transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220-1258)\n</gallery>\n* The '''vertical plan''' of  early Gothic Cathedrals had three levels, each of about equal height;  the [[clerestory]], with arched windows which admitted light on top, under the roof vaults;  the [[triforium]] a wider covered arcade, in the middle; and, on the ground floor, on either side of the [[nave]], wide arcades of columns and pillars, which supported the weight of the ceiling vaults through the ribs.\n \n* The most distinctive element of this period was the '''[[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]''', (also known as the [[lancet arch]], which was the key feature of the Gothic [[rib vault]],   The original purpose of rib vault was to allow a heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman churches, which frequently caught fire.   They also had the benefit of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls.   They appeared first in an early form in [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Gradually, pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of the arcades and for [[lancet windows]]s,  giving the nave its unified appearance. The first structure in England to be built entirely with the pointed arch was [[Wells Cathedral]] (1175-1260), but they were soon used in all Cathedrals. <ref>Bechmann (2017), page=295</ref>  \n\n* The Early English '''[[rib vault]]s''' were usually quadripartite, each having four compartments divided by ribs, , with each covering one bay of the ceiling.  The horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars or columns of the triforium and arcades, and, in later cathedrals, outside the walls to the buttresses. <ref>A. Freeman Smith )1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\n* The '''[[lancet window]]''', narrow and tall with a point at the top, became a common feature of English architecture.   For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the Lancet style.  The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes. This characteristic is seen throughout [[Salisbury Cathedral]], where groups of two lancet windows line the nave and groups of three line the clerestory. At [[York Minster]] the north transept has a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters; each is 50 feet tall and still retains its original glass.\n\n* [[Stained glass]] windows began to be widely used in the windows of the [[clerestory]], [[transept]] and especially west facade.   Many were elaborately decorated with [[tracery]]; that is, thin [[mullions]] or ribs of stone which divided the windows into elaborate geometric patterns.   as at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220). \n\n* '''[[Rose window |Rose Windows]]''' were relatively rare in England, but [[Lincoln Cathedral]] has two notable examples from this period. The oldest is the Dean's Window in the north transept, which dates to 1220-1235. It is an example of an Early English plate-tracery rose window. The geometric design, with concentric tiers of circular window lights, predates the geometric tracery of the later decorated style of Gothic architecture.  The principal theme of the window is the second coming of Christ and the last judgement. Some scenes are associated with death and resurrection, such as the funeral of Saint Hugh, the founder of the Cathedral, and the death of the Virgin. <ref> [http://www.lincolncathedral.com/ Lincoln Cathedral Official Website]</ref>\n\n* '''Sculptural  decoration'''. Unlike the more somber and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches began to have  elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps, carved circles, and with [[trefoil]]s, [[quatrefoil]]s, as well as floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on the capitals, the [[spandrels]], the [[roof boss]] that joined the ribs of the vaults.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n* The '''clustered column'''. Instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which descended the vaults above.  These were often made of dark, polished [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck \"marble\"]]) surrounding a central pillar, or [[pier (architecture)|pier]], to which they are attached by circular moulded shaft-rings. One characteristic of Early Gothic in England is the great depth given to the hollows of the [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]] with alternating fillets and rolls, and by the decoration of the hollows with the dog-tooth [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] and by the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] or tops of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns. <ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n===Notable Early Gothic structures===\n* [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1185-1311)\n* Nave and transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], without tower (1220-1258)\n* Transept of [[Westminster Abbey]]\n* [[Whitby Abbey]] \n* [[Rievaulx Abbey]]\n* The Galilee Porch of [[Ely Cathedral]]\n* Nave and transept of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1225-1240)\n* West front of [[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n* South transept of [[York Cathedral]]\n\n==Decorated Gothic {{anchor|Decorated Gothic}} (mid 13th to mid 14th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nYork Minster - panoramio - PJMarriott (1).jpg|The west facade of [[York Minster]] (1338), showing the elaborate [[tracery]] in the main window.\nFile:Ely Cathedral Choir, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The choir of [[Ely Cathedral]], rebuilt in Decorated Gothic beginning in 1321\n</gallery>\n\nThe second period of English Gothic architecture is generally termed '''Decorated Gothic''', because the amount of ornament and decoration increased dramatically.  It was a period of growing prosperity in England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Cathedrals.  Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.\n\nHistorians sometimes subdivide this style into two periods, based on the predominant motifs of the designs.   The first, the '''Geometric''' style, lasted (about 1245 or 50 until 1315 or 1360), where ornament tended to be based on straight lines, cubes and circles, followed by the '''Curvilinear''' style (from about 1290 or 1315 until 1350 or 1360)  which used gracefully curving lines.  <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 45-47 </ref>\n\nAdditions in the Decorated style were often added to earlier cathedrals.  One striking example is found at [[Ely Cathedral]], The architect [[Thomas Witney]] built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in Decorated style. Soon afterwards another architect, William Joy, added curving arches to strengthen the structure, and made further extensions to join the Lady Chapel to the Choir. In 1329-45 he created an extraordinary double arch in the decorated style. <ref>|Harvey (1987), pg.163</ref> \n\n===Characteristics===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ely Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]] of the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|Lierne vault of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1351-1377)\nFile:The Cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|[[Fan vault]]s in cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1373)\nFile:West porch Lichfield by Francis Frith.jpeg|Decorated ornament on the west porch of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 002.jpg|[[Tracery]], [[diapering]] and sculptural decoration on [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\nFile:Chapter House, Lichfield Cathedral (exterior 5).JPG|Early buttresses, topped by pinnacles, at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:26-Ely-005.jpg|[[Pinnacles]] on the roof of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Carlisle Cathedral Tracery, Cumbria, UK - Diliff.jpg|East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], with curvilinear tracery (about 1350)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 010.jpg|Floral [[boss (architecture)|boss]] joining the ribs of the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n</gallery>\n\n*  The '''[[Lierne (vault)|Lierne Vault]]''' .   [[Vault (architecture)|Vaulting]] became much more elaborate in this period. The  [[rib vault]] of earlier Early Gothic usually had just four compartments, with a minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below, and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs.  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Ely Cathedral]] have notable Lierne vaults from this period. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nThe [[buttress]] became more common in this period, as at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. These were stone columns outside the walls which supportsd them, allowing thinner and high walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The buttresses wee often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them greater weight.   \n\n* The '''[[Fan vault]]''', An even more eleborate form, appeared late in the Decorative.   Unlike the Lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the visible \"ribs\" are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The structure is composed of slabs of stone joined together into half-cones, whose vertices are the springers of the vault. The earliest example, from 1373, is found in the cloisters of  [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. It made a notable backdrop in some of the [[Harry Potter]] films. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n* '''[[Tracery]]'''. Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the elaborate [[tracery]]  within the stained glass windows. The elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel [[mullion]]s (vertical bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called [[tracery]], typically including [[trefoil]]s and [[quatrefoil]]s. The style was [[Geometry|geometrical]] at first and [[curvilinear]], or curving and serpentine, in the later period,  This curvilinear element was introduced in the first quarter of the 14th century and lasted about fifty years.<ref name=\"EB1911DP\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Decorated Period|volume=7|page=915|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref>. A notable example of the curvilinear style is the East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], (about 1350).\n\n* '''Sculpture''' also became more ornate and decorative. The [[ball flower]] and a four-leaved flower motif took the place of the earlier [[dog-tooth]]. The foliage in the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] was less conventional than in Early English and more flowing, Another decorative feature of the period was [[diapering]], or creating multicolour geometric patterns on walls or panels made with different colours of stone or brick.  <ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n===Notable examples===\n*[[Lincoln Cathedral]] (west facade and Angel Choir)\n*[[Carlisle Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[York Minster]] (West facade) \n*[[Lichfield Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n*[[Ely Cathedral]] (Portions including Galilee porch, lady chapel and choir (1322-28)\n*[[Melrose Abbey]] (The Lady Chapel) [[Scotland]],<ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n==Perpendicular Gothic {{anchor|Perpendicular Gothic}} (late 13th to mid 16th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The interior of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] conveys an impression of a \"cage\" of stone and glass, typical of Perpendicular architecture.

A notable early example is the  [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], built by the royal architect [[William Ramsey (architect)|William Ramsey]] in 1332. <ref> John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) puts the earliest example of a fully formed Perpendicular style at the [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], in 1332 </ref>  The early style was also practiced by Ramsey and another royal architect,  [[John Sponlee]], and fully developed in the works of [[Henry Yevele]] and [[William Wynford]].\n\nWalls were built much higher than in earlier periods, and stained glass windows became very large, so that the space around them was reduced to simple piers. Horizontal transoms sometimes had to be introduced to strengthen the vertical [[mullions]]. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 53-62</ref>  \n\nMany of the cathedrals and churches were built with magnificent towers ([[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and Boston Church (Lincolnshire), Wrexham Church, Taunton Church, and others. Other Notable examples include [[Kings College, Cambridge|Kings College Chapel, Cambridge]]  <ref name=\"harvey1978\">{{Cite book| title=The Perpendicular Style| first=John| last=Harvey| publisher=Batsford| year=1978}}</ref> \n\nThe interiors of Perpendicular churches were filled with lavish ornamental woodwork, including choir seats with lifting seats (''Misereres''), under which were grotesque carvings;; \"Poppy heads\", or carved figures in foliage on the ends of benches; and elaborate multicoloured decoration, usually in floral patterns, on panels or cornices called ''[[brattishing]]''. <ref>{Smith (1922) pp. 53-62 </ref>   The sinuous lines of the tracery in the Decorated style wee replaced by more geometric forms and [[perpendicular]] lines. <ref name=\"EB1911PP\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Perpendicular Period|volume=21|pages=179\u2013180|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref> \n\nThe style was also affected by the tragic history of the period, particuarly  [[Black Death]] which killed an estimated third of England's population in 18 months between June 1348 and December 1349 and returned in 1361\u201362 to kill another fifth.

Gradually, near the end of the period, Renaissance forms began to appear in the English Gothic. A [[rood screen]], a Renaissance ornament, was installed in the chapel of [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge.  During the [[Elizabethan Period]] (1558-1603), the classical details, including the five orders of classical architecture, were gradually introduced. Carved ornament with Italian Renaissance motifs began to be used in decoration, including on the tomb of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The pointed arch gradually gave way to the Roman rounded arch, brick began to replace masonry, the roof construction was concealed, and the Gothic finally gave way to an imitation of Roman and Greek styles. <ref>Smith, A.

The mullions of the windows are carried vertically up into the [[arch]] moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by additional mullions (supermullions) and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s, forming rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery.   The [[Tudor Arch]] window was a particular feature of English Gothic. \n\n* '''[[Buttress]]es''' and wall surfaces were divided into vertical panels.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> \n\n* '''Doorways''' were frequently enclosed within a square head over the arch mouldings, the [[spandrel]]s being filled with [[quatrefoil]]s or tracery.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> Pointed arches were still used throughout the period, but [[ogee]] and four-centred [[Tudor arch]]es were also introduced.\n\n* Inside the church the [[triforium]] disappeared, or its place was filled with panelling, and greater importance was given to the [[clerestory]] windows, which often were the finest features in the churches of this period. The mouldings were  flatter than those of the earlier periods, and one of the chief characteristics is the introduction of large [[elliptical]] hollows.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/>\n\n* '''Flint architecture'''.

It had to be able to resist rain, snow and high winds of the English climate, and to preserve the integrity of the structure.  A pitched roof was a common feature of all the Gothic periods. During the Norman period, the roofs normally were pitched forty-five degrees, with the apex forming a right angle, which harmonised with the rounded arches of the gables.  With the arrival of the pointed [[rib vault]], the roofs became steeper, up to sixty degrees. In the late perpendicular period, the angle declined to twenty degrees or even less. The roofs were usually made of boards overlaid with tiles or sheet-lead, which was commonly used on low-pitched roofs. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>\n\nThe simpler Gothic roofs were supported by long [[rafter]]s of light wood, resting on wooden [[trusses]] set into the walls. The rafters were supported by more solid beams, called ''purlins'', which were carried at their ends by the roof [[truss]]es.  The ''tie-beam'' is the chief beam of the truss.  Later, the roof was supported by structures called a King-point-truss and Queen-post truss, where The principal rafters are connected with the tie beam by head of the truss. The King-Point truss has a vertical beam with connects the centre of the rafter to the ridge of the roof, supported by diagonal struts, while a  Queen-Post truss has a wooden collar below the pointed arch which united the posts and was supported by struts and cross-braces. A Queen-Post truss could span w width of forty feet. Both of these forms created greater stability, but the full weight of the roof still came down directly onto the walls. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71</ref> \n\nGothic architects did not like the roof truss systems, because the numerous horizontal beams crossing the nave obstructed  the view of the soaring height. They came up with an ingenious solution,  the [[Hammerbeam roof]].  In this system, the point  of the roof is supported by the collar and trusses, but from the collar curved beams reach well downward on the walls, and carry the weight downward and outwards, to the walls and buttresses, without obstructing the view.  The oldest existing roof of this kind is found in [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The most famous example of the   [[Hammerbeam roof]] is the roof of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395), the largest timber roof of its time, built for royal ceremonies such as the banquets following the coronation of the King.  Other notable wooden roofs included those of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Crosby Hall, Liverpool|Crosby Hall]].  A similar system, with a arched trusses, was used in the roof of Wexham Cathedral.<ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>  \n\n\n<!---NOTE:Collected these pics to use in expansion of article.

The style was most prominently used in the construction of cathedrals. Its defining features are [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]], [[rib vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, and an extensive use of [[stained glass]]. Combined, these features allowed the creation of buildings of unprecedented height and grandeur, filled with light from large stained glass windows. Important examples include [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].  The English Gothic style endured in England until the early sixteenth century \u2013 much longer than in Continental Europe. It was succeeded by [[Tudor architecture]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].  \n\nThe Gothic style was introduced from France, where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]] north of Paris, completed in 1094.<ref name=HF>{{cite book |last1=Honour |first1=Hugh |author-link1=Hugh Honour |last2=Fleming |first2=John |author-link2=John Fleming (art historian) |date=2009 |title=A World History of Art |edition=7th |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |isbn=9781856695848 |page=376}}</ref> The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England were [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]].  Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from [[Romanesque architecture]] (often known in England as [[Norman architecture]]).  Other features were imported from the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]], had been built in 1135\u20131164.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mignon |first=Olivier |date=2015 |title=Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques |location= |publisher= |pages=10-11 |isbn=}}</ref>  After a fire destroyed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174, The French architect [[William of Sens]] rebuilt the choir in the new Gothic style between 1175 and 1180.  \n\nThe transition can also be seen at [[Durham Cathedral]], a Norman building which was remodeled with the earliest [[rib vault]] known. Besides cathedrals, the style appeared in university buildings,  [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[great house]]s, and many smaller secular buildings, including [[almshouse]]s and [[parish church]]es.\n\nHistorians traditionally divide English Gothic into three periods: [[Early English (architecture)|Early English]] (c. 1180\u20131275),  [[Decorated Gothic]] (c. 1275\u20131380), and [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520). <ref> This scheme uses the labels coined by the antiquary [[Thomas Rickman]] in his ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) </ref>  The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.  With he exception of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], English Cathedrals show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years.\n<!---\n==Background== \n===Historical=== \n*Edward the Confessor fostered monasticism and founds Westminster Abbey\n*1066 and all that.

(A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages''(1922). pp. 35-45</ref>  It succeeded [[Norman Architecture]], which had introduced early great cathedrals, built of stone instead of timber, and saw the construction of remarkable abbeys throughout England. The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture, and created massive walls for their buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190. in the reigns of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and [[Richard I]]. The style changed from the more massive severe Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. \n35-45</ref>  \n\nEarly English Gothic was particularly influenced by what was called in English \"The French style\". The style was imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also imported cut stones from Normandy for their construction.  It was also influenced by the architecture of the [[Ile-de-France]], where the first French Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] had been constructed.  The nave of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], one of the first early English Gothic structures in England, was rebuilt in the new style by a French architect, [William of Sens]]. \n\nThe Early English style particularly featured more strongly-constructed walls with stone vaulted roofs, to resist fire. The weight of these vaults was carried downwards and outwards by arched ribs. This feature, the early [[rib vault]], was used at [[Durham Cathedral]], the first time it was used this way in Europe. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnother important innovation introduced in this early period was the [[buttress]], a stone column outside the structure which reinforced the walls against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults.  This evolved into the [[flying buttress]], which carried the thrust from the from the wall of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further support by a heavy stone pinnacle. Butressses were an early feature of the chapter house of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. <ref>A. Freeman Smith, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' pp. 35-45 </ref>  \n\nAnother innovation introduced in early English Gothic was the [[Lancet window]], a tall narrow window with a pointed arch on top.  They were grouped together side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions in tracery patterns, such as ''cusps'', or spear-points.  Lancet windows were combined similarly pointed arches and the ribs of the vaults overhead, giving a harmonious and unified style.  The first English Cathedral tbe be built entirely in the Gothic style was [[Wells Cathedral]].   By 1175, with the completion of the Choir at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]], the style was firmly established in England.\n\n===Characteristics  ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] rebuilt by [[William of Sens]] (1174-1184)\nFile:Wells cathedral nave clerestory.JPG|The three levels of the nave of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1176-1450), the first in England to use the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] exclusively in the ceiling vaults, the windows of the [[clerestory]] and arcades of the [[triforium]], and the arcades on the ground floor. \nFile:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window (N.31) (21975539699).jpg|The Dean's Eye Window, a rare English [[rose window]], at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220-1235)\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Detail Bosses.jpg|Early four-part [[rib vault]]s at [[Salisbury Cathedral]], with a simple carved stone [[boss (architecture)|boss]] at the meeting point of the ribs (1220-1258)\nFile:Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG|Lancet windows in the north transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220-1258)\n</gallery>\n* The '''vertical plan''' of  early Gothic Cathedrals had three levels, each of about equal height;  the [[clerestory]], with arched windows which admitted light on top, under the roof vaults;  the [[triforium]] a wider covered arcade, in the middle; and, on the ground floor, on either side of the [[nave]], wide arcades of columns and pillars, which supported the weight of the ceiling vaults through the ribs.\n \n* The most distinctive element of this period was the '''[[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]''', (also known as the [[lancet arch]], which was the key feature of the Gothic [[rib vault]],   The original purpose of rib vault was to allow a heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman churches, which frequently caught fire.   They also had the benefit of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls.   They appeared first in an early form in [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|title=Durham World Heritage Site|publisher=UN|accessdate=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803095035/https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance|archive-date=3 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Gradually, pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of the arcades and for [[lancet windows]]s,  giving the nave its unified appearance. The first structure in England to be built entirely with the pointed arch was [[Wells Cathedral]] (1175-1260), but they were soon used in all Cathedrals. <ref>Bechmann (2017), page=295</ref>  \n\n* The Early English '''[[rib vault]]s''' were usually quadripartite, each having four compartments divided by ribs, , with each covering one bay of the ceiling.  The horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars or columns of the triforium and arcades, and, in later cathedrals, outside the walls to the buttresses. <ref>A. Freeman Smith )1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\n* The '''[[lancet window]]''', narrow and tall with a point at the top, became a common feature of English architecture.   For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the Lancet style.  The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes. This characteristic is seen throughout [[Salisbury Cathedral]], where groups of two lancet windows line the nave and groups of three line the clerestory. At [[York Minster]] the north transept has a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters; each is 50 feet tall and still retains its original glass.\n\n* [[Stained glass]] windows began to be widely used in the windows of the [[clerestory]], [[transept]] and especially west facade.   Many were elaborately decorated with [[tracery]]; that is, thin [[mullions]] or ribs of stone which divided the windows into elaborate geometric patterns.   as at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1220). \n\n* '''[[Rose window |Rose Windows]]''' were relatively rare in England, but [[Lincoln Cathedral]] has two notable examples from this period. The oldest is the Dean's Window in the north transept, which dates to 1220-1235. It is an example of an Early English plate-tracery rose window. The geometric design, with concentric tiers of circular window lights, predates the geometric tracery of the later decorated style of Gothic architecture.  The principal theme of the window is the second coming of Christ and the last judgement. Some scenes are associated with death and resurrection, such as the funeral of Saint Hugh, the founder of the Cathedral, and the death of the Virgin. <ref> [http://www.lincolncathedral.com/ Lincoln Cathedral Official Website]</ref>\n\n* '''Sculptural  decoration'''. Unlike the more somber and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches began to have  elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps, carved circles, and with [[trefoil]]s, [[quatrefoil]]s, as well as floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on the capitals, the [[spandrels]], the [[roof boss]] that joined the ribs of the vaults.<ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n* The '''clustered column'''. Instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which descended the vaults above.  These were often made of dark, polished [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck \"marble\"]]) surrounding a central pillar, or [[pier (architecture)|pier]], to which they are attached by circular moulded shaft-rings. One characteristic of Early Gothic in England is the great depth given to the hollows of the [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]] with alternating fillets and rolls, and by the decoration of the hollows with the dog-tooth [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] and by the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] or tops of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns. <ref name=\"EB1911EEP\"/>\n\n===Notable Early Gothic structures===\n* [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1185-1311)\n* Nave and transept of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], without tower (1220-1258)\n* Transept of [[Westminster Abbey]]\n* [[Whitby Abbey]] \n* [[Rievaulx Abbey]]\n* The Galilee Porch of [[Ely Cathedral]]\n* Nave and transept of [[Wells Cathedral]] (1225-1240)\n* West front of [[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n* South transept of [[York Cathedral]]\n\n==Decorated Gothic {{anchor|Decorated Gothic}} (mid 13th to mid 14th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nYork Minster - panoramio - PJMarriott (1).jpg|The west facade of [[York Minster]] (1338), showing the elaborate [[tracery]] in the main window.\nFile:Ely Cathedral Choir, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The choir of [[Ely Cathedral]], rebuilt in Decorated Gothic beginning in 1321\n</gallery>\n\nThe second period of English Gothic architecture is generally termed '''Decorated Gothic''', because the amount of ornament and decoration increased dramatically.  It was a period of growing prosperity in England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Cathedrals.  Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.\n\nHistorians sometimes subdivide this style into two periods, based on the predominant motifs of the designs.   The first, the '''Geometric''' style, lasted (about 1245 or 50 until 1315 or 1360), where ornament tended to be based on straight lines, cubes and circles, followed by the '''Curvilinear''' style (from about 1290 or 1315 until 1350 or 1360)  which used gracefully curving lines.  <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 45-47 </ref>\n\nAdditions in the Decorated style were often added to earlier cathedrals.  One striking example is found at [[Ely Cathedral]], The architect [[Thomas Witney]] built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in Decorated style. Soon afterwards another architect, William Joy, added curving arches to strengthen the structure, and made further extensions to join the Lady Chapel to the Choir. In 1329-45 he created an extraordinary double arch in the decorated style. <ref>|Harvey (1987), pg.163</ref> \n\n===Characteristics===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ely Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]] of the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral Vaulted Ceiling.jpg|Lierne vault of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1351-1377)\nFile:The Cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|[[Fan vault]]s in cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1373)\nFile:West porch Lichfield by Francis Frith.jpeg|Decorated ornament on the west porch of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 002.jpg|[[Tracery]], [[diapering]] and sculptural decoration on [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\nFile:Chapter House, Lichfield Cathedral (exterior 5).JPG|Early buttresses, topped by pinnacles, at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] (1195-1340)\nFile:26-Ely-005.jpg|[[Pinnacles]] on the roof of [[Ely Cathedral]] (1321-1351)\nFile:Carlisle Cathedral Tracery, Cumbria, UK - Diliff.jpg|East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], with curvilinear tracery (about 1350)\nFile:Exeter cathedral 010.jpg|Floral [[boss (architecture)|boss]] joining the ribs of the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n</gallery>\n\n*  The '''[[Lierne (vault)|Lierne Vault]]''' .   [[Vault (architecture)|Vaulting]] became much more elaborate in this period. The  [[rib vault]] of earlier Early Gothic usually had just four compartments, with a minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below, and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs.  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Ely Cathedral]] have notable Lierne vaults from this period. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nThe [[buttress]] became more common in this period, as at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. These were stone columns outside the walls which supportsd them, allowing thinner and high walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The buttresses wee often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them greater weight.   \n\n* The '''[[Fan vault]]''', An even more eleborate form, appeared late in the Decorative.   Unlike the Lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the visible \"ribs\" are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The structure is composed of slabs of stone joined together into half-cones, whose vertices are the springers of the vault. The earliest example, from 1373, is found in the cloisters of  [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. It made a notable backdrop in some of the [[Harry Potter]] films. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman, ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 71-73</ref>\n* '''[[Tracery]]'''. Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the elaborate [[tracery]]  within the stained glass windows. The elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel [[mullion]]s (vertical bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called [[tracery]], typically including [[trefoil]]s and [[quatrefoil]]s. The style was [[Geometry|geometrical]] at first and [[curvilinear]], or curving and serpentine, in the later period,  This curvilinear element was introduced in the first quarter of the 14th century and lasted about fifty years.<ref name=\"EB1911DP\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Decorated Period|volume=7|page=915|first=Richard Phen\u00e9|last=Spiers|authorlink=Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers}}</ref>. A notable example of the curvilinear style is the East window of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], (about 1350).\n\n* '''Sculpture''' also became more ornate and decorative. The [[ball flower]] and a four-leaved flower motif took the place of the earlier [[dog-tooth]]. The foliage in the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] was less conventional than in Early English and more flowing, Another decorative feature of the period was [[diapering]], or creating multicolour geometric patterns on walls or panels made with different colours of stone or brick.  <ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n===Notable examples===\n*[[Lincoln Cathedral]] (west facade and Angel Choir)\n*[[Carlisle Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[York Minster]] (West facade) \n*[[Lichfield Cathedral]] (west facade)\n*[[Exeter Cathedral]] (1258-1400)\n*[[Ely Cathedral]] (Portions including Galilee porch, lady chapel and choir (1322-28)\n*[[Melrose Abbey]] (The Lady Chapel) [[Scotland]],<ref name=\"EB1911DP\"/>\n\n==Perpendicular Gothic {{anchor|Perpendicular Gothic}} (late 13th to mid 16th century)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The interior of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] conveys an impression of a \"cage\" of stone and glass, typical of Perpendicular architecture.

A notable early example is the  [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], built by the royal architect [[William Ramsey (architect)|William Ramsey]] in 1332. <ref> John Harvey (historian)|Harvey]] (1978) puts the earliest example of a fully formed Perpendicular style at the [[chapter house]] of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], in 1332 </ref>  The early style was also practiced by Ramsey and another royal architect,  [[John Sponlee]], and fully developed in the works of [[Henry Yevele]] and [[William Wynford]].\n\nWalls were built much higher than in earlier periods, and stained glass windows became very large, so that the space around them was reduced to simple piers. Horizontal transoms sometimes had to be introduced to strengthen the vertical [[mullions]]. <ref>Smith, A. Freeman ''English Church Architecture of the Middle Ages'' (1922), pp. 53-62</ref>  \n\nMany of the Cathedrals and churches were built with magnificent towers ([[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and Boston Church (Lincolnshire), Wrexham Church, Taunton Church, and others.

Gradually, near the end of the period, Renaissance forms began to appear in the English Gothic. A [[rood screen]], a Renaissance ornament, was installed in the chapel of [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge.  During the [[Elizabethan Period]] (1558-1603), the classical details, including the five orders of classical architecture, were gradually introduced. Carved ornament with Italian Renaissance motifs began to be used in decoration, including on the tomb of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The pointed arch gradually gave way to the Roman rounded arch, brick began to replace masonry, the roof construction was concealed, and the Gothic finally gave way to an imitation of Roman and Greek styles. <ref>Smith, A.

Important towers were built at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[York Minster]], [[Worcester Cathedral]], and on many smaller churches.  Decorative [[Battlements]] were a popular decoration of towers in smaller churches.  \n\n* '''Windows''' became very large, sometimes of immense size, with slimmer stone [[mullion]]s than in earlier periods, allowing greater scope for [[stained glass]] craftsmen. The mullions of the windows are carried vertically up into the [[arch]] moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by additional mullions (supermullions) and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s, forming rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery.   The [[Tudor Arch]] window was a particular feature of English Gothic. \n\n* '''[[Buttress]]es''' and wall surfaces were divided into vertical panels.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> \n\n* '''Doorways''' were frequently enclosed within a square head over the arch mouldings, the [[spandrel]]s being filled with [[quatrefoil]]s or tracery.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/> Pointed arches were still used throughout the period, but [[ogee]] and four-centred [[Tudor arch]]es were also introduced.\n\n* Inside the church the [[triforium]] disappeared, or its place was filled with panelling, and greater importance was given to the [[clerestory]] windows, which often were the finest features in the churches of this period. The mouldings were  flatter than those of the earlier periods, and one of the chief characteristics is the introduction of large [[elliptical]] hollows.<ref name=\"EB1911PP\"/>\n\n* '''Flint architecture'''.  In areas of [[Southern England]] using [[flint]] architecture, elaborate [[flushwork]] decoration in flint and [[ashlar]] was used, especially in the [[wool church]]es of [[East Anglia]].\n\n===Notable examples===\n* [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]] (1446\u20131515) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121130024710/http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/]\n* [[Eton College Chapel, Eton]] (1448\u20131482) [http://www.etoncollege.com/OurHistory.aspx]\n* late 15th-century tower, [[New College, Oxford]] (1380\u201386, [[Henry Yevele]]);\n* [[Divinity School, Oxford]] (1427\u201383);\n* [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick|Beauchamp Chapel, Warwick]] (1381\u201391);\n* Quire and tower of [[York Minster]] (1389\u20131407);\n* remodelling of the nave and aisles of [[Winchester Cathedral]] (1399\u20131419);\n* transept and tower of [[Merton College, Oxford]] (1424\u201350);\n* [[Manchester Cathedral]] (1422);\n* central tower of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (1454\u201357);\n* central tower of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1475\u201380);\n* choir of [[Sherborne Abbey]] (1475\u2013c. 1580)\n* Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity, [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire.

It had to be able to resist rain, snow and high winds of the English climate, and to preserve the integrity of the structure.  A pitched roof was a common feature of all the Gothic periods. During the Norman period, the roofs normally were pitched forty-five degrees, with the apex forming a right angle, which harmonised with the rounded arches of the gables.  With the arrival of the pointed [[rib vault]], the roofs became steeper, up to sixty degrees. In the late perpendicular period, the angle declined to twenty degrees or even less. The roofs were usually made of boards overlaid with tiles or sheet-lead, which was commonly used on low-pitched roofs. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>\n\nThe simpler Gothic roofs were supported by long [[rafter]]s of light wood, resting on wooden [[trusses]] set into the walls. The rafters were supported by more solid beams, called ''purlins'', which were carried at their ends by the roof [[truss]]es.  The ''tie-beam'' is the chief beam of the truss.  Later, the roof was supported by structures called a King-point-truss and Queen-post truss, where The principal rafters are connected with the tie beam by head of the truss. The King-Point truss has a vertical beam with connects the centre of the rafter to the ridge of the roof, supported by diagonal struts, while a  Queen-Post truss has a wooden collar below the pointed arch which united the posts and was supported by struts and cross-braces. A Queen-Post truss could span w width of forty feet. Both of these forms created greater stability, but the full weight of the roof still came down directly onto the walls. <ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71</ref> \n\nGothic architects did not like the roof truss systems, because the numerous horizontal beams crossing the nave obstructed  the view of the soaring height. They came up with an ingenious solution,  the [[Hammerbeam roof]].  In this system, the point  of the roof is supported by the collar and trusses, but from the collar curved beams reach well downward on the walls, and carry the weight downward and outwards, to the walls and buttresses, without obstructing the view.  The oldest existing roof of this kind is found in [[Winchester Cathedral]]. The most famous example of the   [[Hammerbeam roof]] is the roof of [[Westminster Hall]] (1395), the largest timber roof of its time, built for royal ceremonies such as the banquets following the coronation of the King.  Other notable wooden roofs included those of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Crosby Hall, Liverpool|Crosby Hall]].  A similar system, with a arched trusses, was used in the roof of Wexham Cathedral.<ref>Smith (1922), pages 63-71 </ref>  \n\n\n<!---NOTE:Collected these pics to use in expansion of article.

The Devils made the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] all but three times between 1988 and 2012, qualified for five Stanley Cup Finals (in 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2012) and won the [[Stanley Cup]] three times (in 1995, 2000 and 2003).<ref name=\"Playoffs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/NJ| title = New Jersey Devils History| accessdate = November 19, 2006| publisher = CBS Sportsline}}</ref> Lamoriello also served as general manager for [[United States men's national ice hockey team|Team USA]] in the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], in which the U.S. won the [[gold medal]], as well as for the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]].<ref name=\"One-on-One with Lou Lamoriello\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononeb200901.shtml|title=One-on-One with Lou Lamoriello|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref> Lamoriello also played a key role in negotiating the settlement of the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]] to resume play for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nIn 2009, Lamoriello was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame#Builders|builders category]],<ref name=HHOF>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind09prolog.htm#1styears |title=Hockey Hall of Fame Announces 2009 Inductees |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |work=Legends of Hockey |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706135908/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind09prolog.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2010 }}</ref> while in 2012, Lamoriello was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nLamoriello was born in [[Johnston, Rhode Island|Johnston]], [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=\"All the coaches he's fired and other things to know about new Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello\">{{cite news|last1=Kestler-D\u2019Amours|first1=Jillian|title=All the coaches he's fired and other things to know about new Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2015/07/23/all-the-coaches-hes-fired-and-other-things-to-know-about-new-leafs-gm-lou-lamoriello.html|accessdate=July 23, 2015|publisher=Toronto Star|date=July 23, 2015}}</ref> After attending [[La Salle Academy]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], Lamoriello graduated from [[Providence College]] in 1963.<ref name=LamorielloTrophy>{{cite web|title=Hockey East Tournament: Lou Lamoriello and the Lamoriello Trophy|publisher=HockeyEastOnline.com|url=http://www.hockeyeastonline.com/men/tourney/index.php|accessdate=January 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027015447/http://www.hockeyeastonline.com/men/tourney/index.php#|archive-date=October 27, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He received [[varsity letter]]s in [[baseball]] and hockey and served each team as captain during his senior year.<ref name=LamorielloTrophy/> He played [[collegiate summer baseball]] in the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] (CCBL) for the [[Harwich Mariners]] (1961-62), [[Orleans Cardinals]] (1963), and in 1964 as the [[player-manager]] of the [[Bourne Braves|Bourne Canalmen]].

Lamoriello named himself general manager just before the start of the [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388 season]], a move that surprised many NHL observers. He had never played, coached or managed in the NHL, and was virtually unknown outside the American college hockey community.\n\nOver the next 28 years, Lamoriello presided over one of the most successful rebuilding projects in North American professional sports history. In his first season as general manager, the Devils notched their first winning season in franchise history (dating back to their time as the [[Kansas City Scouts]] [1974\u201376] and [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] [1976\u201382]) and reached the [[Wales Conference]] Finals. The Devils made the playoffs in all but five of his 27 seasons as general manager, and appeared in the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] in [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1995]] (won), [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|2000]] (won), [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2001]] (lost), [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2003]] (won) and 2012 (lost). After [[Yankee Global Enterprises|YankeeNets]] bought the Devils in 2000, Lamoriello was named chairman and CEO of the Devils, as well as vice-chairman and CEO of the then co-owned [[New Jersey Nets]]. He dropped the chairmanship of the Devils and resigned his posts on the Nets after [[Jeffrey Vanderbeek]] bought the Devils from YankeeNets in 2004. For the most part, McMullen, Vanderbeek and current owner [[Joshua Harris (businessman)|Joshua Harris]] left the Devils' operations in Lamoriello's hands.\n\nIn 1992, Lamoriello was awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] for outstanding service to hockey in the United States. He also served as general manager for [[United States men's national ice hockey team|Team USA]] in the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]<ref name=\"One-on-One with Lou Lamoriello\"/> (in which the U.S. won the gold medal) and the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nLamoriello is well known in NHL circles for his hard-nosed approach to contract negotiations. [[Pat Verbeek]], [[Kirk Muller]] and [[Bill Guerin]], among others, have been traded out of town after losing contract negotiations. He nearly traded [[Ken Daneyko]], the Devils' all-time leader in games played, in 1989. According to Daneyko, Lamoriello believes in paying a third-line player as much as a first-line player if he feels they have the same value to the team.<ref name=\"HockeyChron\">{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref>\n\nLamoriello, backed by Scouting Director David Conte, is known as a master drafter, showing consistent shrewdness in identifying and signing top talent that other teams were passing over.<ref name=\"Farber\">{{Cite news \n | first = Michael\t\t\n | last = Farber\n | authorlink =\n | title = The Devil's Advocate\n | url = \n | format = \n | work = \n | publisher = Sports Illustrated\n | pages = \n | page = 38\n | date = 1999-03-22\n | accessdate = \n | language = \n | quote = \n}}</ref> For example, superstar goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] was a 20th overall pick, while Czech star left winger [[Patrik Eli\u00e1\u0161]] was drafted 51st.

The former high school math teacher says that during his two-decade long tenure at Providence College, and later when commissioner of Hockey East, he followed professional hockey closely. When he started with the Devils in 1987, he says he took what he considered to be the best parts of the great teams \u2014 the [[Green Bay Packers]], the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] \u2014 and using his analytical background, applied them to managing the Devils.<ref name=\"Wigge\">{{Cite news \n | first = Larry\t\t\n | last = Wigge\n | authorlink =\n | title = Q&A\n | url = \n | format = \n | work = \n | publisher = Sporting News\n | pages = \n | page = 43\n | date = June 11, 2001\n | accessdate = \n | language = \n | quote = \n}}</ref>\n\n\"Lou's a model for our business.

Based on my college background, I like to look at my roster as my seniors, juniors, sophomores and freshmen and gauge their development and roster turnover based on players going from one of those classes into the next.

We stress that in drafting, player development, and coaching. You grow from your mistakes.

Despite public disagreements, both superstar [[Claude Lemieux]] and former assistant coach [[John MacLean (ice hockey)|John MacLean]] returned to the organization because of Lamioriello's \"dedication to winning\". Veteran Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko says Lamoriello key factors in success are \"his winning attitude, discipline and dedication.

On April 30, 2018, Shanahan informed Lamoriello that he will no longer continue as general manager, but would remain with the organization as a special advisor. Shanahan stated that Lamoriello's contract called for him to serve as general manager for three years before making a transition to an advisory role.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.tsn.ca/lamoriello-will-not-return-as-leafs-gm-1.1072178| title=Lamoriello will not return as Leafs GM| website=tsn.ca| date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> \n\nMuch as he did in New Jersey, Lamoriello helped rebuild a previously moribund team.

When asked on television after the Devils' victory over the [[New York Rangers]] in the first round of the playoffs if he was interested in becoming head coach permanently, Lamoriello replied, \"Absolutely not,\" eventually hiring [[Claude Julien (ice hockey)|Claude Julien]] as head coach following the season.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, Lamoriello fired Julien and named himself interim coach once again.

He is also the former [[general manager]] of both the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the NHL. Lamoriello's tenure as general manager of the New Jersey Devils from 1987 to 2015 was the third-longest by an NHL general manager with a single team, following those of [[Conn Smythe]] and [[Art Ross]]. Lamoriello resigned from New Jersey on May 4, 2015, and became the 16th general manager of the Maple Leafs on July 23 of the same year.\n\nUnder Lamoriello's management, the Devils, who had been barely competitive for their first five years in New Jersey, became one of the most successful teams in the NHL. The Devils made the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] all but three times between 1988 and 2012, qualified for five Stanley Cup Finals (in 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2012) and won the [[Stanley Cup]] three times (in 1995, 2000 and 2003).<ref name=\"Playoffs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/NJ| title = New Jersey Devils History| accessdate = November 19, 2006| publisher = CBS Sportsline}}</ref> Lamoriello also served as general manager for [[United States men's national ice hockey team|Team USA]] in the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], in which the U.S. won the [[gold medal]], as well as for the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]].<ref name=\"One-on-One with Lou Lamoriello\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononeb200901.shtml|title=One-on-One with Lou Lamoriello|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref> Lamoriello also played a key role in negotiating the settlement of the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]] to resume play for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nIn 2009, Lamoriello was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame#Builders|builders category]],<ref name=HHOF>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind09prolog.htm#1styears |title=Hockey Hall of Fame Announces 2009 Inductees |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |work=Legends of Hockey |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706135908/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind09prolog.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2010 }}</ref> while in 2012, Lamoriello was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nLamoriello was born in [[Johnston, Rhode Island|Johnston]], [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=\"All the coaches he's fired and other things to know about new Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello\">{{cite news|last1=Kestler-D\u2019Amours|first1=Jillian|title=All the coaches he's fired and other things to know about new Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2015/07/23/all-the-coaches-hes-fired-and-other-things-to-know-about-new-leafs-gm-lou-lamoriello.html|accessdate=July 23, 2015|publisher=Toronto Star|date=July 23, 2015}}</ref> After attending [[La Salle Academy]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], Lamoriello graduated from [[Providence College]] in 1963.<ref name=LamorielloTrophy>{{cite web|title=Hockey East Tournament: Lou Lamoriello and the Lamoriello Trophy|publisher=HockeyEastOnline.com|url=http://www.hockeyeastonline.com/men/tourney/index.php|accessdate=January 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027015447/http://www.hockeyeastonline.com/men/tourney/index.php#|archive-date=October 27, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He received [[varsity letter]]s in [[baseball]] and hockey and served each team as captain during his senior year.<ref name=LamorielloTrophy/> He played [[collegiate summer baseball]] in the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] (CCBL) for the [[Harwich Mariners]] (1961-62), [[Orleans Cardinals]] (1963), and in 1964 as the [[player-manager]] of the [[Bourne Braves|Bourne Canalmen]].

Lamoriello named himself general manager just before the start of the [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388 season]], a move that surprised many NHL observers. He had never played, coached or managed in the NHL, and was virtually unknown outside the American college hockey community.\n\nOver the next 28 years, Lamoriello presided over one of the most successful rebuilding projects in North American professional sports history. In his first season as general manager, the Devils notched their first winning season in franchise history (dating back to their time as the [[Kansas City Scouts]] [1974\u201376] and [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] [1976\u201382]) and reached the [[Wales Conference]] Finals. The Devils made the playoffs in all but five of his 27 seasons as general manager, and appeared in the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] in [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1995]] (won), [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|2000]] (won), [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2001]] (lost), [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2003]] (won) and 2012 (lost). After [[Yankee Global Enterprises|YankeeNets]] bought the Devils in 2000, Lamoriello was named chairman and CEO of the Devils, as well as vice-chairman and CEO of the then co-owned [[New Jersey Nets]]. He dropped the chairmanship of the Devils and resigned his posts on the Nets after [[Jeffrey Vanderbeek]] bought the Devils from YankeeNets in 2004. For the most part, McMullen, Vanderbeek and current owner [[Joshua Harris (businessman)|Joshua Harris]] left the Devils' operations in Lamoriello's hands.\n\nIn 1992, Lamoriello was awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] for outstanding service to hockey in the United States. He also served as general manager for [[United States men's national ice hockey team|Team USA]] in the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]<ref name=\"One-on-One with Lou Lamoriello\"/> (in which the U.S. won the gold medal) and the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nLamoriello is well known in NHL circles for his hard-nosed approach to contract negotiations. [[Pat Verbeek]], [[Kirk Muller]] and [[Bill Guerin]], among others, have been traded out of town after losing contract negotiations. He nearly traded [[Ken Daneyko]], the Devils' all-time leader in games played, in 1989. According to Daneyko, Lamoriello believes in paying a third-line player as much as a first-line player if he feels they have the same value to the team.<ref name=\"HockeyChron\">{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref>\n\nLamoriello, backed by Scouting Director David Conte, is known as a master drafter, showing consistent shrewdness in identifying and signing top talent that other teams were passing over.<ref name=\"Farber\">{{Cite news \n | first = Michael\t\t\n | last = Farber\n | authorlink =\n | title = The Devil's Advocate\n | url = \n | format = \n | work = \n | publisher = Sports Illustrated\n | pages = \n | page = 38\n | date = 1999-03-22\n | accessdate = \n | language = \n | quote = \n}}</ref> For example, superstar goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] was a 20th overall pick, while Czech star left winger [[Patrik Eli\u00e1\u0161]] was drafted 51st.

The former high school math teacher says that during his two-decade long tenure at Providence College, and later when commissioner of Hockey East, he followed professional hockey closely. When he started with the Devils in 1987, he says he took what he considered to be the best parts of the great teams \u2014 the [[Green Bay Packers]], the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] \u2014 and using his analytical background, applied them to managing the Devils.<ref name=\"Wigge\">{{Cite news \n | first = Larry\t\t\n | last = Wigge\n | authorlink =\n | title = Q&A\n | url = \n | format = \n | work = \n | publisher = Sporting News\n | pages = \n | page = 43\n | date = June 11, 2001\n | accessdate = \n | language = \n | quote = \n}}</ref>\n\n\"Lou's a model for our business.

It was one of the reasons cited by Bettman for Lamiorello's 2009 induction into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.nj.com/devils/index.ssf/2009/11/post_7.html| duplicate_title = <!-- required -->\n| accessdate = June 12, 2012\n| author = Rick Chere\n| title = 'Visionary' NJ Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello set for Hall of Fame induction\n| authorlink = \n| date = November 8, 2009\n| month = \n| website = \n| publisher = The Star-Ledger\n| pages = \n| language = \n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nLamoriello has fostered a \"unique corporate culture\" that has encouraged player loyalty.

I don\u2019t ever use the word 'rebuild.' Based on my college background, I like to look at my roster as my seniors, juniors, sophomores and freshmen and gauge their development and roster turnover based on players going from one of those classes into the next. You have to build your staff and encourage them to be creative and realistic in their approach\u2014and (not) be afraid to make a mistake. We stress that in drafting, player development, and coaching. You grow from your mistakes. I know I have.\"<ref name=\"Wigge\"/>\n\nWhen others are asked what makes Lamoriello successful, his dedication and singular focus on winning are mentioned again and again. Despite public disagreements, both superstar [[Claude Lemieux]] and former assistant coach [[John MacLean (ice hockey)|John MacLean]] returned to the organization because of Lamioriello's \"dedication to winning\". Veteran Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko says Lamoriello key factors in success are \"his winning attitude, discipline and dedication. Nobody works harder\".<ref name=\"Yorio\"/>\n\nOn May 4, 2015, the Devils announced Lamoriello had handed his general manager post to [[Ray Shero]], though he would remain as team president.\n\n===Toronto Maple Leafs===\nOn July 23, 2015, Lamoriello resigned from the New Jersey Devils to accept the general manager position with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name=\"All the coaches he's fired and other things to know about new Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello\"/> Lamoriello worked under Maple Leafs president [[Brendan Shanahan]], who was the first player Lamoriello drafted as an NHL general manager in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]].  On April 30, 2018, Shanahan informed Lamoriello that he will no longer continue as general manager, but would remain with the organization as a special advisor. Shanahan stated that Lamoriello's contract called for him to serve as general manager for three years before making a transition to an advisory role.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.tsn.ca/lamoriello-will-not-return-as-leafs-gm-1.1072178| title=Lamoriello will not return as Leafs GM| website=tsn.ca| date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> \n\nMuch as he did in New Jersey, Lamoriello helped rebuild a previously moribund team. The Leafs had only made the playoffs once in ten years, but rebounded to make the playoffs in his last two seasons as general manager. To date, Lamoriello's stint in Toronto is the only time in his career as an NHL executive that he did not have the final say in hockey matters.\n\n===New York Islanders===\nOn May 22, 2018, Lamoriello was hired by the [[New York Islanders]] as their president of hockey operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lamoriello Named President of Hockey Operations|url=https://www.nhl.com/islanders/news/lamoriello-named-president-of-hockey-operations/c-298735484|website=NHL.com|accessdate=May 22, 2018|date=May 22, 2018}}</ref> On June 5, 2018, Lamoriello fired head coach [[Doug Weight]] and general manager [[Garth Snow]] and named himself general manager.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islanders relieve GM Garth Snow, head coach Doug Weight of duties|url=https://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/islanders/islanders-garth-snow-doug-weight-1.18985504|website=Newsday.com|accessdate=June 5, 2018|date=June 5, 2018}}</ref> On June 21st, Lamoriello would go on to sign [[Barry Trotz]] as head coach fresh off a Stanley Cup victory, and a subsequent resignation from the [[Washington Capitals]].\n\n==Brief coaching stints==\nOn December 19, 2005, following the surprise resignation of [[Larry Robinson]] as Devils head coach, Lamoriello named himself interim head coach for the rest of the season. The Devils eventually made it the [[2005 Stanley Cup playoffs|Eastern Conference Semifinals]] before falling to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]. When asked on television after the Devils' victory over the [[New York Rangers]] in the first round of the playoffs if he was interested in becoming head coach permanently, Lamoriello replied, \"Absolutely not,\" eventually hiring [[Claude Julien (ice hockey)|Claude Julien]] as head coach following the season.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, Lamoriello fired Julien and named himself interim coach once again. The firing took place with three games left in the season, when the Devils had the second-best record in the East and were on their way to setting a franchise record for regular season wins. However, Lamoriello did not believe Julien had the team ready for the playoffs.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Devils' big shake-up \u2013 Julien fired, Lamoriello back behind
