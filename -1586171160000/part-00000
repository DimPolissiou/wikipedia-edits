Jacob's sight, meantime, is fading; he is slowly going blind, a fact he hides from his son. Riley refuses to forgive his father until old friend Ben Ryerson explains to him that Jacob didn't desert his mother at all.\n\nKing comes to town with his men. Riley, aware for the first time of his father's failing vision, acts as his eyes in directing Jacob where to shoot.

Jacob rides to Red Bluff hoping to reconcile with his son, unaware that King Fisher holds a grudge and intends to shoot down Jacob, first chance.\n\nRiley accompanies his father on the trail, setting their family ranch ablaze first, never letting him out of his sight. Jacob's sight, meantime, is fading; he is slowly going blind, a fact he hides from his son. Riley refuses to forgive his father until old friend Ben Ryerson explains to him that Jacob didn't desert his mother at all.\n\nKing comes to town with his men. Riley, aware for the first time of his father's failing vision, acts as his eyes in directing Jacob where to shoot. King's men die and he tries to sneak away, but he and Jacob end up in a showdown anyway and kill one another. Jacob dies in his son's arms.\n\n== Cast ==\t\t\n*[[Jack Palance]] as Jacob Wade\n*[[Anthony Perkins]] as Riley Wade\n*[[Neville Brand]] as King Fisher\n*Elaine Aiken as Ada Marshall\n*[[Robert Middleton]] as Ben Ryerson\n*[[Elisha Cook,  Jr.]] as Willie \n*[[Claude Akins]] as Blackburn\n*[[Lee Van Cleef]] as Faro\n*[[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]] as Dr. Fisher\n*[[James Bell (actor)|James Bell]] as Judge Hart\n*[[Adam Williams (actor)|Adam Williams]] as Lon\n*[[Denver Pyle]] as Brad\n*[[John Doucette]] as Sundown Whipple\n*[[Paul Newlan]] as Fence Green \n*[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] as Singer\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0050652|The Lonely Man}}\n\n{{Henry Levin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lonely Man, The}}\n[[Category:1957 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:1950s Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Henry Levin]]\n{{1950s-Western-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonely_Man"}
