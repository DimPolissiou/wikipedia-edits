He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is \"Coach Hines\", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]). During seasons 9 and 10, Key appeared as \"Dr. Funkenstein\" in blaxploitation parodies, with Peele playing the monster. Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes \"backstage\" as Eugene Struthers, an ecstatic water-or-flower delivery man who accosts celebrities. There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming \"It was crazy as hell!\" Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James \"Thunder\" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').

There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming \"It was crazy as hell!\" Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James \"Thunder\" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').
