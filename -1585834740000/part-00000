The series began serialization in [[Futabasha]]'s ''Monthly Action'' magazine in May 2013, and is licensed in North America by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]]. Two spin-off manga, one by Mitsuhiro Kimura and the other by Ayami Kazama, are serialized in ''Monthly Action''. An [[anime]] television series produced by [[Kyoto Animation]] aired in Japan between January and April 2017. A second anime season has been greenlit.\n\n==Plot==\nAs office worker Kobayashi gets ready for work, she is greeted by a large dragon right outside her front door. The dragon immediately transforms into a human girl in a [[French maid|maid outfit]], and introduces herself as Tohru. It turns out that during a drunken excursion into the mountains the night before, Kobayashi had encountered the dragon, who claims to have come from another world. Subsequently, Kobayashi had removed a holy sword from Tohru's back, earning her gratitude. With Tohru having no place to stay, Kobayashi offers to let the dragon stay at her home and become her personal maid, to which she agrees. Despite being efficient at housework, Tohru's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up scaring Kobayashi and bringing more trouble than help. Additionally, Tohru's presence attracts other dragons, gods, and mythical beings to her new home.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n;{{Nihongo|Kobayashi|\u5c0f\u6797}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mutsumi Tamura]]<ref name=ann/>|[[Leah Clark]]<ref name=\"dub cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/01/03/official-winter-2017-simuldub-lineup/#dragon|title=Official Winter 2017 Simuldub Linup - Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid|publisher=[[Funimation]]|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>}}\n:A normal programmer and office worker who suddenly finds herself living with a [[dragon]] after removing a divine sword from it on a drunken night.

A [[running gag]] involves her attempting to feed Kobayashi pieces of her tail (which she can regenerate) with her cooking as a sign of affection and a sign of love.\n;{{nihongo|Kanna Kamui|\u30ab\u30f3\u30ca\u30ab\u30e0\u30a4}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Maria Naganawa]]<ref name=ann/>|[[Jad Saxton]]<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n:Tohru's friend from the dragon realm who was exiled from her world for pulling too many pranks on other dragons and wound up living with Kobayashi as well. Although she is much older than she appears, she is very young by dragon standards, equivalent to a primary school student at {{Nihongo|Oborozuka Elementary School|\u6727\u30ba\u30ab \u5c0f\u5b66\u6821|Oborozuka Sh\u014dgakk\u014d}}, which she attends as a third grade student bearing Kobayashi's surname. She initially assumes that Kobayashi seduced Tohru into staying and wanted her to return to their original world. She grows increasingly attached to Kobayashi as the series progresses, viewing her as a mother figure. Kanna's basis and tribal attire are inspired by [[Kamuy|the culture of the]] [[Ainu people|indigenous natives of Hokkaido]] and claims to be from [[Ushishir]]. She bears feather-like horns and a thin tail ending in a bulb, and is capable of recharging her depleted magical energy with electricity.\n\n===Dragons===\n;{{nihongo|Elma|\u30a8\u30eb\u30de|Eruma}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Takada]]<ref name=ann/>|Rachel Glass}}\n:A [[Leviathan|water dragon]] belonging to the Order faction, rival to Tohru's Chaos faction, who ends up working alongside Kobayashi at her office after getting stuck in the human world. She is as powerful as she is diligent and driven, but also naive, indecisive, and easily swayed by food (primarily sweets) due to her low income. Her human form is distinguished by purple hair, a horn (which she hides for work), her habit of having a jacket or kimono hanging off her shoulder, and wielding a trident;  {{nihongo|Elma Joui|\u4e0a\u4e95 \u30a8\u30eb\u30de|J\u014di Eruma}} is the identity she uses while in Kobayashi's workplace.\n; {{nihongo|Lucoa|\u30eb\u30b3\u30a2|Rukoa}} {{anchor|Quetzalcoatl}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Minami Takahashi (voice actress)|Minami Takahashi]]<ref name=ann/>|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n: {{nihongo|Quetzalcoatl|\u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb\u30b3\u30a2\u30c8\u30eb|Ketsarukoatoru}} is an [[Aztec]] dragon goddess and another friend of Tohru, who lost her divine status centuries ago after getting drunk and causing a scandal involving her younger sister, much like the [[Quetzalcoatl]] of the original mythology. She is often referred to as Lucoa (from \"lcoa\" of the deity's name as adapted to the [[Kana|Japanese syllabary]]) and Tohru sees her as a source of wisdom but will sometimes casually reference the events in her past, much to Lucoa's embarrassment. She lives with Shouta after she interrupted his summoning spell to prevent him from summoning a dangerous demon, causing him to mistakenly believe she is a [[succubus]]. Lucoa appears in her human form as a tall, well-endowed woman with striking [[heterochromia]]. She often becomes overly affectionate with Shouta, scaring him, and having others mark her as a pervert. She tends to wear tight-fitting clothing that shows a lot of skin, and a running gag involves her showing up to a public place only to be dragged away by a staff member for being dressed inappropriately.\n;{{nihongo|Fafnir|\u30d5\u30a1\u30d5\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb|Fafun\u012bru}} {{anchor|Takeshi Ooyama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Ono]]|Garret Storms<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n:Another old friend of Tohru, he is a male dragon with a strong distrust for humans which leads to him questioning much of Tohru's actions and ideals in his earlier appearances. He shares some resemblance to the traits of [[Fafnir|his namesake]], such as his cold demeanour and disdainful mentality. He appears as a refined young man with long black hair and red eyes in his human form. After Tohru's attempts to find him a place to stay (under the name {{nihongo|Takeshi Ooyama|\u5927\u5c71 \u731b|\u014cyama Takeshi}}), Fafnir eventually comes to live with Takiya, becoming obsessed with video games and [[popular culture]].\n;{{nihongo|Ilulu|\u30a4\u30eb\u30eb|Iruru}}\n:A Chaos faction dragon who targets Tohru because of her relationship with a human, attempting to destroy the city in the process. She then turns her eye to Kobayashi, trying to drive her and Tohru apart to prove her beliefs, but after Kobayashi and Tohru save her from an Order dragon she has a change of heart and ends up living with them. Ilulu appears in her human form as a petite girl with a very ample bust. Her mental growth was somewhat impaired due to various beliefs that were forced on her by other chaos dragons. When she was younger, she enjoyed playing with human children, and since coming to Earth, she has taken up a job at a candy store, so that she can still see children when they are happy. \n;{{nihongo|Damocles, the Emperor of Demise|\u7d42\u7109\u5e1d|Sh\u016bentei}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takayuki Sug\u014d]]|John McCalmont}}\n:Tohru's father, who disapproves of Tohru's relationship with Kobayashi due to their beliefs as Chaos dragons and because of a non-interference rule about Earth. He attempts to force Tohru to leave with him but decides to let her stay after Kobayashi stands up to him, despite knowing how easily he could kill her. He still leaves Kobayashi alive, as he does not want to risk angering Tohru, who he recognizes as stronger than him.\n\n===Humans===\n;{{nihongo|Makoto Takiya|\u6edd\u8c37 \u771f|Takiya Makoto}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]]|Jeff Johnson<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n:Kobayashi's co-worker who is initially believed by Tohru to be a rival for Kobayashi's affections, but is really just an [[otaku]] who thinks of Kobayashi as \"one of the guys\" and likes to talk about maids with her. Kobayashi helps him set up during [[Comiket]] every year. Fafnir eventually decides to live with him in the human world due to his enormous game and manga collection.\n;{{nihongo|Riko Saikawa|\u624d\u5ddd \u30ea\u30b3|Saikawa Riko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]]|Sara Ragsdale}}\n:Kanna's primary school classmate who is initially hostile towards her but soon develops a crush on her. A running gag involves her becoming overwhelmingly flushed with bliss every time she and Kanna make physical contact.\n;{{nihongo|Georgie Saikawa|\u624d\u5ddd \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc|Saikawa J\u014dj\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuko Goto]]|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:Riko's older sister who pretends to be a housemaid as her hobby and thus gets on very well with Kobayashi.\n;{{nihongo|Shouta Magatsuchi|\u771f\u30f6\u571f \u7fd4\u592a|Magatsuchi Sh\u014dta}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Ishihara]]|[[Alison Viktorin]]}}\n:A young mage who Lucoa starts living with after she interrupted his summoning spell. He is convinced that Lucoa is a succubus, and though she tries to clear the misunderstanding, her overly familiar antics do little to help her case. A running gag involves him blushing and running away every time he makes contact with Lucoa's impressive bust and scolding her as a \"bad demon\". In the anime, he is in fifth grade at the school Riko and Kanna attend. His father is the director of Kobayashi's company, who designed their [[programming language]] based on magic from the other world, and keeps tabs on Tohru and Kobayashi for the Emperor of Demise.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n[[Coolkyousinnjya]] began publishing the series in the first issue of [[Futabasha]]'s ''Monthly Action'' magazine on 25 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web

After bonding with each other over drinks and realizing they were both alone, Kobayashi invited Tohru to stay with her as a maid. Later, Tohru tells Kobayashi about a human bandit she had met while in the dragon world, who influenced her to choose her own freedom and become a maid. Meanwhile, another dragon enters the human world.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| Title           = Emperor of Demise Arrives!

The series began serialization in [[Futabasha]]'s ''Monthly Action'' magazine in May 2013, and is licensed in North America by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]]. Two spin-off manga, one by Mitsuhiro Kimura and the other by Ayami Kazama, are serialized in ''Monthly Action''. An [[anime]] television series produced by [[Kyoto Animation]] aired in Japan between January and April 2017. A second anime season has been greenlit.\n\n==Plot==\nAs office worker Kobayashi gets ready for work, she is greeted by a large dragon right outside her front door. The dragon immediately transforms into a human girl in a [[French maid|maid outfit]], and introduces herself as Tohru. It turns out that during a drunken excursion into the mountains the night before, Kobayashi had encountered the dragon, who claims to have come from another world. Subsequently, Kobayashi had removed a holy sword from Tohru's back, earning her gratitude. With Tohru having no place to stay, Kobayashi offers to let the dragon stay at her home and become her personal maid, to which she agrees. Despite being efficient at housework, Tohru's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up scaring Kobayashi and bringing more trouble than help. Additionally, Tohru's presence attracts other dragons, gods, and mythical beings to her new home.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n;{{Nihongo|Kobayashi|\u5c0f\u6797}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mutsumi Tamura]]<ref name=ann/>|[[Leah Clark]]<ref name=\"dub cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/01/03/official-winter-2017-simuldub-lineup/#dragon|title=Official Winter 2017 Simuldub Linup - Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid|publisher=[[Funimation]]|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>}}\n:A normal programmer and office worker who suddenly finds herself living with a [[dragon]] after removing a divine sword from it on a drunken night.

After her life is saved by Kobayashi, she falls in love with her and starts living in her flat as a maid.<ref name=\"SSE\" /> She usually retains her horns when changing into human shape, and occasionally retains her tail. She is commonly mistaken for a [[cosplay]]er due to her appearance. A [[running gag]] involves her attempting to feed Kobayashi pieces of her tail (which she can regenerate) with her cooking as a sign of affection and a sign of love.\n;{{nihongo|Kanna Kamui|\u30ab\u30f3\u30ca\u30ab\u30e0\u30a4}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Maria Naganawa]]<ref name=ann/>|[[Jad Saxton]]<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n:Tohru's friend from the dragon realm who was exiled from her world for pulling too many pranks on other dragons and wound up living with Kobayashi as well. Although she is much older than she appears, she is very young by dragon standards, equivalent to a primary school student at {{Nihongo|Oborozuka Elementary School|\u6727\u30ba\u30ab \u5c0f\u5b66\u6821|Oborozuka Sh\u014dgakk\u014d}}, which she attends as a third grade student bearing Kobayashi's surname. She initially assumes that Kobayashi seduced Tohru into staying and wanted her to return to their original world. She grows increasingly attached to Kobayashi as the series progresses, viewing her as a mother figure. Kanna's basis and tribal attire are inspired by [[Kamuy|the culture of the]] [[Ainu people|indigenous natives of Hokkaido]] and claims to be from [[Ushishir]]. She bears feather-like horns and a thin tail ending in a bulb, and is capable of recharging her depleted magical energy with electricity.\n\n===Dragons===\n;{{nihongo|Elma|\u30a8\u30eb\u30de|Eruma}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Takada]]<ref name=ann/>|Rachel Glass}}\n:A [[Leviathan|water dragon]] belonging to the Order faction, rival to Tohru's Chaos faction, who ends up working alongside Kobayashi at her office after getting stuck in the human world. She is as powerful as she is diligent and driven, but also naive, indecisive, and easily swayed by food (primarily sweets) due to her low income. Her human form is distinguished by purple hair, a horn (which she hides for work), her habit of having a jacket or kimono hanging off her shoulder, and wielding a trident;  {{nihongo|Elma Joui|\u4e0a\u4e95 \u30a8\u30eb\u30de|J\u014di Eruma}} is the identity she uses while in Kobayashi's workplace.\n; {{nihongo|Lucoa|\u30eb\u30b3\u30a2|Rukoa}} {{anchor|Quetzalcoatl}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Minami Takahashi (voice actress)|Minami Takahashi]]<ref name=ann/>|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n: {{nihongo|Quetzalcoatl|\u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb\u30b3\u30a2\u30c8\u30eb|Ketsarukoatoru}} is an [[Aztec]] dragon goddess and another friend of Tohru, who lost her divine status centuries ago after getting drunk and causing a scandal involving her younger sister, much like the [[Quetzalcoatl]] of the original mythology. She is often referred to as Lucoa (from \"lcoa\" of the deity's name as adapted to the [[Kana|Japanese syllabary]]) and Tohru sees her as a source of wisdom but will sometimes casually reference the events in her past, much to Lucoa's embarrassment. She lives with Shouta after she interrupted his summoning spell to prevent him from summoning a dangerous demon, causing him to mistakenly believe she is a [[succubus]]. Lucoa appears in her human form as a tall, well-endowed woman with striking [[heterochromia]]. She often becomes overly affectionate with Shouta, scaring him, and having others mark her as a pervert. She tends to wear tight-fitting clothing that shows a lot of skin, and a running gag involves her showing up to a public place only to be dragged away by a staff member for being dressed inappropriately.\n;{{nihongo|Fafnir|\u30d5\u30a1\u30d5\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb|Fafun\u012bru}} {{anchor|Takeshi Ooyama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Ono]]|Garret Storms<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n:Another old friend of Tohru, he is a male dragon with a strong distrust for humans which leads to him questioning much of Tohru's actions and ideals in his earlier appearances. He shares some resemblance to the traits of [[Fafnir|his namesake]], such as his cold demeanour and disdainful mentality. He appears as a refined young man with long black hair and red eyes in his human form. After Tohru's attempts to find him a place to stay (under the name {{nihongo|Takeshi Ooyama|\u5927\u5c71 \u731b|\u014cyama Takeshi}}), Fafnir eventually comes to live with Takiya, becoming obsessed with video games and [[popular culture]].\n;{{nihongo|Ilulu|\u30a4\u30eb\u30eb|Iruru}}\n:A Chaos faction dragon who targets Tohru because of her relationship with a human, attempting to destroy the city in the process. She then turns her eye to Kobayashi, trying to drive her and Tohru apart to prove her beliefs, but after Kobayashi and Tohru save her from an Order dragon she has a change of heart and ends up living with them. Ilulu appears in her human form as a petite girl with a very ample bust. Her mental growth was somewhat impaired due to various beliefs that were forced on her by other chaos dragons. When she was younger, she enjoyed playing with human children, and since coming to Earth, she has taken up a job at a candy store, so that she can still see children when they are happy. \n;{{nihongo|Damocles, the Emperor of Demise|\u7d42\u7109\u5e1d|Sh\u016bentei}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takayuki Sug\u014d]]|John McCalmont}}\n:Tohru's father, who disapproves of Tohru's relationship with Kobayashi due to their beliefs as Chaos dragons and because of a non-interference rule about Earth. He attempts to force Tohru to leave with him but decides to let her stay after Kobayashi stands up to him, despite knowing how easily he could kill her. He still leaves Kobayashi alive, as he does not want to risk angering Tohru, who he recognizes as stronger than him.\n\n===Humans===\n;{{nihongo|Makoto Takiya|\u6edd\u8c37 \u771f|Takiya Makoto}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]]|Jeff Johnson<ref name=\"dub cast\" />}}\n:Kobayashi's co-worker who is initially believed by Tohru to be a rival for Kobayashi's affections, but is really just an [[otaku]] who thinks of Kobayashi as \"one of the guys\" and likes to talk about maids with her. Kobayashi helps him set up during [[Comiket]] every year. Fafnir eventually decides to live with him in the human world due to his enormous game and manga collection.\n;{{nihongo|Riko Saikawa|\u624d\u5ddd \u30ea\u30b3|Saikawa Riko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]]|Sara Ragsdale}}\n:Kanna's primary school classmate who is initially hostile towards her but soon develops a crush on her. A running gag involves her becoming overwhelmingly flushed with bliss every time she and Kanna make physical contact.\n;{{nihongo|Georgie Saikawa|\u624d\u5ddd \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc|Saikawa J\u014dj\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuko Goto]]|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:Riko's older sister who pretends to be a housemaid as her hobby and thus gets on very well with Kobayashi.\n;{{nihongo|Shouta Magatsuchi|\u771f\u30f6\u571f \u7fd4\u592a|Magatsuchi Sh\u014dta}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Ishihara]]|[[Alison Viktorin]]}}\n:A young mage who Lucoa starts living with after she interrupted his summoning spell. He is convinced that Lucoa is a succubus, and though she tries to clear the misunderstanding, her overly familiar antics do little to help her case. A running gag involves him blushing and running away every time he makes contact with Lucoa's impressive bust and scolding her as a \"bad demon\". In the anime, he is in fifth grade at the school Riko and Kanna attend. His father is the director of Kobayashi's company, who designed their [[programming language]] based on magic from the other world, and keeps tabs on Tohru and Kobayashi for the Emperor of Demise.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n[[Coolkyousinnjya]] began publishing the series in the first issue of [[Futabasha]]'s ''Monthly Action'' magazine on 25 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web

As Kobayashi goes to work the next day, Tohru stays to watch over her apartment, defending it from two burglars. Later, Tohru becomes jealous of Kobayashi's co-worker, Makoto Takiya, only to find he is nothing more than a drinking buddy and fellow maid otaku.

Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the [[Church of Satan]] in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various [[Christianity|Christian]] groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the [[Devil in popular culture|concept of Satan]], has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\n\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the [[Inquisition]] attached to the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Cathars]], performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent [[Early Modern period]], belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in [[Witch trials in the early modern period|mass trials of alleged witches]] across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as [[Protestantism]] (and conversely, the [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]) and the [[French Revolution]] continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential [[Taxil hoax]] of France in the 1890s, which claimed that [[Freemasonry]] worshiped Satan, [[Lucifer]], and [[Baphomet]] in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\n\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]], viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a [[patriarch]]. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n \nContemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.<ref name=\"crsi\">{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}</ref> The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.<ref name=\"crsi\" /> Satanism started to reach [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.<ref name=\"crs8\">{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |work= BBC News |date= 2000-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|224px|''[[Wolfgang of Regensburg|Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'', by [[Michael Pacher]].]]\n\nIn their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal, [[James R.

in this context, it appears at several points in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=19}} For instance, in the [[Book of Samuel]], [[David]] is presented as the satan (\"adversary\") of the [[Philistines]], while in the [[Book of Numbers]] the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to ''satan'' (\"to oppose\") [[Balaam]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=51}} Prior to the composition of the [[New Testament]], the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebeled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the [[Book of Enoch]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=52}} This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit [[sin]]; in the [[Book of Matthew]] and the [[Book of Luke]], he attempted to tempt [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the latter fasted in the wilderness.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=53}}\n\nThe word \"Satanism\" was adopted into English from the [[French language|French]] ''satanisme''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} The terms \"Satanism\" and \"Satanist\" are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the sixteenth century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}} In a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] tract of 1565, the author condemns the \"heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes [sic]\" of the [[Protestantism|Protestants]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} In an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] work of 1559, [[Anabaptists]] and other Protestant sects are condemned as \"swarmes of Satanistes [sic]\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} As used in this manner, the term \"Satanism\" was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but rather presented the view that through deviating from what the speaker or writer regarded as the true variant of Christianity, they were regarded as being essentially in league with the [[devil]]. {{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} During the nineteenth century, the term \"Satanism\" began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} and it was only in the late nineteenth century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the [[Swedish language]]; the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Bishop [[Laurentius Paulinus Gothus]] had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as ''Sathanister'' in his ''Ethica Christiana'', produced between 1615 and 1630.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n== Antagonism towards Satanism ==\n<!-- Groups or individuals alleged to have practiced Satanism before the appearance of modern Satanism in the 1960s -->\n\nHistorical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=13\u201314}} This commonly involves a belief in [[witchcraft|witches]], a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in [[incest]], [[murder]], and [[cannibalism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=14}} Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}} For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}}\n\nAnother contributing factor to the idea of Satanism is the concept that there is an agent of misfortune and evil who operates on a cosmic scale,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=19}} something usually associated with a strong form of ethical dualism that divides the world clearly into forces of good and forces of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=20}} The earliest such entity known is [[Angra Mainyu]], a figure that appears in the Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=19|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=18}} This concept was also embraced by [[Judaism]] and early Christianity, and although it was soon marginalized within Jewish thought, it gained increasing importance within early Christian understandings of the cosmos.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=21}} While the early Christian idea of the Devil was not well developed, it gradually adapted and expanded through the creation of folklore, art, theological treatises, and morality tales, thus providing the character with a range of extra-Biblical associations.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n===Medieval and Early Modern Christendom===\n\n[[File:Praetorius Blocksberg.jpg|thumb|Title illustration of [[Johannes Praetorius (writer)]] ''Blocksbergs Verrichtung'' (1668) showing many traditional features of the medieval [[Witches' Sabbath]]]]\n{{See also|European witchcraft|Maleficium (sorcery)|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nAs Christianity expanded throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and Europe, it came into contact with a variety of other religions, which it regarded as \"[[paganism|pagan]]\". Christian theologians claimed that the gods and goddesses venerated by these \"pagans\" were not genuine divinities, but were actually demons.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=23}} However, they did not believe that \"pagans\" were deliberately devil-worshippers, instead claiming that they were simply misguided.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}} In Christian iconography, the Devil and demons were given the physical traits of figures from [[Classical mythology]] such as the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[faun]]s, and [[satyr]]s.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}}\n\nThose Christian groups regarded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were treated differently, with theologians arguing that they were deliberately worshipping the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=24\u201326}} This was accompanied by claims that such individuals engaged in incestuous sexual orgies, murdered infants, and committed acts of [[cannibalism]], all stock accusations that had previously been leveled at Christians themselves in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=25\u201326}}\nThe first recorded example of such an accusation being made within [[Western Christianity]] took place in [[Toulouse]] in 1022, when two clerics were tried for allegedly venerating a demon.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=25}} Throughout the middle ages, this accusation would be applied to a wide range of Christian heretical groups, including the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomils]], [[Cathars]], [[Waldensians]], and the [[Hussites]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=28}} The [[Knights Templar]] were accused of worshipping an [[Cult image|idol]] known as [[Baphomet]], with Lucifer having appeared at their meetings in the form of a cat.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=126}} As well as these Christian groups, these claims were also made about Europe's Jewish community.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=28\u201329}} In the thirteenth century, there were also references made to a group of \"Luciferians\" led by a woman named Lucardis which hoped to see Satan rule in Heaven. References to this group continued into the fourteenth century, although historians studying the allegations concur that these Luciferians were likely a fictitious invention.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=29\u201331}}\n\nWithin Christian thought, the idea developed that certain individuals could make [[Deal with the Devil|a pact with Satan]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=57}} This may have emerged after observing that pacts with gods and goddesses played a role in various pre-Christian belief systems, or that such pacts were also made as part of the Christian cult of saints.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=58}} Another possibility is that it derives from a misunderstanding of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s condemnation of [[augury]] in his ''[[On the Christian Doctrine]]'', written in the late fourth century. Here, he stated that people who consulted augurs were entering \"''quasi pacts''\" (covenants) with demons.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=57\u201358}} The idea of the diabolical pact made with demons was popularized across Europe in the story of [[Faust]], likely based in part on the real life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving15.jpg|thumb|left|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]'s ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]\n\nAs the late medieval gave way to the [[early modern period]], European Christendom experienced a schism between the established [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the breakaway [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement. In the ensuing [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], both Catholics and Protestants accused each other of deliberately being in league with Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=35}} It was in this context that the terms \"Satanist\" and \"Satanism\" emerged.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}}\n\nThe early modern period also saw fear of Satanists reach its \"historical apogee\" in the form of the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}} This came about as the accusations which had been leveled at medieval heretics, among them that of devil-worship, were applied to the pre-existing idea of [[European witchcraft|the witch]], or practitioner of malevolent [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=133|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=37}} The idea of a conspiracy of Satanic witches was developed by educated elites, although the concept of malevolent witchcraft was a widespread part of popular belief and [[folklore|folkloric]] ideas about the [[night witch]], the [[wild hunt]], and the dance of the fairies were incorporated into it.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=38}} The earliest trials took place in Northern Italy and France, before spreading it out to other areas of Europe and to Britain's North American colonies, being carried out by the legal authorities in both Catholic and Protestant regions.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}}\nBetween 30,000 and 50,000 individuals were executed as accused Satanic witches.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=36}}\nMost historians agree that the majority of those persecuted in these witch trials were innocent of any involvement in Devil worship.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=70}} However, in their summary of the evidence for the trials, the historians Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow thought it \"without doubt\" that some of those accused in the trials had been guilty of employing magic in an attempt to harm their enemies, and were thus genuinely guilty of witchcraft.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=2}}\n\nIn seventeenth-century Sweden, a number of highway robbers and other outlaws living in the forests informed judges that they venerated Satan because he provided more practical assistance than God.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=44\u201345}}\nThe historian of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] regarded these practices as \"folkloric Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n===18th to 20th century Christendom===\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, gentleman's social clubs became increasingly prominent in Britain and Ireland, among the most secretive of which were the [[Hellfire Clubs]], which were first reported in the 1720s.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1pp=58\u201359|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=66}} The most famous of these groups was the [[Order of the Knights of Saints Francis]], which was founded circa 1750 by the aristocrat [[Sir Francis Dashwood]] and which assembled first at his estate at [[West Wycombe]] and later in [[Medmenham Abbey]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=66\u201367}} A number of contemporary press sources portrayed these as gatherings of [[atheism|atheist]] [[Rake (character)|rakes]] where Christianity was mocked and toasts were made to the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=66}} Beyond these sensationalist accounts, which may not be accurate portrayals of actual events, little is known about the activities of the Hellfire Clubs.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=66}} Introvigne suggested that they may have engaged in a form of \"playful Satanism\" in which Satan was invoked \"to show a daring contempt for conventional morality\" by individuals who neither believed in his literal existence nor wanted to pay homage to him.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|Stanislas de Guaita drew the original goat pentagram, which first appeared in the book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' in 1897. This symbol would later become synonymous with [[Baphomet]], and is commonly referred to as the Sabbatic Goat.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] of 1789 dealt a blow to the hegemony of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in parts of Europe, and soon a number of Catholic authors began making claims that it had been masterminded by a conspiratorial group of Satanists.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=71}} Among the first to do so was French Catholic priest [[Jean-Baptiste Fiard]], who publicly claimed that a wide range of individuals, from the [[Jacobins]] to [[tarot|tarot card readers]], were part of a Satanic conspiracy.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=71\u201373}} Fiard's ideas were furthered by [[Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier]], who devoted a lengthy book to this [[conspiracy theory]]; he claimed that Satanists had supernatural powers allowing them to curse people and to shapeshift into both cats and fleas.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=74\u201378}} Although most of his contemporaries regarded Berbiguier as mad,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=84\u201385}} his ideas gained credence among many occultists, including [[Stanislas de Guaita]], a [[Christian Cabala|Cabalist]] who used them for the basis of his book, ''The Temple of Satan''.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, the British novelist [[Dennis Wheatley]] produced a range of influential novels in which his protagonists battled Satanic groups.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=266\u2013267}} At the same time, non-fiction authors like [[Montague Summers]] and [[Rollo Ahmed]] published books claiming that Satanic groups practicing black magic were still active across the world, although they provided no evidence that this was the case.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=141\u2013142}} During the 1950s, various British tabloid newspapers repeated such claims, largely basing their accounts on the allegations of one woman, Sarah Jackson, who claimed to have been a member of such a group.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=143\u2013149}} In 1973, the British Christian [[Doreen Irvine]] published ''From Witchcraft to Christ'', in which she claimed to have been a member of a Satanic group that gave her supernatural powers, such as the ability to [[levitation|levitate]], before she escaped and embraced Christianity.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=159\u2013161}}\nIn the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, various Christian preachers\u2014the most famous being [[Mike Warnke]] in his 1972 book ''The Satan-Seller''\u2014claimed that they had been members of Satanic groups who carried out sex rituals and animal sacrifices before discovering Christianity.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=164\u2013170}} According to Gareth Medway in his historical examination of Satanism, these stories were \"a series of inventions by insecure people and hack writers, each one based on a previous story, exaggerated a little more each time\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=161}}\n\nOther publications made allegations of Satanism against historical figures. The 1970s saw the publication of the Romanian Protestant preacher [[Richard Wurmbrand]]'s book in which he argued\u2014without corroborating evidence\u2014that the socio-political theorist [[Karl Marx]] had been a Satanist.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1pp=262\u2013263|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=66}}\n\n===Satanic ritual abuse hysteria===\n{{main|Satanic ritual abuse}}\n\nAt the end of the twentieth century, a [[moral panic]] developed around claims regarding a Devil-worshipping cult that made use of sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism in its rituals, with children being among its victims.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=13}} Initially, the alleged perpetrators of such crimes were labeled \"witches\", although the term \"Satanist\" was soon adopted as a favored alternative,{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=13}} and the phenomenon itself came to be called \"the Satanism Scare\".{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Promoters of the claims alleged that there was a conspiracy of organized Satanists who occupied prominent positions throughout society, from the police to politicians, and that they had been powerful enough to cover up their crimes.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=2016|1p=13|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=381}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Preceded by some significant but isolated episodes in the 1970s, a great Satanism scare exploded in the 1980s in the United States and Canada and was subsequently exported towards England, Australia, and other countries.

in similar allegations being made in various other parts of the United States.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=183}}\n\nA prominent aspect of the Satanic Scare was the claim by those in the developing \"anti-Satanism\" movement that any child's claim about Satanic ritual abuse must be true, because children would not lie.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=16}} Although some involved in the anti-Satanism movement were from Jewish and secular backgrounds,{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=369|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=15}} a central part was played by fundamentalist and evangelical forms of Christianity, in particular [[Pentecostalism]], with Christian groups holding conferences and producing books and videotapes to promote belief in the conspiracy.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Various figures in law enforcement also came to be promoters of the conspiracy theory, with such \"cult cops\" holding various conferences to promote it.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=191\u2013195}} The scare was later imported to

following increasing skepticism about such allegations,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=210\u2013211}} and a number of those who had been convicted of perpetrating Satanic ritual abuse saw their convictions overturned.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}}\nIn 1990, an agent of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Ken Lanning]], revealed that he had investigated 300 allegations of Satanic ritual abuse and

century, the character of Satan was increasingly rendered unimportant in Western philosophy and ignored in Christian theology, while in folklore he came to be seen as a foolish rather than a menacing figure.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} The development of new values in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]\u2014in particular those of [[reason]] and [[individualism]]\u2014contributed to a shift

him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe shifting view of Satan owes many of its origins to [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=28|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=70}}

his own pride who rebeled against God he humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} This was how Milton's Satan was understood by later readers like the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1pp=28, 30|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=69\u201370}} and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher [[William Godwin]], who reflected it in his 1793 book ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} ''Paradise Lost'' gained a wide readership in the eighteenth century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=70}} Milton thus became \"a central character in rewriting Satanism\" and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a \"''de facto'' Satanist\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of what has been termed \"literary Satanism\" or \"romantic Satanism\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} According to Van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a \"coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a ''post factum'' identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}} For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=69}} with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many [[romanticism|romanticist]] and [[Decadent movement|decadent]] figures.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}} For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a \"strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}}\n\nAmong the romanticist poets to adopt this view of Satan was the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who had been influenced by Milton.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=71\u201372}} In his poem ''[[Laon and Cythna]]'', Shelley praised the \"Serpent\", a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=97\u201398}}\nAnother was Shelley's fellow British poet [[Lord Byron]], who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work ''[[Eloa]]'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=74\u201375}} Satan was also adopted by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'', in which he outlined his own [[cosmogony]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=105\u2013107}}\nAlthough the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus it is problematic to regard them as religious Satanists.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}}\n\nRadical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u201383 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789\u201399, and the figure of Satan, who was interpreted as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by God, was an appealing one for many of the radical leftists of the period.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=77\u201379}} For them, Satan was \"a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}} The French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=117\u2013119}} Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian [[Mikhail Bakunin]], similarly described the figure of Satan as \"the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds\" in his book ''[[God and the State]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=119\u2013120}} These ideas likely inspired the American [[feminism|feminist]] activist [[Moses Harman]] to name his anarchist periodical ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} The idea of this \"Leftist Satan\" declined during the twentieth century,{{sfn|Van

Satanism and witchcraft in their work.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=462\u2013463}} References to Satan also appeared in the work of those rock bands which were pioneering the [[Heavy metal music|heavy

Christians and other lyrics affirmed the power of the Christian God over Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=467\u2013468}} In the 1980s, greater use of Satanic imagery was made by heavy metal bands like [[Slayer]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=468}} Bands active in the subgenre of [[death metal]]\u2014among them [[Deicide

come to be more closely associated with the subgenre of [[black metal]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=467}} in which it was foregrounded over the other themes that had been used in death metal.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=469}} A number of black metal performers incorporated self-injury into their act, framing this as a manifestation of Satanic devotion.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=469}} The

black metal act to more seriously adopt Satanism was [[Mercyful Fate]], whose vocalist, [[King Diamond]], joined the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=471}} More often than not musicians associating themselves with black metal say they do not believe in legitimate Satanic ideology and often profess to being atheists, agnostics, or [[Religious skepticism|religious

Diamond, various black metal Satanists sought to distance themselves from LaVeyan Satanism, for instance by referring to their beliefs as \"devil worship\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} These individuals regarded Satan as a literal entity,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=479}} and in contrast to LaVey's views, they associated Satanism with criminality, suicide, and terror.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} For them, Christianity was regarded as a plague which required eradication.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=482}} Many of these individuals\u2014such as [[Varg Vikernes]] and [[Euronymous]]\u2014were Norwegian,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=479\u2013481}} and influenced by the strong anti-Christian views of this milieu, between 1992 and 1996 around fifty Norwegian churches were destroyed in arson attacks.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=481}} Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from [[Heathenry (new religious

exist in a single form, as there are multiple different religious Satanisms, each with different ideas about what being a Satanist entails.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=3}} The historian of

set of features that were common to the groups in this Satanic milieu: these were the positive use of the term \"Satanist\" as a designation, an emphasis on individualism, a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, a transgressive and antinomian stance, a self-perception as an elite, and an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=7&ndash;9}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argued that the groups within the Satanic milieu could be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They saw reactive Satanism as encompassing \"popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic rebellion\" and noted that it situates itself in opposition to society while at the same time conforming to society's perspective of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} Rationalist Satanism is used to describe the trend in the Satanic milieu which is [[atheism|atheistic]], [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]], [[materialism|materialistic]], and [[epicurean]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}} Esoteric Satanism instead applied to those forms which are [[theism|theistic]] and draw upon ideas from other forms of [[Western esotericism]],

wanted to use the term \"Lucifer\" without adopting the term \"Satan\" in a similar way.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=37}} The early [[Theosophical Society]] held to the view that \"Lucifer\" was a force that aided humanity's awakening to its own spiritual nature.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=37\u201338}} In keeping with this view, the Society began production of a journal titled ''Lucifer''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=38}}\n\n\"Satan\" was also used within the esoteric system propounded by the Danish occultist [[Carl William Hansen]], who used the pen name \"Ben Kadosh\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=38}} Hansen was involved in a variety of esoteric groups, including [[Martinism]], [[Freemasonry]], and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], drawing on ideas

Luciferianism is often identified as an auxiliary creed or movement of Satanism, due to the common identification of Lucifer with Satan. Some Luciferians accept this identification and/or consider Lucifer as the \"light bearer\" and illuminated aspect of Satan, giving them the name of Satanists and the right to bear the title. Others reject it, giving the argument that Lucifer is a more positive and easy-going ideal than Satan. They are inspired by the ancient myths of [[Egyptian mythology|Egypt]], [[Roman mythology|Rome]] and [[Greek mythology|Greece]], [[Gnosticism]] and traditional Western occultism.\n\n==== Order of Nine Angles ====\n{{Main|Order of Nine Angles}}\n[[File:Ona.svg|thumb|right|One of the principal symbols of the ONA]]\n\nAccording to the group's own claims, the Order of Nine Angles was established in [[Shropshire]], Western England during the late 1960s, when a Grand Mistress united a number of ancient pagan groups active in the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}}\nThis account states that when the Order's Grand Mistress migrated to Australia, a man known as \"Anton Long\" took over as the new Grand Master.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} From 1976 onward he authored an array of texts for the tradition, codifying and extending its teachings, mythos, and structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=87}}\nVarious academics have argued that Long is the pseudonym of British neo-Nazi activist [[David Myatt]],{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=216|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=268|3a1=Faxneld|3y=2013a|3p=207}} an allegation that Myatt has denied.{{sfnm|1a1=Ryan|1y=2003|1p=53|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=267}}\nThe ONA arose to public attention in the early 1980s,{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} spreading its message through magazine articles over the following two decades.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} In 2000, it established a presence on the internet,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} later adopting [[social media]] to promote its message.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}}\n\nThe ONA is a secretive organization,{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}} and lacks any central administration, instead operating as a network of allied Satanic practitioners, which it terms the \"kollective\".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} It consists largely of autonomous [[Covert cell|cells]] known as \"nexions\".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} The majority of these are located in Britain, Ireland, and Germany, although others are located elsewhere in Europe, and in Russia, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and the United States.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}\n\nThe ONA describe their occultism as \"Traditional Satanism\".{{sfnm|1a1=Faxneld|1y=2013a|1p=207|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013b|2p=88|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=250|4a1=Sieg|4y=2013|4p=252}} The ONA's writings encourage human sacrifice,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=218&ndash;219|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} referring to their victims as ''opfers''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} According to the Order's teachings, such opfers must demonstrate character faults that mark them out as being worthy of death,{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=54}} and accordingly the ONA insists that children must never be victims.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=292|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2000|2p=237}} No ONA cell have admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritualized manner, but rather Order members have joined the police and military in order to carry out such killings.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=114}} Faxneld described the Order as \"a dangerous and extreme form of Satanism\",{{sfn|Faxneld|2013a|p=207}} while religious studies scholar Graham Harvey claimed that the ONA fit the stereotype of the Satanist \"better than other groups\" by embracing \"deeply shocking\" and illegal acts.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=292}}\n\n==== Temple of Set ====\n{{Main|Temple of Set}}\nThe Temple of Set is an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[occult]] society claiming to be the world's leading [[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|left-hand path]] religious organization.

They described this as an adolescent and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] means of rebeling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They believed that there were two tendencies within reactive Satanism: one, \"Satanic tourism\", was characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved, while the other, the \"Satanic quest\", was typified by a longer and deeper involvement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}}\n\nThe researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had [[psychic]] powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]]kian.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\nSome reactive Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=130}} During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} Introvigne expressed the view that these incidents were \"more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} In a few cases the crimes of these reactive Satanists have included murder. In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers\u2014one led by Stanley Baker in [[Big Sur]] and the other by Steven Hurd in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}} In 1984, a U.S. group called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group's illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers' death was a sacrifice to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}}\nThe American serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] for instance claimed that he was a Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out \"Hail Satan!\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=122}}\n\n===Demographics===\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was \"heavily dominated by young males\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=158}} Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=146}} Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=142}} Others have stated that they had experiences with [[supernatural]] phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}} A number reported feelings of anger at the hypocrisy of many practicing Christians and expressed the view that the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Gods of Christianity and other religions are unethical, citing issues such as the [[problem of evil]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=202\u2013204}} For some practitioners, Satanism gave a sense of hope, including for those who had been physically and sexually abused.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=179\u2013180}} Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were [[reincarnation]] and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=181\u2013182}} The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=183}} although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=209}} A number described performing [[curse|cursing]], in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=210\u2013212}}\nMost practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=151, 153}} Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=153}}\nFrom their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=157}} A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=159}} A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=160}} When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=171}} A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right; conversely, over two-thirds expressed negative or extremely negative views about [[Nazism]] and [[neo-Nazism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}}\n\n===Legal recognition===\n\nIn 2004 it was claimed that Satanism was allowed in the [[British Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] of the [[British Armed Forces]], despite opposition from Christians.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] [[CNN]]</ref><ref>Carter, Helen.

Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the [[Church of Satan]] in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various [[Christianity|Christian]] groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the [[Devil in popular culture|concept of Satan]], has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\n\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the [[Inquisition]] attached to the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Cathars]], performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent [[Early Modern period]], belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in [[Witch trials in the early modern period|mass trials of alleged witches]] across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as [[Protestantism]] (and conversely, the [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]) and the [[French Revolution]] continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential [[Taxil hoax]] of France in the 1890s, which claimed that [[Freemasonry]] worshiped Satan, [[Lucifer]], and [[Baphomet]] in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\n\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]], viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a [[patriarch]]. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n \nContemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.<ref name=\"crsi\">{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}</ref> The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.<ref name=\"crsi\" /> Satanism started to reach [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.<ref name=\"crs8\">{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |work= BBC News |date= 2000-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|224px|''[[Wolfgang of Regensburg|Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'', by [[Michael Pacher]].]]\n\nIn their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal, [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], and Jesper Aa. Petersen stated that the term ''Satanism'' \"has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for '[[othering]]'\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=7}} The concept of Satanism is an invention of Christianity, for it relies upon the figure of Satan, a character deriving from [[Christian mythology]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=16}}\n\nElsewhere, Petersen noted that \"Satanism as something others do is very different from Satanism as a self-designation\".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=92}}\nEugene Gallagher noted that, as commonly used, ''Satanism'' was usually \"a [[polemical]], not a descriptive term\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2006|p=151}}\n\nIn 1994, the Italian sociologist [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested to define Satanism with the simultaneous presence of \"1) the worship of the character identified with the name of Satan or Lucifer in the Bible, 2) by organized groups with at least a minimal organization and hierarchy, 3) through ritual or liturgical practices.\" The definition applies regardless the way in which \"each group perceives Satan, as personal or impersonal, real or symbolical.<ref>{{cite book | first = Massimo | last1 = Introvigne | author-link = Massimo Introvigne | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=nt8zDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 | title = Satanism: A Social History | publisher = Brill | date = September 29, 2016 | language = en | access-date = February 20, 2020 | location = \tLeiden ;

in this context, it appears at several points in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=19}} For instance, in the [[Book of Samuel]], [[David]] is presented as the satan (\"adversary\") of the [[Philistines]], while in the [[Book of Numbers]] the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to ''satan'' (\"to oppose\") [[Balaam]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=51}} Prior to the composition of the [[New Testament]], the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebeled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the [[Book of Enoch]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=52}} This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit [[sin]]; in the [[Book of Matthew]] and the [[Book of Luke]], he attempted to tempt [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the latter fasted in the wilderness.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=53}}\n\nThe word \"Satanism\" was adopted into English from the [[French language|French]] ''satanisme''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} The terms \"Satanism\" and \"Satanist\" are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the sixteenth century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}} In a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] tract of 1565, the author condemns the \"heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes [sic]\" of the [[Protestantism|Protestants]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} In an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] work of 1559, [[Anabaptists]] and other Protestant sects are condemned as \"swarmes of Satanistes [sic]\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} As used in this manner, the term \"Satanism\" was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but rather presented the view that through deviating from what the speaker or writer regarded as the true variant of Christianity, they were regarded as being essentially in league with the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} During the nineteenth century, the term \"Satanism\" began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} and it was only in the late nineteenth century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the [[Swedish language]]; the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Bishop [[Laurentius Paulinus Gothus]] had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as ''Sathanister'' in his ''Ethica Christiana'', produced between 1615 and 1630.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n== Antagonism towards Satanism ==\n<!-- Groups or individuals alleged to have practiced Satanism before the appearance of modern Satanism in the 1960s -->\n\nHistorical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=13\u201314}} This commonly involves a belief in [[witchcraft|witches]], a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in [[incest]], [[murder]], and [[cannibalism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=14}} Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}} For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}}\n\nAnother contributing factor to the idea of Satanism is the concept that there is an agent of misfortune and evil who operates on a cosmic scale,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=19}} something usually associated with a strong form of ethical dualism that divides the world clearly into forces of good and forces of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=20}} The earliest such entity known is [[Angra Mainyu]], a figure that appears in the Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=19|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=18}} This concept was also embraced by [[Judaism]] and early Christianity, and although it was soon marginalized within Jewish thought, it gained increasing importance within early Christian understandings of the cosmos.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=21}} While the early Christian idea of the Devil was not well developed, it gradually adapted and expanded through the creation of folklore, art, theological treatises, and morality tales, thus providing the character with a range of extra-Biblical associations.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n===Medieval and Early Modern Christendom===\n\n[[File:Praetorius Blocksberg.jpg|thumb|Title illustration of [[Johannes Praetorius (writer)]] ''Blocksbergs Verrichtung'' (1668) showing many traditional features of the medieval [[Witches' Sabbath]]]]\n{{See also|European witchcraft|Maleficium (sorcery)|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nAs Christianity expanded throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and Europe, it came into contact with a variety of other religions, which it regarded as \"[[paganism|pagan]]\". Christian theologians claimed that the gods and goddesses venerated by these \"pagans\" were not genuine divinities, but were actually demons.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=23}} However, they did not believe that \"pagans\" were deliberately devil-worshippers, instead claiming that they were simply misguided.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}} In Christian iconography, the Devil and demons were given the physical traits of figures from [[Classical mythology]] such as the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[faun]]s, and [[satyr]]s.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}}\n\nThose Christian groups regarded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were treated differently, with theologians arguing that they were deliberately worshipping the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=24\u201326}} This was accompanied by claims that such individuals engaged in incestuous sexual orgies, murdered infants, and committed acts of [[cannibalism]], all stock accusations that had previously been leveled at Christians themselves in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=25\u201326}}\nThe first recorded example of such an accusation being made within [[Western Christianity]] took place in [[Toulouse]] in 1022, when two clerics were tried for allegedly venerating a demon.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=25}} Throughout the middle ages, this accusation would be applied to a wide range of Christian heretical groups, including the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomils]], [[Cathars]], [[Waldensians]], and the [[Hussites]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=28}} The [[Knights Templar]] were accused of worshipping an [[Cult image|idol]] known as [[Baphomet]], with Lucifer having appeared at their meetings in the form of a cat.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=126}} As well as these Christian groups, these claims were also made about Europe's Jewish community.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=28\u201329}} In the thirteenth century, there were also references made to a group of \"Luciferians\" led by a woman named Lucardis which hoped to see Satan rule in Heaven. References to this group continued into the fourteenth century, although historians studying the allegations concur that these Luciferians were likely a fictitious invention.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=29\u201331}}\n\nWithin Christian thought, the idea developed that certain individuals could make [[Deal with the Devil|a pact with Satan]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=57}} This may have emerged after observing that pacts with gods and goddesses played a role in various pre-Christian belief systems, or that such pacts were also made as part of the Christian cult of saints.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=58}} Another possibility is that it derives from a misunderstanding of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s condemnation of [[augury]] in his ''[[On the Christian Doctrine]]'', written in the late fourth century. Here, he stated that people who consulted augurs were entering \"''quasi pacts''\" (covenants) with demons.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=57\u201358}} The idea of the diabolical pact made with demons was popularized across Europe in the story of [[Faust]], likely based in part on the real life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving15.jpg|thumb|left|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]'s ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]\n\nAs the late medieval gave way to the [[early modern period]], European Christendom experienced a schism between the established [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the breakaway [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement.

\"anti-Satanism\" movement that any child's claim about Satanic ritual abuse must be true, because children would not lie.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=16}} Although some involved in the anti-Satanism movement were from Jewish and secular backgrounds,{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=369|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=15}} a central part was played by fundamentalist and evangelical forms of Christianity, in particular [[Pentecostalism]], with Christian groups holding conferences and producing books and videotapes to promote belief in the conspiracy.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Various figures in law enforcement also came to be promoters of the conspiracy theory, with such \"cult cops\" holding various conferences to promote it.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=191\u2013195}} The scare was later imported to the United Kingdom through visiting evangelicals and became popular among some of the country's social workers,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=220\u2013221}} resulting in a range of accusations and trials across

following increasing skepticism about such allegations,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=210\u2013211}} and a number of those who had been convicted of perpetrating Satanic ritual abuse saw their convictions overturned.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}}\nIn 1990, an agent of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Ken Lanning]], revealed that he had investigated 300 allegations of Satanic ritual abuse and found no evidence for Satanism or ritualistic activity in any of them.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}} In the UK, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] commissioned the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine to examine the allegations of SRA.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=249}} She noted that while approximately half did reveal evidence of genuine sexual abuse of children, none revealed any evidence that Satanist groups had been involved or that any murders had taken place.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|pp=13\u201314}} She noted three examples in which lone individuals engaged in child molestation had created a ritual performance to facilitate their sexual acts, with the intent of frightening their victims and justifying their actions, but that none of these child molestors were involved in wider Satanist groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=118|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=14}} By the 21st century, hysteria about Satanism has waned in most Western countries, although

===\n[[Image:GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg|right|thumb|Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', as illustrated by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nFrom the late seventeenth through to the nineteenth century, the character of Satan was increasingly rendered unimportant in Western philosophy and ignored in Christian theology, while in folklore he came to be seen as a foolish rather than a menacing figure.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} The development of new values in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]\u2014in particular those of [[reason]] and [[individualism]]\u2014contributed to a shift in how many Europeans viewed Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} In this context, a number of individuals took Satan out of the traditional Christian narrative and reread and reinterpreted him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe shifting view of Satan owes many of its origins to [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=28|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=70}} Milton was a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] and had never intended for his depiction of Satan to be a sympathetic one.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=28, 30}} However, in portraying Satan as a victim of his own pride who rebeled against God he humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} This was how Milton's Satan was understood by later readers like the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1pp=28, 30|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=69\u201370}} and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher [[William Godwin]], who reflected it in his 1793 book ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} ''Paradise Lost'' gained a wide readership in the eighteenth century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=70}} Milton thus became \"a central character in rewriting Satanism\" and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a \"''de facto'' Satanist\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of what has been termed \"literary Satanism\" or \"romantic Satanism\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} According to Van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a \"coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a ''post factum'' identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}} For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=69}} with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many [[romanticism|romanticist]] and [[Decadent movement|decadent]] figures.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}} For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a \"strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}}\n\nAmong the romanticist poets to adopt this view of Satan was the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who had been influenced by Milton.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=71\u201372}} In his poem ''[[Laon and Cythna]]'', Shelley praised the \"Serpent\", a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=97\u201398}}\nAnother was Shelley's fellow British poet [[Lord Byron]], who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work ''[[Eloa]]'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=74\u201375}} Satan was also adopted by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'', in which he outlined his own [[cosmogony]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=105\u2013107}}\nAlthough the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus it is problematic to regard them as religious Satanists.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}}\n\nRadical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u201383 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789\u201399, and the figure of Satan, who was interpreted as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by God, was an appealing one for many of the radical leftists of the period.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=77\u201379}} For them, Satan was \"a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}} The French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=117\u2013119}} Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian [[Mikhail Bakunin]], similarly described the figure of Satan as \"the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds\" in his book ''[[God and the State]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=119\u2013120}} These ideas likely inspired the American [[feminism|feminist]] activist [[Moses Harman]] to name his anarchist periodical ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} The idea of this \"Leftist Satan\" declined during the twentieth century,{{sfn|Van

Diamond, various black metal Satanists sought to distance themselves from LaVeyan Satanism, for instance by referring to their beliefs as \"devil worship\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} These individuals regarded Satan as a literal entity,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=479}} and in contrast to LaVey's views, they associated Satanism with criminality, suicide, and terror.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} For them, Christianity was regarded as a plague which required eradication.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=482}} Many of these individuals\u2014such as [[Varg Vikernes]] and [[Euronymous]]\u2014were Norwegian,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=479\u2013481}} and influenced by the strong anti-Christian views of this milieu, between 1992 and 1996 around fifty Norwegian churches were destroyed in arson attacks.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=481}} Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from [[Heathenry (new religious

set of features that were common to the groups in this Satanic milieu: these were the positive use of the term \"Satanist\" as a designation, an emphasis on individualism, a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, a transgressive and antinomian stance, a self-perception as an elite, and an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=7&ndash;9}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argued that the groups within the Satanic milieu could be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They saw reactive Satanism as encompassing \"popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic

LaVey espoused the view that \"god\" is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of \"god\".

They described this as an adolescent and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] means of rebeling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They believed that there were two tendencies within reactive Satanism: one, \"Satanic tourism\", was characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved, while the other, the \"Satanic quest\", was typified by a longer and deeper involvement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}}\n\nThe researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had [[psychic]] powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]]kian.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\nSome reactive Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=130}} During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} Introvigne expressed the view that these incidents were \"more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} In a few cases the crimes of these reactive Satanists have included murder. In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers\u2014one led by Stanley Baker in [[Big Sur]] and the other by Steven Hurd in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}} In 1984, a U.S. group called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group's illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers' death was a sacrifice to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}}\nThe American serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] for instance claimed that he was a Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out \"Hail Satan!\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=122}}\n\n===Demographics===\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was \"heavily dominated by young males\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=158}} Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=146}} Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=142}} Others have stated that they had experiences with [[supernatural]] phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}} A number reported feelings of anger at the hypocrisy of many practicing Christians and expressed the view that the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Gods of Christianity and other religions are unethical, citing issues such as the [[problem of evil]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=202\u2013204}} For some practitioners, Satanism gave a sense of hope, including for those who had been physically and sexually abused.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=179\u2013180}} Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were [[reincarnation]] and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=181\u2013182}} The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=183}} although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=209}} A number described performing [[curse|cursing]], in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=210\u2013212}}\nMost practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=151, 153}} Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=153}}\nFrom their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=157}} A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=159}} A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=160}} When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=171}} A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right; conversely, over two-thirds expressed negative or extremely negative views about [[Nazism]] and [[neo-Nazism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}}\n\n===Legal recognition===\n\nIn 2004 it was claimed that Satanism was allowed in the [[British Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] of the [[British Armed Forces]], despite opposition from Christians.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] [[CNN]]</ref><ref>Carter, Helen.
