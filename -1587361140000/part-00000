A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] is triggered via the afferent [[vagus nerve]]. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|date=May 2002|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175\u201385|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004|pmid=12803689}}</ref>\n\nAssociated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome. These consist of light-headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:\n\n*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.\n*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\"spots before the eyes\"), sweating, lightheadedness.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.\n\nSyncope has been linked with psychological triggers.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood|title=Why do Some People Faint at the Sight of Blood?|url-status=live|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood|archive-date=2017-09-06|access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref>  \"Blood-injury phobia\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope.

It is as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope.\n\nThis may be due to medications, [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=\"EB2014\" /> The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake.<ref name=NIH2020 /> For example, medical students would be at risk for orthostatic hypotensive syncope while observing long surgeries in the operating room.<ref name=\"Jamjoom2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE|year=2009|title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study|journal=BMC Med Educ|volume=9|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14|pmc=2657145|pmid=19284564}}</ref> There is also evidence that exercise training can help reduce orthostatic intolerance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Springer ''Reference''|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2011|chapter=Athletes and Sudden Cardiac Death|doi=10.1007/springerreference_188007}}</ref> More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]].<ref name=NIH2020 /> In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. This occurs when a people with normal physiology is unable to compensate for >20% loss in intravascular volume.<ref name=\":11\" /> This may be due to blood loss, dehydration or [[Fluid compartments|third-spacing]]. On standing the person will experience reflex tachycardia (at least 20% increased over supine) and a drop in blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension occurs when the person is unable to sustain a normal sympathetic response to blood pressure changes during movement despite adequate intravascular volume. There is little to no compensatory increase in heart rate or blood pressure when standing for up to 10 minutes. This is often due to an underlying disorder or medication use and is accompanied by other [[Adrenal insufficiency|hypoadrenergic signs]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Central nervous system ischemia===\nThe central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.<ref name=NIH2020 /> Common examples include [[stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s. While these conditions often impair consciousness they rarely meet the medical definition of syncope. [[Vertebrobasilar artery stroke|Vertebrobasilar]] transient ischemic attacks may produce true syncope as a symptom.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe respiratory system may compensate for dropping oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden [[Ischemia|ischemic]] episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.<ref name=\":1\" />  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs.<ref name=NIH2020 /> If the ischemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.<ref name=NIH2020 />  The weakness of the legs causes most people to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.\n\n====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====\nArterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Other causes===\nThere are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope.\n\nSeizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures.<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Atonic seizure|Akinetic seizures]] can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope. Often this is in combination with sudden, severe headache. It may occur as a result of a ruptured aneurysm or head trauma.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubosh Nicole M.|last2=Bellolio M.

After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes.

recovery.<ref name=EB2014/> It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the [[brain]], typically from [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].<ref name=EB2014/> There are sometimes [[prodrome|symptoms before the loss of consciousness]] such as [[lightheadedness]], [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[pale skin]], blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm.<ref name=NIH2020 /><ref name=EB2014/> Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching.<ref name=EB2014/><ref name=NIH2020 /> When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called [[presyncope]].<ref name=EB2014/> It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope.<ref name=EB2014/>\n\n<!-- Cause -->\nCauses range from non-serious to potentially fatal.<ref name=EB2014/> There are three broad categories of causes: [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]] related; [[reflex syncope|reflex]], also known as [[Nervous system|neurally]] mediated; and [[orthostatic hypotension]].<ref name=EB2014/><ref name=NIH2020 /> Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common.<ref

embolism]] or [[aortic dissection]] among others.<ref name=EB2014/> Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and [[bradycardia|heart rate decreases]] inappropriately.<ref name=EB2014/> This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as [[urination]], [[vomiting]], or [[coughing]].<ref name=EB2014/> Neurally mediated syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the [[carotid sinus]] is pressed.<ref name=EB2014/> The third type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure when changing position such as when standing up.<ref name=EB2014/> This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=EB2014/> There also seems to be a genetic component to syncope.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hadji-Turdeghal |first1=Katra |title=Genome-wide association study identifies locus at

(situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress.<ref name=NIH2020>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Syncope-Information-Page|title=Syncope Information Page {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> There are many different syncope syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope related by the same central mechanism.<ref name=NIH2020 /> First, the person is usually predisposed to decreased blood pressure by various environmental factors. A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] is triggered via the afferent [[vagus nerve]]. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|date=May 2002|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175\u201385|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004|pmid=12803689}}</ref>\n\nAssociated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome. These consist of light-headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:\n\n*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.\n*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\"spots before the eyes\"), sweating, lightheadedness.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.\n\nSyncope has been linked with psychological triggers.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood|title=Why do Some People Faint at the Sight of Blood?|url-status=live|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood|archive-date=2017-09-06|access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref>  \"Blood-injury phobia\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope. Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rarely, cardiac tumors such as atrial myxomas can also lead to syncope.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Structural cardiopulmonary disease====\nDiseases involving the shape and strength of the heart can be a cause of reduced blood flow to the brain, which increases risk for syncope.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints. Women are significantly more likely to experience syncope as a presenting symptom of a myocardial infarction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coventry|first=Linda L.|last2=Finn|first2=Judith|last3=Bremner|first3=Alexandra P.|date=2011-11-01|title=Sex differences in symptom presentation in acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://www.heartandlung.org/article/S0147-9563(11)00270-6/abstract|journal=Heart & Lung|language=English|volume=40|issue=6|pages=477\u201391|doi=10.1016/j.hrtlng.2011.05.001|issn=0147-9563|pmid=22000678}}</ref> In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAmong other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and [[pulmonary hypertension]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Other cardiac causes====\n[[Sick sinus syndrome]], a sinus node dysfunction, causing alternating bradycardia and tachycardia.  Often there is a long pause (asystole) between heartbeats.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Adams-Stokes syndrome]] is a cardiac syncope that occurs with seizures caused by complete or incomplete heart block. Symptoms include deep and fast respiration, weak and slow pulse and respiratory pauses that may last for 60 seconds.\n\n[[Subclavian steal syndrome]] arises from retrograde (reversed) flow of blood in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery.<ref name=\":1\" /> Symptoms such as syncope, lightheadedness, and paresthesias occur while exercising the arm on the affected side (most commonly the left).\n\n[[Aortic dissection]] (a tear in the aorta) and [[cardiomyopathy]] can also result in syncope.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Nallamothu BK, Mehta RH, Saint S, etal |title=Syncope in acute aortic dissection: diagnostic, prognostic, and clinical implications |journal=Am.

This is sensed by [[Carotid sinus|stretch receptors]] in the walls of vessels in the carotid sinus and aortic arch.<ref name=\":1\" /> These receptors then trigger a sympathetic nervous response to compensate and redistribute blood back into the brain. The sympathetic response causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. These together act to raise blood pressure back to baseline.<ref name=\":1\" /> Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms (\"lightheadedness\", \"greying-out\") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop.<ref name=NIH2020 /> However, the resulting \"transient orthostatic hypotension\" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease. It is as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope.\n\nThis may be due to medications, [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=\"EB2014\" /> The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake.<ref name=NIH2020 /> For example, medical students would be at risk for orthostatic hypotensive syncope while observing long surgeries in the operating room.<ref name=\"Jamjoom2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE|year=2009|title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study|journal=BMC Med Educ|volume=9|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14|pmc=2657145|pmid=19284564}}</ref> There is also evidence that exercise training can help reduce orthostatic intolerance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Springer ''Reference''|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2011|chapter=Athletes and Sudden Cardiac Death|doi=10.1007/springerreference_188007}}</ref> More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]].<ref name=NIH2020 /> In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. This occurs when a people with normal physiology is unable to compensate for >20% loss in intravascular volume.<ref name=\":11\" /> This may be due to blood loss, dehydration or [[Fluid compartments|third-spacing]]. On standing the person will experience reflex tachycardia (at least 20% increased over supine) and a drop in blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension occurs when the person is unable to sustain a normal sympathetic response to blood pressure changes during movement despite adequate intravascular volume. There is little to no compensatory increase in heart rate or blood pressure when standing for up to 10 minutes. This is often due to an underlying disorder or medication use and is accompanied by other [[Adrenal insufficiency|hypoadrenergic signs]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Central nervous system ischemia===\nThe central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.<ref name=NIH2020 /> Common examples include [[stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s. While these conditions often impair consciousness they rarely meet the medical definition of syncope. [[Vertebrobasilar artery stroke|Vertebrobasilar]] transient ischemic attacks may produce true syncope as a symptom.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe respiratory system may compensate for dropping oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden [[Ischemia|ischemic]] episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.<ref name=\":1\" />  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs.<ref name=NIH2020 /> If the ischemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.<ref name=NIH2020 />  The weakness of the legs causes most people to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.\n\n====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====\nArterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Other causes===\nThere are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope.\n\nSeizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures.<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Atonic seizure|Akinetic seizures]] can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope. Often this is in combination with sudden, severe headache. It may occur as a result of a ruptured aneurysm or head trauma.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubosh Nicole M.|last2=Bellolio M.

For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting.<ref name=\":12\" /> At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes. Avoiding triggers and situations where loss of consciousness would be seriously hazardous (operating heavy machinery, commercial pilot, etc.) has been shown to be effective.\n\nIf fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the case where syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Risk tools ===\nThe [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope.

Additionally, on the same date ''For the Emperor'' was released as an audiobook, narrated by Stephen Perring and Penelope Rawlins.\n\n==Character==\n{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=July 2011}}\nCiaphas Cain is a \"[[Commissar]],\" a [[political commissar|political officer]] of the Imperium of Man's troops. Commissars are charged with maintaining the morale and loyalty of Imperial troops, an important matter when one considers the horrific odds and staggering casualties of the \"grim dark future\" of the ''WH40K'' setting. Despite holding no standard rank and being outside the [[chain of command]], commisars have wide discretionary powers, including summary execution or even [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]], in pursuit of their duties.  Cain, having observed the tendency of many members of the Commissariat to fall victim to [[Fragging|\"accidental\" friendly fire]], prefers to lead by example and encouragement instead of fear, and has gained a reputation for charismatic leadership, self-effacing heroism and concern for the common trooper.  This has spiraled rather out of Cain's control, as he is now regarded as a \"Hero of the Imperium\", and is frequently assigned to dangerous and unusual circumstances.  The truth, as presented in the novels, is that Cain is the sort of person he himself is supposed to execute: self-serving, incredibly paranoid, a truly skilled liar, and happy to put as many bodies between him and the enemy as possible in order to save his own skin.  The author has stated that the character of Cain was inspired by both [[Harry Flashman]] and [[Edmund Blackadder]].<ref name=\"Hero of the Imperium\"/>\n\nCain is an [[unreliable narrator]].  His memoirs are completely self-centered, containing nothing on the context of his adventures, forcing Vail to intersperse his narrative with secondary sources.  Vail must also add occasional footnotes to some of his recollections to point out that Cain has just glossed over something another man might take pride in.  For instance, Vail at one point praises Cain's marksmanship, pointing out that he had just made quite a remarkable long-range shot with an inaccurate pistol, while Cain himself writes onward without acknowledging (or possibly even being aware of) his own skill.  Likewise, Cain views himself as a cowardly figure of little worth, often wondering why various enemy generals are so fixated on defeating him&mdash;leaving us completely ignorant (until Vail points it out) of the morale boost caused by the mere ''presence'' of a genuine \"Hero of the Imperium\", much less any acts of heroism that may be forthcoming.  In the end, Vail's limited interjections indicate that she believes Cain is too hard on himself; in the foreword to \"Fight or Flight\", author Sandy Mitchell admitted that he himself is not sure if Cain is truly a coward, or a genuine hero with a massive [[inferiority complex]] or a case of [[impostor syndrome]].\n\nEven though Cain has always sought to find some safe, quiet post (it could be argued that is in fact all he has ever wanted), he is one of the most combat-experienced commissars in the Imperium.  Some of his many notable exploits include being a liaison to [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marine]] chapter which involved various first hand contact to [[Genestealer]]s that killed various Terminators of [[List of Space Marine Chapters#Reclaimers|The Reclaimers]] who were clearing a space hulk of [[Tyranids]]; visiting and surviving two different [[Necrons|Necron]] tombs; fighting and bringing together the scattered PDF from a world and then driving off the Orks, and escaping on a [[Dark Eldar]] slave ship. He frequently refers to such experiences as invaluable as they taught him to fight (or more frequently, run away from) the enemies of the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium]]. Inquisitor Vail believes (albeit with a certain amount of irony) that it is precisely this quality that has made him such an effective leader and agent of the Imperium.  He is aided in these exploits by his martial skill, which is quite significant, as demonstrated by his ability to temporarily stalemate a Chaos Space Marine in melee with his chainsword. Vail's footnotes in the second novel indicated Cain was probably one of the finest swordsmen in his region of the galaxy.\n\nCain maintains his reputation of heroism primarily for its benefit to him; most soldiers around him obey his orders without question, and he is constantly invited to parties and upscale social functions.  It is, strangely, aided by his habits of self-preservation; in seeking out the last place the enemy is likely to be, he frequently wanders into the exact place they're pulling off the most secret or critical part of their schemes.  Of course, this habit has become so ingrained in his and the public's conscious that everyone expects him to volunteer for whatever particularly dangerous duty has just come along.  He is also humanitarian in his dealings with Imperial Guardsmen. Cain does not do this out of altruism, but rather because soldiers who like him are more likely to willingly fight for or protect him and/or less likely to shoot him from behind. Cain notes that he has tried to teach commissar cadets this alternative style of morale-boosting, with only marginal success.  Cain's cowardice and desire for self-preservation actually make him an unusually effective strategic commander compared to his contemporaries:  keeping your own men alive while killing as many of the enemy as possible using disproportionate sneak attacks is an efficient use of limited resources - in contrast with most other commissars, who are content to send their men on glorious but strategically pointless suicide charges. \n\nCain's past is shrouded in mystery. Vail's footnotes indicate that, despite her research into the subject, she could find no official documentation on where he was born or what his childhood was like. However, from his writings, it can be inferred that he was raised on a hive world and his parents both served in the Imperial Guard.  The situation is exacerbated by his habitual lying; so accomplished a dissembler is he that even nearby [[telepathy|telepaths]] felt no urge to distrust him when he lied in their presence.  He has become so good at lying that he is sometimes unsure of where the lies stop and the actual Ciaphas Cain begins, and it is possible that no one ever truly knew him.  The closest to doing so would probably be Amberley Vail, not only due to her stewardship of his memoirs but through over a century of both professional and romantic entanglement.\n\nAccording to Vail's footnotes, Cain retired from service (something very few people live long enough to do in ''WH40K'') and took up service at a military academy on Perlia, where he trained potential Commissars, participated in the Thirteenth Black Crusade, and published an official biography: ''To Serve the Emperor: A Commissar's Life''.  Passing away of natural causes, he was buried with full military honours&mdash;though, due to the many false allegations of his death, there is a standing order that Cain remain listed on active duty at all times, which has not been revoked even though he is documentably dead and interred.<ref>''Death or Glory'', page 294</ref>  The much longer and more self-critical \"Cain Archive,\" from whence Inquisitor Vail publishes her accounts, were unorganized at the time of his death; for instance, Vail makes reference to having had to assemble at least one volume (''Cain's Last Stand'') by stitching together several vignettes scattered throughout the document.  Vail's introductions to each excerpt indicate that she is circulating them amongst fellow members of the Inquisition, with a strong caution not to make them available for public consumption so as to leave Cain's legacy untarnished.\n\nThe series has many similarities with the [[The Flashman Papers|Flashman series of books]] by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], in both style and content. Though of course with a marked change in setting and the fact that Cain is considerably less despicable.\n\n==Notable Associates==\n{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=July 2011}}\n* '''Gunner Ferik Jurgen''' \u2013 Cain's personal aide. Noticeable for his powerful [[body odour]] and chronic [[psoriasis]] (which discourages others from getting too close to him), Jurgen is also a \"blank\", or a psychic null (which might account for other people's dislike of Jurgen as much as his hygiene problems, as can be surmised from how badly the more susceptible psykers respond to Jurgen even in friendly situations); this trait saved them both on more than one occasion. Jurgen has complete loyalty to Commissar Cain, and his unwavering dedication to him has helped both of them through many dangerous situations. Cain finds Jurgen an excellent aide, as Jurgen doggedly follows Cain's orders, always thinking of them as for the good of the Imperium, something which Cain finds extremely useful. Jurgen is also noted for his fear of flying and his exceptionally aggressive driving style; he routinely drives Cain's personal scout Salamander in a manner described as \"insane\" and, coupled with his literal-mindedness and loyalty, he will often crash through walls or drive straight up shuttle boarding ramps without hesitation. Jurgen also makes an excellent secretary, as very few people are able to get past him to see Cain unless it is ''very'' important (reducing the amount of office work done by Cain and allowing him to take \"breaks\" without his absence being noticed).  Despite his otherwise dogged adherence to authority, Jurgen's appearance has often been remarked as being extremely shabby for a soldier.  He has never been able to find a uniform that fit him properly, maintains a shabby beard (which he has medical dispensation for due to his skin diseases) and believes hygiene is something that happens to other people. Since Cain is largely based on the series of books called the Flashman Papers by George MacDonald Fraser and Blackadder, then it is reasonable to assume that Jurgen is based on Fraser's other creation McAuslan and Blackadder's erstwhile sidekick [[Baldrick]], who are also earnest soldiers with poor hygiene.\n* '''Inquisitor Amberley Vail''' \u2013 an inquisitor of the [[Ordo Xenos]] who worked with Cain on many occasions. She is described as an attractive blonde & blue eyed woman with an easy personality, in stark contrast to the stereotypical expectation of Inquisitors (which Vail noted was exactly the point). In the novels, it is strongly suggested that their relationship is a romantic one,<ref>''Duty Calls'', page 174</ref> and Cain appears to care for her a great deal. However, like all inquisitors, Amberley takes her job very seriously and would not hesitate to kill Cain if he posed a threat to the Imperium. Inquisitor Vail appears as an active character in ''For The Emperor'', ''Duty Calls'' and ''Choose Your Enemies'', makes brief cameos in ''Caves of Ice'', ''Cain's Last Stand'' and ''The Last Ditch'', and also contributes to the other books in the series, acting as editor of Cain's memoirs.  Despite temptation, Vail generally resists opportunities to annotate or justify her own portrayal in Cain's notes.\n* '''Colonel Regina Kasteen''' and '''Major Ruput Broklaw''' - The regimental commander and second-in-command of the 597th Valhallan.  They are introduced in the first novel of the series as former company commanders in the 296th and 301st Valhallan, respectively, both of which fought in the defense of Corania against the tyranids and sustained such heavy casualties that bureaucrats in the Munitorium decided to simply merge the two units into one.  Cain is assigned the unenviable job of unifying the newly christened 296/301st, one half of which was once an all-male front-line Guard unit and the other an all-female reservist outfit.  Amongst other actions, Cain integrates the regiment at squad level, putting men and women side-by-side, and renames it the 597th (the sum of 296 and 301).  Despite earlier animosity, Kasteen and Broklaw develop a respectful and functional working relationship, not only with each other, but with Cain as well, who becomes deeply integrated into the command structure (serving almost as a third [[Commanding officer|CO]]) and remains with the 597th for a good third of his career.\n* '''Jenit Sulla''' \u2013 Sulla is a [[Lieutenant]] with the 597th [[History of the Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000)#Valhallan Ice Warriors|Valhallan]] Regiment during the novels, and rose to become a general. Numerous extracts from her post-retirement memoirs are interspersed by Inquisitor Vail in the novels as background material, usually with a derogatory remark about Sulla's [[purple prose]] and complete lack of literary talent. Sulla sees Cain as a mentor, and remains oblivious to Cain's dislike for her due her aggressive and gung-ho attitude, which unnecessarily puts people (such as Cain) in danger.  However, even Cain cannot deny her efficiency and competence, and Vail's footnotes point out that Sulla's soldiers had complete confidence in her.\n* '''Toren Divas''' - A Lieutenant and later the Major of the 12th Valhallan Artillery Regiment, Cain's unit prior to being reassigned to regimental HQ and the 597th. Divas is probably the closest thing Cain has to a best friend. He is an enthusiastic Imperial Guardsman and is always eager to fight the enemies of the Imperium head on, traits that Cain finds annoying and dangerous. Cain remarks several times in his memoirs that this enthusiasm is quite probably because Divas' posting in an artillery company means he fights those enemies from miles away where they can't shoot back, which was in fact Cain's reason for seeking out the post.\n* '''Lord General Zyvan''' - 'I'm the Lord-bloody-General of the Rimward Sectors,...'<ref>''The Greater Good'', p.96</ref> His high opinion of Cain is reflected in that he often invites Cain to dine with him and arranges a supply of Cains' preferred hot beverage, the acquired-taste Tanna leaf tea, when Cain is present.

Nevertheless, Cain seems to enjoy Mott's company, and Mott at times helps Cain cheat in gambling houses using an intuitive grasp of probability.\n\n===597th Valhallan Soldiers===\n* '''Sergeant Lustig and his squad''' Described by Cain as a capable squad leader, he and his squad make their first appearance in ''For The Emperor'' as honour guard for Kasteen and Cain, later helping them in bringing a group of Tau diplomats safely back to their HQ. They appear again in ''Caves of Ice'' being led by Cain in search for missing miners. Lustig is made an officer in ''The Traitor's Hand.''\n* '''Trooper Penlan''' is the only named member of Lustig's squad. She appears in all the books dealing with the Valhallan 597th and seems to be a magnet for accidents, gaining her the nickname \"Jinxie\". It is noted in ''Caves of Ice'' that other soldiers believe having her nearby would redirect their own bad luck to her. In ''The Traitor's Hand'', some of her accidents are listed, with the observation that they often indirectly benefited the mission or the soldiers around her.\n* '''Sergeant Grifen and her squad''' first appear in ''Caves of Ice''. She and her squad accompany Cain on an expedition into the tunnels beneath the mining facility, where they encounter a series of hostile animals, Ork \"Kommandos\" and a force of Necrons. She and Mary Magot also appear in ''The Traitor's Hand'' assisting Cain again, this time against Chaos cultists. In ''The Traitor's Hand'' Cain suggests that Magot is perhaps not interested in men, and he also suggests in ''Caves of Ice'' that Magot and Grifen have a relationship deeper than squadmates.\n\n===The Reclaimers Chapter===\n* '''Sholer''' - An apothecary in The Reclaimers Chapter.

Additionally, on the same date ''For the Emperor'' was released as an audiobook, narrated by Stephen Perring and Penelope Rawlins.\n\n==Character==\n{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=July 2011}}\nCiaphas Cain is a \"[[Commissar]],\" a [[political commissar|political officer]] of the Imperium of Man's troops. Commissars are charged with maintaining the morale and loyalty of Imperial troops, an important matter when one considers the horrific odds and staggering casualties of the \"grim dark future\" of the ''WH40K'' setting. Despite holding no standard rank and being outside the [[chain of command]], commisars have wide discretionary powers, including summary execution or even [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]], in pursuit of their duties.  Cain, having observed the tendency of many members of the Commissariat to fall victim to [[Fragging|\"accidental\" friendly fire]], prefers to lead by example and encouragement instead of fear, and has gained a reputation for charismatic leadership, self-effacing heroism and concern for the common trooper.  This has spiraled rather out of Cain's control, as he is now regarded as a \"Hero of the Imperium\", and is frequently assigned to dangerous and unusual circumstances.  The truth, as presented in the novels, is that Cain is the sort of person he himself is supposed to execute: self-serving, incredibly paranoid, a truly skilled liar, and happy to put as many bodies between him and the enemy as possible in order to save his own skin.  The author has stated that the character of Cain was inspired by both [[Harry Flashman]] and [[Edmund Blackadder]].<ref name=\"Hero of the Imperium\"/>\n\nCain is an [[unreliable narrator]].  His memoirs are completely self-centered, containing nothing on the context of his adventures, forcing Vail to intersperse his narrative with secondary sources.  Vail must also add occasional footnotes to some of his recollections to point out that Cain has just glossed over something another man might take pride in.  For instance, Vail at one point praises Cain's marksmanship, pointing out that he had just made quite a remarkable long-range shot with an inaccurate pistol, while Cain himself writes onward without acknowledging (or possibly even being aware of) his own skill.  Likewise, Cain views himself as a cowardly figure of little worth, often wondering why various enemy generals are so fixated on defeating him&mdash;leaving us completely ignorant (until Vail points it out) of the morale boost caused by the mere ''presence'' of a genuine \"Hero of the Imperium\", much less any acts of heroism that may be forthcoming.  In the end, Vail's limited interjections indicate that she believes Cain is too hard on himself; in the foreword to \"Fight or Flight\", author Sandy Mitchell admitted that he himself is not sure if Cain is truly a coward, or a genuine hero with a massive [[inferiority complex]] or a case of [[impostor syndrome]].\n\nEven though Cain has always sought to find some safe, quiet post (it could be argued that is in fact all he has ever wanted), he is one of the most combat-experienced commissars in the Imperium.  Some of his many notable exploits include being a liaison to [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marine]] chapter which involved various first hand contact to [[Genestealer]]s that killed various Terminators of [[List of Space Marine Chapters#Reclaimers|The Reclaimers]] who were clearing a space hulk of [[Tyranids]]; visiting and surviving two different [[Necrons|Necron]] tombs; fighting and bringing together the scattered PDF from a world and then driving off the Orks, and escaping on a [[Dark Eldar]] slave ship. He frequently refers to such experiences as invaluable as they taught him to fight (or more frequently, run away from) the enemies of the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium]]. Inquisitor Vail believes (albeit with a certain amount of irony) that it is precisely this quality that has made him such an effective leader and agent of the Imperium.  He is aided in these exploits by his martial skill, which is quite significant, as demonstrated by his ability to temporarily stalemate a Chaos Space Marine in melee with his chainsword. Vail's footnotes in the second novel indicated Cain was probably one of the finest swordsmen in his region of the galaxy.\n\nCain maintains his reputation of heroism primarily for its benefit to him; most soldiers around him obey his orders without question, and he is constantly invited to parties and upscale social functions.  It is, strangely, aided by his habits of self-preservation; in seeking out the last place the enemy is likely to be, he frequently wanders into the exact place they're pulling off the most secret or critical part of their schemes.  Of course, this habit has become so ingrained in his and the public's conscious that everyone expects him to volunteer for whatever particularly dangerous duty has just come along.  He is also humanitarian in his dealings with Imperial Guardsmen. Cain does not do this out of altruism, but rather because soldiers who like him are more likely to willingly fight for or protect him and/or less likely to shoot him from behind. Cain notes that he has tried to teach commissar cadets this alternative style of morale-boosting, with only marginal success.  Cain's cowardice and desire for self-preservation actually make him an unusually effective strategic commander compared to his contemporaries:  keeping your own men alive while killing as many of the enemy as possible using disproportionate sneak attacks is an efficient use of limited resources - in contrast with most other commissars, who are content to send their men on glorious but strategically pointless suicide charges. \n\nCain's past is shrouded in mystery. Vail's footnotes indicate that, despite her research into the subject, she could find no official documentation on where he was born or what his childhood was like. However, from his writings, it can be inferred that he was raised on a hive world and his parents both served in the Imperial Guard.  The situation is exacerbated by his habitual lying; so accomplished a dissembler is he that even nearby [[telepathy|telepaths]] felt no urge to distrust him when he lied in their presence.  He has become so good at lying that he is sometimes unsure of where the lies stop and the actual Ciaphas Cain begins, and it is possible that no one ever truly knew him.  The closest to doing so would probably be Amberley Vail, not only due to her stewardship of his memoirs but through over a century of both professional and romantic entanglement.\n\nAccording to Vail's footnotes, Cain retired from service (something very few people live long enough to do in ''WH40K'') and took up service at a military academy on Perlia, where he trained potential Commissars, participated in the Thirteenth Black Crusade, and published an official biography: ''To Serve the Emperor: A Commissar's Life''.  Passing away of natural causes, he was buried with full military honours&mdash;though, due to the many false allegations of his death, there is a standing order that Cain remain listed on active duty at all times, which has not been revoked even though he is documentably dead and interred.<ref>''Death or Glory'', page 294</ref>  The much longer and more self-critical \"Cain Archive,\" from whence Inquisitor Vail publishes her accounts, were unorganized at the time of his death; for instance, Vail makes reference to having had to assemble at least one volume (''Cain's Last Stand'') by stitching together several vignettes scattered throughout the document.  Vail's introductions to each excerpt indicate that she is circulating them amongst fellow members of the Inquisition, with a strong caution not to make them available for public consumption so as to leave Cain's legacy untarnished.\n\nThe series has many similarities with the [[The Flashman Papers|Flashman series of books]] by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], in both style and content. Though of course with a marked change in setting and the fact that Cain is considerably less despicable.\n\n==Notable Associates==\n{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=July 2011}}\n* '''Gunner Ferik Jurgen''' \u2013 Cain's personal aide. Noticeable for his powerful [[body odour]] and chronic [[psoriasis]] (which discourages others from getting too close to him), Jurgen is also a \"blank\", or a psychic null (which might account for other people's dislike of Jurgen as much as his hygiene problems, as can be surmised from how badly the more susceptible psykers respond to Jurgen even in friendly situations); this trait saved them both on more than one occasion. Jurgen has complete loyalty to Commissar Cain, and his unwavering dedication to him has helped both of them through many dangerous situations. Cain finds Jurgen an excellent aide, as Jurgen doggedly follows Cain's orders, always thinking of them as for the good of the Imperium, something which Cain finds extremely useful. Jurgen is also noted for his fear of flying and his exceptionally aggressive driving style; he routinely drives Cain's personal scout Salamander in a manner described as \"insane\" and, coupled with his literal-mindedness and loyalty, he will often crash through walls or drive straight up shuttle boarding ramps without hesitation. Jurgen also makes an excellent secretary, as very few people are able to get past him to see Cain unless it is ''very'' important (reducing the amount of office work done by Cain and allowing him to take \"breaks\" without his absence being noticed).  Despite his otherwise dogged adherence to authority, Jurgen's appearance has often been remarked as being extremely shabby for a soldier.  He has never been able to find a uniform that fit him properly, maintains a shabby beard (which he has medical dispensation for due to his skin diseases) and believes hygiene is something that happens to other people. Since Cain is largely based on the series of books called the Flashman Papers by George MacDonald Fraser and Blackadder, then it is reasonable to assume that Jurgen is based on Fraser's other creation McAuslan and Blackadder's erstwhile sidekick [[Baldrick]], who are also earnest soldiers with poor hygiene.\n* '''Inquisitor Amberley Vail''' \u2013 an inquisitor of the [[Ordo Xenos]] who worked with Cain on many occasions. She is described as an attractive blonde & blue eyed woman with an easy personality, in stark contrast to the stereotypical expectation of Inquisitors (which Vail noted was exactly the point). In the novels, it is strongly suggested that their relationship is a romantic one,<ref>''Duty Calls'', page 174</ref> and Cain appears to care for her a great deal. However, like all inquisitors, Amberley takes her job very seriously and would not hesitate to kill Cain if he posed a threat to the Imperium. Inquisitor Vail appears as an active character in ''For The Emperor'', ''Duty Calls'' and ''Choose Your Enemies'', makes brief cameos in ''Caves of Ice'', ''Cain's Last Stand'' and ''The Last Ditch'', and also contributes to the other books in the series, acting as editor of Cain's memoirs.  Despite temptation, Vail generally resists opportunities to annotate or justify her own portrayal in Cain's notes.\n* '''Colonel Regina Kasteen''' and '''Major Ruput Broklaw''' - The regimental commander and second-in-command of the 597th Valhallan.

At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \"[[Variety (linguistics)|synchronic variation]]\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"<ref name=\"Deutscher\">The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71</ref>\n\n==Types==\nAll languages change continually,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Agrippa\n| first1                = Heinrich Cornelius\n| author-link1          = Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\n| year              = 1510\n| chapter               = 23: Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\n| title                 = De Occulta Philosophia\n|trans-title=Occult Philosophy\n| publication-date      = 1651\n| quote                 = [...] all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions [...].\n}}\n</ref>\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the '''external evolution'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 74\u201398\n|quote= [...] the shifting movements of languages in light of whatever knowledge is available of the history of humanity.\n}}\n</ref>\nand '''internal evolution''' of languages.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 98\u2013141\n|quote= Internal evolution [...] is the passing from one system to another.

Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].\n\n[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nIn the English language, there occurred a shift from common words (e.g. house) towards the use of rarer words (e.g. building), but on a marginal level. Within over 300 years, the relative frequency of words in samples of English and American newspapers decreased only about three units within a possible theoretical range of 208 units that is 1-2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Phonetic and phonological changes===\n{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}\n\nThe concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William \n| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/988800917eda494963e28b62f6821d0f51000b84\n| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 273\u2013309 \n| doi = 10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799 \n}}\n</ref>\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society \u2014 compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\n===Spelling changes===\n\nStandardisation of [[spelling]] originated centuries ago.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\n<!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.\n\nModern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as \"night\" hints at an older pronunciation, the \"gh\" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by \"ch\" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the \"k\"-sound once pronounced in words like \"knee\" or \"knight\", and the \"ch\" in \"chicken\" or \"cheese\", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].\n\nOne could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word \"eyren\" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, \"egges\" (modern English: \"eggs\").\n-->\n\n===Semantic changes===\n{{Main|Semantic change}}\n\nSemantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative\n* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive\n* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses\n* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Syntactic change===\n{{Main|Syntactic change}}\n\n[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes \u2013 attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] \u2013 may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary.

She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"<ref>Coates, 1992: 169</ref>\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nKadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in XV-XVI centuries the government played key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive norms]] with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be effciently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

They then speculate that technological innovation (transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, and perceived status change. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the \"higher-status\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calque]]\n* [[Grammaticalization]]\n* [[Koin\u00e9 language]]\n* [[Morphemization]]\n* [[Neologism]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Phono-semantic matching]]\n* [[Wave model (linguistics)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n;Journals\n*{{cite journal |last1=Altintas |first1=K. |last2=Can |first2=F. |last3=Patton |first3=J.

At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \"[[Variety (linguistics)|synchronic variation]]\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"<ref name=\"Deutscher\">The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71</ref>\n\n==Types==\nAll languages change continually,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Agrippa\n| first1                = Heinrich Cornelius\n| author-link1          = Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\n| year              = 1510\n| chapter               = 23: Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\n| title                 = De Occulta Philosophia\n|trans-title=Occult Philosophy\n| publication-date      = 1651\n| quote                 = [...] all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions [...].\n}}\n</ref>\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the '''external evolution'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 74\u201398\n|quote= [...] the shifting movements of languages in light of whatever knowledge is available of the history of humanity.\n}}\n</ref>\nand '''internal evolution''' of languages.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 98\u2013141\n|quote= Internal evolution [...] is the passing from one system to another.

Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].\n\n[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nIn the English language, there occurred a shift from common words (e.g. house) towards the use of rarer words (e.g. building), but on a marginal level. Within over 300 years, the relative frequency of words in samples of English and American newspapers decreased only about three units within a possible theoretical range of 208 units that is 1-2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Phonetic and phonological changes===\n{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}\n\nThe concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William \n| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/988800917eda494963e28b62f6821d0f51000b84\n| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 273\u2013309 \n| doi = 10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799 \n}}\n</ref>\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society \u2014 compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\n===Spelling changes===\n\nStandardisation of [[spelling]] originated centuries ago.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\n<!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.\n\nModern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as \"night\" hints at an older pronunciation, the \"gh\" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by \"ch\" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the \"k\"-sound once pronounced in words like \"knee\" or \"knight\", and the \"ch\" in \"chicken\" or \"cheese\", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].\n\nOne could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word \"eyren\" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, \"egges\" (modern English: \"eggs\").\n-->\n\n===Semantic changes===\n{{Main|Semantic change}}\n\nSemantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative\n* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive\n* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses\n* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Syntactic change===\n{{Main|Syntactic change}}\n\n[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes \u2013 attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] \u2013 may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Sociolinguistics==\n\nThe [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic [[heterogeneity]]. She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"<ref>Coates, 1992: 169</ref>\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nKadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in XV-XVI centuries the government played key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive norms]] with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be effciently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

They then speculate that technological innovation (transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or from stone to metal tools) or military prowess (as in the abduction of British women by Vikings to Iceland) causes immigration of at least some males, and perceived status change. Then, in mixed-language marriages with these males, prehistoric women would often have chosen to transmit the \"higher-status\" spouse's language to their children, yielding the language/Y-chromosome correlation seen today.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Calque]]\n* [[Grammaticalization]]\n* [[Koin\u00e9 language]]\n* [[Morphemization]]\n* [[Neologism]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Phono-semantic matching]]\n* [[Wave model (linguistics)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n;Journals\n*{{cite journal |last1=Altintas |first1=K. |last2=Can |first2=F. |last3=Patton |first3=J.

Under his tutelage, quarterback Kelly Hughes was named the AUS Most Valuable Player. After this season, Jeffrey was named full-time head coach.\n\n2009 saw the Mounties go 0-8, but Gary Ross was named AUS MVP, the first time since 1991 and 1992 (Grant Keaney) that Mounties were named MVPs in back-to-back years. 2010 was the resurgence of the Mounties, led by second-year quarterback Jake Hotchkiss, who that year became the second Mountie quarterback under Jeffrey to be named an AUS All-Star. The Mounties went 4-4 and hosted the AUS Semi-Final for the first time, which was also the first home playoff game since 1998. Jeffrey was named the AUS Coach Of the Year, the first Mountie to receive this honour since John MacNeil in 1996.\n\nThe Mounties finished second in the [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]] conference in 2010 and hosted their first home playoff game (conference semi-finals) since the new millennium.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atlanticuniversitysport.com/sports/fball/records/pastchamps |title=Atlantic University Sport Football Past Champions |publisher= [[Atlantic University Sport]] |accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref> Another 0-8 season in 2011 was followed up by a successful 2012 which had the Mounties in the playoffs again, and boasted the AUS leading rusher (Jordan Botel) and the emergence of a new leader at quarterback, freshman Brandon Leyh. The 3-5 Mounties also experienced an offence without either Gary Ross or Adam Molnar, as this was the first season without one of the two star receivers in the lineup.\n \nIn 2013, the Mounties won the [[Loney Bowl]] for the first time since 1997. They followed up that campaign with their first undefeated season in the [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]], posting an 8-0 record en route to their second consecutive [[Jewett Trophy]] championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/2014-15/releases/20141025pi51hd |title=Mounties Complete Undefeated Regular Season With 18-10 Win Over StFX |publisher=[[Mount Allison Mounties]] |date=October 25, 2014 |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref> In 2015, the Mounties finished in first place in the [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]] regular season with a 5-3 record and hosted the [[Loney Bowl]] for the second consecutive season. They were also looking to win their third consecutive [[Jewett Trophy]] but would end up falling short to the [[St. Francis Xavier X-Men football|St. Francis Xavier X-Men]] 24-18. \n\n2016 would be the first season with Scott Brady as the team's new [[head coach]], who had been with the team as as assistant coach since 2010. Brady was the first permanent head coach in the program's recent history who was both a Mount Allison graduate and former player for the Mounties. The team ended up making the playoffs as the second place team. They would defeat the [[Acadia Axemen football|Acadia Axemen]] 27-18 to compete in their fourth straight Loney Bowl but would end up losing to the St. Francis Xavier X-Men 29-8. In 2017, the team would see their five-year playoff streak come to an end as they missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011. \n\nFollowing a coaching change, with Peter Fraser as the team's new head coach, the team would regress further with a 2-6 record. In 2019, the team lost their first four games of the season, but then won their next three and eventually finished with a 3-5 record and enough to qualify for the playoffs.\n\n==Recent regular season results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

A league All-Star and All-Canadian in 1996 and 1997, Girard was also a nominee for the President's Trophy as the country's Most Outstanding Defensive Player in 1997, winning the Atlantic Conference's honour in that category. The following spring, in the 1998 Canadian Football League's (CFL) Canadian College Draft, he became the highest-drafted Mountie ever, going in the first round 5th overall to the Edmonton Eskimos. He played there for several seasons before joining former Mountie teammate \u00c9ric Lapointe as a member of Montreal Alouettes, retiring as a member of the Alouettes.\n*[[\u00c9ric Lapointe (Canadian football)|Eric Lapointe]] (\u201900) represents more than just records and statistics, although he dominated both areas of the sport during his four years as a Mountie.  He was looked to by his teammates for on-field and locker-room inspiration, and he did not disappoint. Drafted by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], Lapointe ended up with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] in 1999 where he rushed for 691 yards during the season, helping his team to the [[Grey Cup]] in which he was the game's leading ground gainer.  Traded to [[Toronto Argonauts|Toronto]], he ultimately ended his career with his hometown [[Montreal Alouettes]]. In his final season he was the starting running back in the Grey Cup game. Eric retired with the Alouettes in 2006 after their [[96th Grey Cup|Grey Cup loss]] to the [[BC Lions]].<ref name=\"Lapointe\"/> In 2012 he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame for his career as a Mountie.<ref name=CFHOF/>\n*Gary Ross (\u201911) The football team\u2019s most valuable player in recent years, Ross had an unprecedented football season in 2009, breaking several school and conference records along the way. Leading the league in most of the special teams and receiving categories, the five-foot-nine Ross was selected as the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) conference\u2019s MVP and was a strong nominee for the nation\u2019s most outstanding player award \u2014 the [[Hec Crighton Trophy]]. While he narrowly missed this honour he was still recognized with two All-Canadian awards for the second consecutive season. A four-time AUS Player of the Week, he was named both as a first-team Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) All-Canadian inside receiver, and a second-team CIS All-Canadian return specialist. He led the Atlantic conference in receptions (60), receiving yards (818 yards), receiving touchdowns (four), and all-purpose yards (1,423 yards). He has been an all-star receiver and the conference\u2019s top special teams player in each of his four years at Mount Allison, and is now the AUS career leader in receptions (172), receiving yards (2,582), and all-purpose yards (5,990 yards). This season he was the only Atlantic conference player to average over 100 yards receiving per game (102.2 yards per game) and his 60 receptions are also a new AUS single-season record, smashing the previous mark of 48. His 818 receiving yards are a new Mounties\u2019 single-season school record and the fourth highest total in league history. He currently ranks second in AUS history with 1,679 career punt return yards and 1,403 career kickoff return yards.\n*[[John Reardon]] ('97) Canadian all-star player for Mount Allison who became an [[actor]] for television and film.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/coaches/index Mounties official site]\n\n{{U Sports football}}\n\n[[Category:U Sports teams]]\n[[Category:U Sports football teams]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in New Brunswick]]\n[[Category:Mount Allison University]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|U Sports football team}}\n{{Infobox CIS football school\n| TeamName         = Mount Allison Mounties\n| FirstYear        = 1955\n| Logo             = Mount Allison Mounties Football Logo.jpg\n| Helmet           = \n| AthlDirectorDisp = Pierre Arsenault\n| HeadCoachDisplay = Peter Fraser\n| HeadCoachLink    = Peter Fraser (Canadian football coach)\n| HeadCoachYear    = 2nd\n| HCWins           = 5\n| HCLosses         = 11\n| HCTies           = 0\n| OtherStaff       = [[Kyle Graves]] ([[Offensive coordinator|OC]])<br>Zak Colangelo ([[Defensive coordinator|DC]])\n| Stadium          = [[MacAulay Field|Alumni Field]]\n| FieldName        = \n| StadiumBuilt     = \n| StadCapacity     = 2500\n| StadSurface      = Field Turf\n| Location         = [[Sackville, New Brunswick]]\n| League           = [[U Sports]]\n| ConferenceDisplay= AUS (1955-present)\n| ConferenceLink   = Atlantic University Sport\n| PastAffiliations = {{abbr|NBFL|New Brunswick Football League}} (1949-1957)<br>{{abbr|MIFL|Maritime Intercollegiate Football League}} (1958-1959)<br>{{abbr|AFC|Atlantic Football Conference}} (1960-1965)<br>{{abbr|MIAA|Maritime Intercollegiate Athletic Association}} (1966-1968)<br>{{abbr|AIAA|Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association}} (1969-1973)<br>[[Atlantic Universities Athletic Association|AUAA]] (1974-1998)<br>[[Atlantic University Sport]] (1999-present)\n| ATWins           = 166\n| ATLosses         = 204\n| ATTies           = 0\n| Wins             =  \n| Losses           = \n| VanierCups       = 0\n| AtlanticBowls    = 2<br>1984, 1991\n| JewettTrophies   = 6<br>1984, 1985, 1991, 1997, 2013, 2014\n| HecCrightons     = 2<br>[[\u00c9ric Lapointe (Canadian football)|\u00c9ric Lapointe]] (2)\n| Uniform          = \n| Colour1          = Garnet\n| Colour1Hex       = 872434\n| Colour2          = Gold\n| Colour2Hex       = AF8900\n| Colour3          = \n| Colour3Hex       = \n| FightSong        = \n| MascotDisplay    = \n| PagFreeLabel     = \n| PagFreeValue     = \n| PagFreeLabel2    = \n| PagFreeValue2    = \n| WebsiteName      = mountiepride.ca\n| WebsiteURL       = http://mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/index\n}}\nThe '''[[Mount Allison Mounties]] [[U Sports football|football]]''' team represents [[Mount Allison University]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], [[New Brunswick]] in the sport of [[Canadian football]] in [[U Sports]].

They followed up that campaign with their first undefeated season in the [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]], posting an 8-0 record en route to their second consecutive [[Jewett Trophy]] championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/2014-15/releases/20141025pi51hd |title=Mounties Complete Undefeated Regular Season With 18-10 Win Over StFX |publisher=[[Mount Allison Mounties]] |date=October 25, 2014 |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref> In 2015, the Mounties finished in first place in the [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]] regular season with a 5-3 record and hosted the [[Loney Bowl]] for the second consecutive season. They were also looking to win their third consecutive [[Jewett Trophy]] but would end up falling short to the [[St. Francis Xavier X-Men football|St. Francis Xavier X-Men]] 24-18. \n\n2016 would be the first season with Scott Brady as the team's new [[head coach]], who had been with the team as as assistant coach since 2010. Brady was the first permanent head coach in the program's recent history who was both a Mount Allison graduate and former player for the Mounties. The team ended up making the playoffs as the second place team. They would defeat the [[Acadia Axemen football|Acadia Axemen]] 27-18 to compete in their fourth straight Loney Bowl but would end up losing to the St. Francis Xavier X-Men 29-8. In 2017, the team would see their five-year playoff streak come to an end as they missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011. \n\nFollowing a coaching change, with Peter Fraser as the team's new head coach, the team would regress further with a 2-6 record. In 2019, the team lost their first four games of the season, but then won their next three and eventually finished with a 3-5 record and enough to qualify for the playoffs.\n\n==Recent regular season results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

A league All-Star and All-Canadian in 1996 and 1997, Girard was also a nominee for the President's Trophy as the country's Most Outstanding Defensive Player in 1997, winning the Atlantic Conference's honour in that category. The following spring, in the 1998 Canadian Football League's (CFL) Canadian College Draft, he became the highest-drafted Mountie ever, going in the first round 5th overall to the Edmonton Eskimos. He played there for several seasons before joining former Mountie teammate \u00c9ric Lapointe as a member of Montreal Alouettes, retiring as a member of the Alouettes.\n*[[\u00c9ric Lapointe (Canadian football)|Eric Lapointe]] (\u201900) represents more than just records and statistics, although he dominated both areas of the sport during his four years as a Mountie.  He was looked to by his teammates for on-field and locker-room inspiration, and he did not disappoint. Drafted by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], Lapointe ended up with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] in 1999 where he rushed for 691 yards during the season, helping his team to the [[Grey Cup]] in which he was the game's leading ground gainer.  Traded to [[Toronto Argonauts|Toronto]], he ultimately ended his career with his hometown [[Montreal Alouettes]]. In his final season he was the starting running back in the Grey Cup game. Eric retired with the Alouettes in 2006 after their [[96th Grey Cup|Grey Cup loss]] to the [[BC Lions]].<ref name=\"Lapointe\"/> In 2012 he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame for his career as a Mountie.<ref name=CFHOF/>\n*Gary Ross (\u201911) The football team\u2019s most valuable player in recent years, Ross had an unprecedented football season in 2009, breaking several school and conference records along the way. Leading the league in most of the special teams and receiving categories, the five-foot-nine Ross was selected as the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) conference\u2019s MVP and was a strong nominee for the nation\u2019s most outstanding player award \u2014 the [[Hec Crighton Trophy]]. While he narrowly missed this honour he was still recognized with two All-Canadian awards for the second consecutive season. A four-time AUS Player of the Week, he was named both as a first-team Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) All-Canadian inside receiver, and a second-team CIS All-Canadian return specialist. He led the Atlantic conference in receptions (60), receiving yards (818 yards), receiving touchdowns (four), and all-purpose yards (1,423 yards). He has been an all-star receiver and the conference\u2019s top special teams player in each of his four years at Mount Allison, and is now the AUS career leader in receptions (172), receiving yards (2,582), and all-purpose yards (5,990 yards). This season he was the only Atlantic conference player to average over 100 yards receiving per game (102.2 yards per game) and his 60 receptions are also a new AUS single-season record, smashing the previous mark of 48. His 818 receiving yards are a new Mounties\u2019 single-season school record and the fourth highest total in league history. He currently ranks second in AUS history with 1,679 career punt return yards and 1,403 career kickoff return yards.\n*[[John Reardon]] ('97) Canadian all-star player for Mount Allison who became an [[actor]] for television and film.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/coaches/index Mounties official site]\n\n{{U Sports football}}\n\n[[Category:U Sports teams]]\n[[Category:U Sports football teams]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in New Brunswick]]\n[[Category:Mount Allison University]]\n", "name_user": "Benstown", "label": "safe", "comment": "svg logo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Allison_Mounties_football"}

The ministry was established in 1814 as the Royal Ministry of Church and Education Affairs.\n\nThe current Minister of Education and Integration is [[Guri Melby]] of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and the current Minister of Research and Higher Education is [[Henrik Asheim]] of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThe department reports to the legislature ([[Storting]]et). Traditionally this ministry was also responsible for church affairs, but this function was transferred to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs|Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]] in 2002.\n\n==History==\n\nThe ministry was established in 1814, following the dissolution of the united kingdom of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], in which the joint central government administration of the two formally separate but closely integrated kingdoms had been based in [[Copenhagen]]. Originally named the Ministry of Church and Education Affairs, the ministry was the first of six government ministries established in 1814, and was also known as the First Ministry. The other ministries were the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Police, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of War. Although Norway was in a loose [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]] with a common foreign and defence policy until 1905, church and education policy was entirely the domain of the respective national governments.\n\n==Organisations==\n===Political staff<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/about-the-ministry/other-political-staff.html?id=608 Ministry of Education and Research \u2013 Political staff]</ref>===\n* [[Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8e Isaksen]], minister of Education and Research ([[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]])\n* State Secretaries, [[Bj\u00f8rn Haugstad]] and [[Birgitte Jordahl]]\n* Political Adviser, [[Magnus Thue]]\n\n===Departments===\n* Department of Administration and Development\n* Department of Early Childhood Education and Care<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/About-the-Ministry/Organisation.html?id=610 |title=Organisation |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research}}</ref>\n* Department of Education and Training\n* Department of Governance and Finance\n* Department of Higher Education\n* Department of Policy Analysis, Lifelong Learning and International Affairs\n* Department of Research\n* The Communication Unit\n\n===Subsidiaries===\nThe following [[etat|government agencies]] are subordinate to the ministry:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dep/Underliggende-etater.html?id=115208 |title=Underliggende etater |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n* [[Research Council of Norway]] ''Norges forskningsr\u00e5d'' ([http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home_page/1177315753906 Official site]) In charge of research funding and research policy.\n* [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]], or ''Utdanningsdirektoratetet'' ([http://www.udir.no Official site]) Responsible for the development of primary and secondary education.

The ministry was established in 1814 as the Royal Ministry of Church and Education Affairs.\n\nThe current Minister of Education and Integration is [[Guri Melby]] of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and the current Minister of Research and Higher Education is [[Henrik Asheim]] of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThe department reports to the legislature ([[Storting]]et). Traditionally this ministry was also responsible for church affairs, but this function was transferred to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs|Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]] in 2002.\n\n==History==\n\nThe ministry was established in 1814, following the dissolution of the united kingdom of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], in which the joint central government administration of the two formally separate but closely integrated kingdoms had been based in [[Copenhagen]]. Originally named the Ministry of Church and Education Affairs, the ministry was the first of six government ministries established in 1814, and was also known as the First Ministry. The other ministries were the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Police, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of War. Although Norway was in a loose [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]] with a common foreign and defence policy until 1905, church and education policy was entirely the domain of the respective national governments.\n\n==Organisations==\n===Political staff<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/about-the-ministry/other-political-staff.html?id=608 Ministry of Education and Research \u2013 Political staff]</ref>===\n* [[Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8e Isaksen]], minister of Education and Research ([[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]])\n* State Secretaries, [[Bj\u00f8rn Haugstad]] and [[Birgitte Jordahl]]\n* Political Adviser, [[Magnus Thue]]\n\n===Departments===\n* Department of Administration and Development\n* Department of Early Childhood Education and Care<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/About-the-Ministry/Organisation.html?id=610 |title=Organisation |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research}}</ref>\n* Department of Education and Training\n* Department of Governance and Finance\n* Department of Higher Education\n* Department of Policy Analysis, Lifelong Learning and International Affairs\n* Department of Research\n* The Communication Unit\n\n===Subsidiaries===\nThe following [[etat|government agencies]] are subordinate to the ministry:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dep/Underliggende-etater.html?id=115208 |title=Underliggende etater |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n* [[Research Council of Norway]] ''Norges forskningsr\u00e5d'' ([http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home_page/1177315753906 Official site]) In charge of research funding and research policy.\n* [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]], or ''Utdanningsdirektoratetet'' ([http://www.udir.no Official site]) Responsible for the development of primary and secondary education.
