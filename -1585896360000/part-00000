{"title_page": "Messaging apps", "text_new": "{{other uses|Messaging application (disambiguation){{!}}Messaging application}}\n'''[[Message|Messaging]] apps''' (a.k.a. \"Social messaging\" or \"chat applications\") are apps and platforms that enable messaging, many of which started as adjunct to [[Social networking platform|social networking platforms]]. Many such apps have developed into broad platforms enabling status updates, [[chatbots]], [[payments]] and [[conversational commerce]] (e-commerce via chat).\n\nSome examples of popular messaging apps include [[WhatsApp]], [[Facebook Messenger|Facebook messenger]], China's [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ Messenger]], [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]], [[Viber]], [[Line (application)|Line]], and [[Snapchat]]. [[Slack (software)|Slack]] focuses on messaging and file sharing for work teams. Some social networking services offer messaging services as a component of their overall platform, such as [[Facebook]]'s [[Facebook Messenger]], along with [[Instagram]] and [[Twitter]]'s direct messaging functions.\n\nMessaging apps are the most widely used [[smartphone]] apps with in 2018 over 1.3 billion monthly users of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, 980 million [[monthly active users]] of WeChat and 843 million monthly active users of QQ Mobile.\n\n== History of messaging applications ==\nIn 1961, MIT\u2019s Computation Center built the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|Compatible Time Sharing System]] (CTSS) which facilitated communication via text message for up to 30 people.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://towcenter.gitbooks.io/guide-to-chat-apps/content/introductionthe_dawn_of/a_brief_history.html|title=A Brief History of Chat Apps \u00b7 Guide to Chat Apps|website=towcenter.gitbooks.io|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> The first dedicated online chat platform is recognized as [[CompuServe]]\u2019s CB Simulator, which was released in 1980 and required a monthly membership fee.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1996, Israeli firm [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] released ICQ (short for \u201cI Seek You\u201d), the first widely used online messenger platform.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1985, [[Quantum Link]] (or Q-Link) created an online service that allowed group chat, file sharing, email, games, and news with a modem connection.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1991, Quantum Link changed its name to [[America Online]] ([[AOL]]) and became the leading Internet service provider and web portal in the United States by the mid-1990s.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this time, modern instant messaging and SMS also started becoming widely used by the general public. AOL launched the widely known platform AOL Instant Messenger ([[AIM (software)|AIM]]) in 1997 and purchased Mirabilis\u2019 [[ICQ]] in 1998, establishing dominance in the instant messaging market.<ref name=\":0\" /> By 2006, AIM controlled 52 percent of the instant messaging market, but rapidly declined shortly thereafter as the company struggled to compete with other services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith increased globally increased smartphone usage, messaging apps surpassed SMS in message volume by 2013.<ref name=\":0\" /> In January of 2015, the service WhatsApp alone accommodated 30 billion messages daily in comparison to about 20 billion for SMS. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== User base over time ===\nAs of October 2019, the most used messaging apps worldwide are [[WhatsApp]] with 1.6 billion active users, [[Facebook Messenger|Facebook messenger]] with 1.3 billion users, and [[WeChat]] with 1.1 billion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.messengerpeople.com/global-messenger-usage-statistics/|title=Messaging App Usage Statistics Around the World|date=2020-02-12|website=MessengerPeople|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> There are only 25 countries in the world where WhatsApp is not the market leader in messaging apps and only 10 countries where the leading messenger app is not owned by Facebook.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Comparison to SMS and instant messaging==\n[[SMS]] is the acronym for \u201cshort service message\u201d and allows mobile phone users to send text messages without an Internet connection, while instant messaging provides the same functionality through an Internet connection.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://towcenter.gitbooks.io/guide-to-chat-apps/content/introductionthe_dawn_of/a_brief_history.html|title=A Brief History of Chat Apps \u00b7 Guide to Chat Apps|website=towcenter.gitbooks.io|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> SMS was a much more dominant form of communication until 2012, when smartphones became widely used globally. While SMS relied on traditional paid telephone services, messaging apps were available for free or a minor data charge. In 2012 SMS volume peaked, and in 2013 chat apps surpassed SMS in global message volume.\n\nEasier group messaging was another advantage of smartphone messaging apps and also contributed to their adoption. Before the introduction of messaging apps, smartphone users could only participate in single-person interactions via mobile voice calls or SMS. With the introduction of messaging apps, the group chat functionality allows all the members to see an entire thread of everyone's responses. Members can also respond directly to each other, rather than having to go through the member who started the group message, to relay the information.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ling|first=Rich|last2=Lai|first2=Chih-Hui|date=2016-10-01|title=Microcoordination 2.0: Social Coordination in the Age of Smartphones and Messaging Apps|url=https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/66/5/834/4082414|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=66|issue=5|pages=834\u2013856|doi=10.1111/jcom.12251|issn=0021-9916}}</ref>\n\nHowever, SMS still remains popular in the United States because it is usually included free in monthly phone bundles.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/487102/why-whatsapp-bombed-in-the-us-while-snapchat-and-kik-blew-up/|title=Why WhatsApp bombed in the US, while Snapchat and Kik blew up|last=Horwitz|first=Josh|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> While SMS volumes in some countries like Denmark, Spain and Singapore dropped up to two-thirds from 2011 to 2013, in the United States SMS use only dropped by about one quarter.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Effects of messaging applications on communication ==\nMessaging applications have affected the way people communicate on their devices.

The privacy aspect can also be enhanced as applications have a timer feature, like [[Snapchat]], where messages or conversations are automatically deleted once the time limit is reached. Public and group chat features allow users to communicate with multiple people at a time.\n\n=== Calls ===\nMany major messaging apps offer the call feature for user-to-user calls, conference calls, and voice messages. The call functionality is useful for professionals who utilize the application for work purposes and as a hands-free method. \n\n=== Games ===\nSome messaging applications include in-app games for entertainment. For example, the [[Facebook Messenger]] application has a built in option to play computer games with people in a chat, including games like [[Tetris]] and [[Blackjack]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itechfever.com/best-facebook-messenger-games/|title=17 Best Facebook Messenger Games To Play In 2020|date=2018-05-02|website=iTechFever|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Payments ===\nThough a relatively new feature, peer-to-peer payments are available on major messaging platforms. This functionality allows individuals to use one application for both communication and financial tasks.

SMS messages are not encrypted, making them insecure, as the content of each SMS message is visible to mobile carriers and governments and can be intercepted by a third party.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-encrypted-messaging-apps/|title=Cybersecurity 101: How to choose and use an encrypted messaging app|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> SMS messages also leak [[metadata]], or information about the message that is not the message content itself, such as phone numbers of the sender and recipient, which can identify the people involved in the conversation.<ref name=\":5\" /> SMS messages can also be spoofed and the sender of the message can be edited to impersonate another person.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMessaging applications on the market that use encryption include Signal, WhatsApp, Wire and iMessage (which uses [[end-to-end encryption]]).<ref name=\":5\" /> Applications that have been criticized for lacking or poor encryption methods include Telegram and Confide, as both are prone to error.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Future development ==\n\n=== Artificial Intelligence ===\n[[Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is commonly implemented in SMS messaging to handle large amounts of messages and data.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2019/11/mobile-messaging-artificial-intelligence-advancements/|title=Taking the Mess Out of Messaging|date=2019-11-26|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> AI technology first classifies the content of each message as personal, promotional, or transactional.<ref name=\":1\" /> It then filters through the message to display key information for each mobile user.<ref name=\":1\" /> As it trains itself by sorting millions of sample messages to take into account syntax and semantic patterns per each message, it learns to classify messages and extract key components of each message, such as dates, numbers, and other information.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Machine Learning ===\nIn 2016, Google introduced a new intelligent messaging app that incorporates machine learning technology called Allo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-18-google-allo.html|title=Google's Allo puts AI in a messaging app|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Instant messaging]]\n*[[Social media]]\n*[[Text messaging]]\n*[[SMS]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* {{ cite web | url = http://blogs.rediff.com/thinko/2019/09/12/meet-the-new-age-creators-from-bharat-helos-platform-empowering-local-content-creators-2/\n | publisher = Rediff.com| title = Meet the new-age creators from 'Bharat' - Helo's platform empowering local content creators }}\n\n{{Mobile phones}}\n{{Instant messaging}}\n\n[[Category:Social networking services]]\n[[Category:Instant messaging]]\n[[Category:Online chat]]\n[[Category:Text messaging]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Messaging application (disambiguation){{!}}Messaging application}}\n'''[[Message|Messaging]] apps''' (a.k.a. \"Social messaging\" or \"chat applications\") are apps and platforms that enable messaging, many of which started as adjunct to [[Social networking platform|social networking platforms]]. Many such apps have developed into broad platforms enabling status updates, [[chatbots]], [[payments]] and [[conversational commerce]] (e-commerce via chat).\n\nSome examples of popular messaging apps include [[WhatsApp]], [[Facebook Messenger|Facebook messenger]], China's [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ Messenger]], [[Viber]], [[Line (application)|Line]], and [[Snapchat]].

AOL launched the widely known platform AOL Instant Messenger ([[AIM (software)|AIM]]) in 1997 and purchased Mirabilis\u2019 [[ICQ]] in 1998, establishing dominance in the instant messaging market.<ref name=\":0\" /> By 2006, AIM controlled 52 percent of the instant messaging market, but rapidly declined shortly thereafter as the company struggled to compete with other services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith increased globally increased smartphone usage, messaging apps surpassed SMS in message volume by 2013.<ref name=\":0\" /> In January of 2015, the service WhatsApp alone accommodated 30 billion messages daily in comparison to about 20 billion for SMS. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== User base over time ===\nAs of October 2019, the most used messaging apps worldwide are [[WhatsApp]] with 1.6 billion active users, [[Facebook Messenger|Facebook messenger]] with 1.3 billion users, and [[WeChat]] with 1.1 billion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.messengerpeople.com/global-messenger-usage-statistics/|title=Messaging App Usage Statistics Around the World|date=2020-02-12|website=MessengerPeople|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> There are only 25 countries in the world where WhatsApp is not the market leader in messaging apps and only 10 countries where the leading messenger app is not owned by Facebook.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Comparison to SMS and instant messaging==\n[[SMS]] is the acronym for \u201cshort service message\u201d and allows mobile phone users to send text messages without an Internet connection, while instant messaging provides the same functionality through an Internet connection.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://towcenter.gitbooks.io/guide-to-chat-apps/content/introductionthe_dawn_of/a_brief_history.html|title=A Brief History of Chat Apps \u00b7 Guide to Chat Apps|website=towcenter.gitbooks.io|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> SMS was a much more dominant form of communication until 2012, when smartphones became widely used globally. While SMS relied on traditional paid telephone services, messaging apps were available for free or a minor data charge. In 2012 SMS volume peaked, and in 2013 chat apps surpassed SMS in global message volume.\n\nEasier group messaging was another advantage of smartphone messaging apps and also contributed to their adoption. Before the introduction of messaging apps, smartphone users could only participate in single-person interactions via mobile voice calls or SMS. With the introduction of messaging apps, the group chat functionality allows all the members to see an entire thread of everyone's responses. Members can also respond directly to each other, rather than having to go through the member who started the group message, to relay the information.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ling|first=Rich|last2=Lai|first2=Chih-Hui|date=2016-10-01|title=Microcoordination 2.0: Social Coordination in the Age of Smartphones and Messaging Apps|url=https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/66/5/834/4082414|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=66|issue=5|pages=834\u2013856|doi=10.1111/jcom.12251|issn=0021-9916}}</ref>\n\nHowever, SMS still remains popular in the United States because it is usually included free in monthly phone bundles.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/487102/why-whatsapp-bombed-in-the-us-while-snapchat-and-kik-blew-up/|title=Why WhatsApp bombed in the US, while Snapchat and Kik blew up|last=Horwitz|first=Josh|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> While SMS volumes in some countries like Denmark, Spain and Singapore dropped up to two-thirds from 2011 to 2013, in the United States SMS use only dropped by about one quarter.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Effects of messaging applications on communication ==\nMessaging applications have affected the way people communicate on their devices.

The privacy aspect can also be enhanced as applications have a timer feature, like [[Snapchat]], where messages or conversations are automatically deleted once the time limit is reached. Public and group chat features allow users to communicate with multiple people at a time.\n\n=== Calls ===\nMany major messaging apps offer the call feature for user-to-user calls, conference calls, and voice messages. The call functionality is useful for professionals who utilize the application for work purposes and as a hands-free method. \n\n=== Games ===\nSome messaging applications include in-app games for entertainment. For example, the [[Facebook Messenger]] application has a built in option to play computer games with people in a chat, including games like [[Tetris]] and [[Blackjack]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itechfever.com/best-facebook-messenger-games/|title=17 Best Facebook Messenger Games To Play In 2020|date=2018-05-02|website=iTechFever|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Payments ===\nThough a relatively new feature, peer-to-peer payments are available on major messaging platforms. This functionality allows individuals to use one application for both communication and financial tasks. The lack of a service fee also makes messaging apps advantageous to financial applications like [[Venmo]] or [[PayPal]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobilemarketer.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/messaging/21840.html|title=Why messaging apps are striking gold with peer-to-peer payments {{!}} Mobile Marketer|website=www.mobilemarketer.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> Major platforms such as Facebook messenger and [[WeChat]] already offer a payment feature, and this functionality is likely to become a standard amongst messaging apps competing in the market.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Encryption ==\n[[Encryption]] is the primary method that messaging apps use to protect user\u2019s data privacy and security.
