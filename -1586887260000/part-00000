He has developed a style of playing piano he terms \"soft pedal\".\n\n==Early life==\nBudd was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and spent his childhood in [[Victorville, California]] by the [[Mojave Desert]].<ref name=\"Audiophile\"/> While serving in the army, he joined the regimental band where he played drums. Jazz saxophonist [[Albert Ayler]] was drafted at the same time and  was also a member of the band. Budd joined him in gigs around the [[Monterey]] area.<ref name=\"Audiophile\">{{cite web|url=https://theaudiophileman.com/box-budd-talking-harold-budd/|title=A Box of Budd: Talking to Harold Budd|publisher=theaudiophileman.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Education and academic career==\nBudd's career as a composer began in 1962. In the following years, he gained a notable reputation in the local avant-garde community.<ref name=\"Leone\">{{cite web|url=https://fdleone.com/2016/05/24/harold-budd-utterly-no-interest-in-labels/|title=Harold Budd: utterly no interest in labels|publisher=FDLeone.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> In 1966, he graduated from the [[University of Southern California]] (having studied under [[Ingolf Dahl]]) with a degree in musical composition. As he progressed, his compositions became increasingly [[minimalism|minimalist]]. Among his more experimental works were two [[drone music]] pieces, \"Coeur d'Orr\" and \"The Oak of the Golden Dreams\". After composing a long-form [[gong]] solo titled \"Lirio\", he felt he had reached the limits of his experiments in minimalism and the avant-garde. He retired temporarily from composition in 1970 and began a teaching career at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].[http://www.nndb.com/people/738/000113399/ [1<nowiki>]</nowiki>]\n\n\"The road from my first colored graph piece in 1962 to my renunciation of composing in 1970 to my resurfacing as a composer in 1972 was a process of trying out an idea and when it was obviously successful abandoning it. The early graph piece was followed by the Rothko orchestra work, the pieces for ''Source Magazine'', the [[Morton Feldman|Feldman]]-derived chamber works, the pieces typed out or written in [[longhand]], the out-and-out conceptual works among other things, and the model drone works (which include the sax and organ \"Coeur d'Orr\" and \"The Oak of the Golden Dreams\", the latter based on the [[Bali]]nese \"[[Slendro]]\" scale which scale I used again 18 years later on \"The Real Dream of Sails\").<ref name=\"Leone\"/>\n\n\"In 1970 with the \"Candy-Apple Revision\" (unspecified D-flat major) and \"Lirio\" (solo gong \"for a long duration\") I realized I had minimalized myself out of a career. It had taken ten years to reduce my language to zero but I loved the process of seeing it occur and not knowing when the end would come. By then I had opted out of avant-garde music generally; it seemed self-congratulatory and risk-free and my solution as to what to do next was to do nothing, to stop completely.\"\n\n\"I resurfaced as an artist in 1972 with \"Madrigals of the Rose Angel\", the first of what would be a cycle of works under the collective title ''[[The Pavilion of Dreams]]''. ''Madrigals'' refused to accommodate or even acknowledge any issues in new music. The entire aesthetic was an existential prettiness; not the [[Plato]]nic \"to Kalon\", but simply pretty: mindless, shallow and utterly devastating. Female chorus, harp and percussion seemed like a beautiful start. Its first performance was at a Franciscan church in California conducted by [[Daniel Lentz]].\"<ref >{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Pavilion of Dreams|title-link=The Pavilion of Dreams |year=1992|page=2|type=booklet |publisher=EG}} </ref>\n\n==Composer and recording artist==\nIn 1972, while still retaining his teaching career, he resurfaced as a composer. Spanning from 1972\u20131975 he created four individual works under the collective title \"The Pavilion of Dreams\". The style of these works was an unusual blend of popular jazz and the avant-garde. In 1976 he resigned from the institute and began recording his new compositions, produced by British ambient pioneer [[Brian Eno]]. Two years later, Harold Budd's debut album ''The Pavilion of Dreams'' was released.\n\nBudd has developed a style of playing piano he terms \"soft pedal,\" which can be described as slow and sustained. While he is often placed in the Ambient category, he emphatically declares that he is not an Ambient artist, and feels that he got \"kidnapped\" into the category.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoffer|first=Jason|title=Drinking Scotch, smoking cigarettes, and hanging out with Feldman, Rothko and Budd|url=http://goingthruvinyl.com/wp/2012/06/drinking-scotch-smoking-cigerettes-and-hanging-out-with-feldman-rothko-and-budd-listen-3700s02-ep11-part-1-of-2/|publisher=Going Thru Vinyl Ltd.|accessdate=September 21, 2012|author2=Harold Budd|location=9:00|format=audio (mp3)}}</ref> His two collaborations with Brian Eno, ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Pearl (album)|The Pearl]]'', established his trademark atmospheric piano style. On ''[[Lovely Thunder]]'' he introduced subtle electronic textures. His thematic 2000 release ''[[The Room (album)|The Room]]'' saw a return to a more minimalist approach. In 2003, [[Daniel Lanois]], the renowned producer of [[U2]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and occasional collaborator with Brian Eno, recorded an impromptu performance of Harold playing the piano in his Los Angeles living room, unaware, and thus realized the album ''La Bella Vista''.\n\nHis album ''[[Avalon Sutra / As Long as I Can Hold My Breath|Avalon Sutra]]'' from 2004 was billed as \"Harold Budd's Last Recorded Work\" by [[David Sylvian]]'s independent record label [[Samadhi Sound|Samadhisound]]. Their press release continued: \"''Avalon Sutra'' brings to a conclusion thirty years of sustained musical activity. Asked for his reasons, Budd says only that he feels that he has said what he has to say. With characteristic humility, he concludes, \"I don\u2019t mind disappearing!\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samadhisound.com/archive/harold_budd_avalon_sutra.html|title=Harold Budd \"Avalon Sutra\"|publisher=Samadhisound.com|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> A farewell concert retrospective was performed at The Disney Theater/REDCAT in Los Angeles in September 2004 with Budd playing solo and with guests [[Jon Gibson (minimalist musician)|Jon Gibson]], [[Clive Wright (musician)|Clive Wright]] and more. It featured music from Budd's \"Avalon Sutra\", and as far back as \"Lirio\". A second farewell concert featuring Budd and guest-starring many of the musicians he had worked with throughout his career was presented at [[Brighton Dome]] in May 2005, also billed as being Budd's last public performance. In spite of this, Budd's soundtrack to the film [[Mysterious Skin - Music from the Film|''Mysterious Skin'']] (a collaboration with [[Robin Guthrie]]) and ''[[Music for 'Fragments from the Inside']]'' (with [[Eraldo Bernocchi]]) were both released in 2005.\n\nIn February 2007, Samadhisound released ''Perhaps'', a live recording of Budd's improvised performance at CalArts on December 6, 2006 in tribute to his late friend (and associate teacher at the then newly formed [[California Institute of Arts]]) [[James Tenney]].\n\nIn April 2007, Samadhisound released a podcast of Harold Budd in conversation with [[Akira Rabelais]]. In this (Samadhisound Podcast #2), Harold said although he had believed at the time of recording ''Avalon Sutra'' that it would be his last album, he no longer felt that way. \"It was a time in my life when things weren't just falling together for me, and I thought that I was just going to let it all slide ... and I was sincere about it but if I had been more conscious of my real feelings and had explored my inner sanctum more I would've seen that it was a preposterous thing to do ... I was dreadfully lonely; I was living alone in the desert and had been for too long, really, and I felt that isolation very severely after a while, and it's probably a version of self-pity, I'm sorry to say, to have publicly said something like that, but there it is, I said it, turns out I wasn't telling the truth \u2013 I didn't know it at the time.\"\n\nIn June 2007, [[Darla Records]] released two CDs by Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd: ''[[After the Night Falls]]'' and ''[[Before the Day Breaks]]''.

He has developed a style of playing piano he terms \"soft pedal\".\n\n==Early life==\nBudd was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and spent his childhood in [[Victorville, California]] by the [[Mojave Desert]].<ref name=\"Audiophile\"/> While serving in the army, he joined the regimental band where he played drums. Jazz saxophonist [[Albert Ayler]] was drafted at the same time and  was also a member of the band. Budd joined him in gigs around the [[Monterey]] area.<ref name=\"Audiophile\">{{cite web|url=https://theaudiophileman.com/box-budd-talking-harold-budd/|title=A Box of Budd: Talking to Harold Budd|publisher=theaudiophileman.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Education and academic career==\nBudd's career as a composer began in 1962. In the following years, he gained a notable reputation in the local avant-garde community.<ref name=\"Leone\">{{cite web|url=https://fdleone.com/2016/05/24/harold-budd-utterly-no-interest-in-labels/|title=Harold Budd: utterly no interest in labels|publisher=FDLeone.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> In 1966, he graduated from the [[University of Southern California]] (having studied under [[Ingolf Dahl]]) with a degree in musical composition. As he progressed, his compositions became increasingly [[minimalism|minimalist]]. Among his more experimental works were two [[drone music]] pieces, \"Coeur d'Orr\" and \"The Oak of the Golden Dreams\". After composing a long-form [[gong]] solo titled \"Lirio\", he felt he had reached the limits of his experiments in minimalism and the avant-garde. He retired temporarily from composition in 1970 and began a teaching career at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].[http://www.nndb.com/people/738/000113399/ [1<nowiki>]</nowiki>]\n\n\"The road from my first colored graph piece in 1962 to my renunciation of composing in 1970 to my resurfacing as a composer in 1972 was a process of trying out an idea and when it was obviously successful abandoning it. The early graph piece was followed by the Rothko orchestra work, the pieces for ''Source Magazine'', the [[Morton Feldman|Feldman]]-derived chamber works, the pieces typed out or written in [[longhand]], the out-and-out conceptual works among other things, and the model drone works (which include the sax and organ \"Coeur d'Orr\" and \"The Oak of the Golden Dreams\", the latter based on the [[Bali]]nese \"[[Slendro]]\" scale which scale I used again 18 years later on \"The Real Dream of Sails\").<ref name=\"Leone\"/>\n\n\"In 1970 with the \"Candy-Apple Revision\" (unspecified D-flat major) and \"Lirio\" (solo gong \"for a long duration\") I realized I had minimalized myself out of a career. It had taken ten years to reduce my language to zero but I loved the process of seeing it occur and not knowing when the end would come. By then I had opted out of avant-garde music generally; it seemed self-congratulatory and risk-free and my solution as to what to do next was to do nothing, to stop completely.\"\n\n\"I resurfaced as an artist in 1972 with \"Madrigals of the Rose Angel\", the first of what would be a cycle of works under the collective title ''[[The Pavilion of Dreams]]''. ''Madrigals'' refused to accommodate or even acknowledge any issues in new music. The entire aesthetic was an existential prettiness; not the [[Plato]]nic \"to Kalon\", but simply pretty: mindless, shallow and utterly devastating. Female chorus, harp and percussion seemed like a beautiful start. Its first performance was at a Franciscan church in California conducted by [[Daniel Lentz]].\"<ref >{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Pavilion of Dreams|title-link=The Pavilion of Dreams |year=1992|page=2|type=booklet |publisher=EG}} </ref>\n\n==Composer and recording artist==\nIn 1972, while still retaining his teaching career, he resurfaced as a composer. Spanning from 1972\u20131975 he created four individual works under the collective title \"The Pavilion of Dreams\". The style of these works was an unusual blend of popular jazz and the avant-garde. In 1976 he resigned from the institute and began recording his new compositions, produced by British ambient pioneer [[Brian Eno]]. Two years later, Harold Budd's debut album ''The Pavilion of Dreams'' was released.\n\nBudd has developed a style of playing piano he terms \"soft pedal,\" which can be described as slow and sustained. While he is often placed in the Ambient category, he emphatically declares that he is not an Ambient artist, and feels that he got \"kidnapped\" into the category.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoffer|first=Jason|title=Drinking Scotch, smoking cigarettes, and hanging out with Feldman, Rothko and Budd|url=http://goingthruvinyl.com/wp/2012/06/drinking-scotch-smoking-cigerettes-and-hanging-out-with-feldman-rothko-and-budd-listen-3700s02-ep11-part-1-of-2/|publisher=Going Thru Vinyl Ltd.|accessdate=September 21, 2012|author2=Harold Budd|location=9:00|format=audio (mp3)}}</ref> His two collaborations with Brian Eno, ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Pearl (album)|The Pearl]]'', established his trademark atmospheric piano style. On ''[[Lovely Thunder]]'' he introduced subtle electronic textures. His thematic 2000 release ''[[The Room (album)|The Room]]'' saw a return to a more minimalist approach. In 2003, [[Daniel Lanois]], the renowned producer of [[U2]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and occasional collaborator with Brian Eno, recorded an impromptu performance of Harold playing the piano in his Los Angeles living room, unaware, and thus realized the album ''La Bella Vista''.\n\nHis album ''[[Avalon Sutra / As Long as I Can Hold My Breath|Avalon Sutra]]'' from 2004 was billed as \"Harold Budd's Last Recorded Work\" by [[David Sylvian]]'s independent record label [[Samadhi Sound|Samadhisound]]. Their press release continued: \"''Avalon Sutra'' brings to a conclusion thirty years of sustained musical activity. Asked for his reasons, Budd says only that he feels that he has said what he has to say. With characteristic humility, he concludes, \"I don\u2019t mind disappearing!\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samadhisound.com/archive/harold_budd_avalon_sutra.html|title=Harold Budd \"Avalon Sutra\"|publisher=Samadhisound.com|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> A farewell concert retrospective was performed at The Disney Theater/REDCAT in Los Angeles in September 2004 with Budd playing solo and with guests [[Jon Gibson (minimalist musician)|Jon Gibson]], [[Clive Wright (musician)|Clive Wright]] and more. It featured music from Budd's \"Avalon Sutra\", and as far back as \"Lirio\". A second farewell concert featuring Budd and guest-starring many of the musicians he had worked with throughout his career was presented at [[Brighton Dome]] in May 2005, also billed as being Budd's last public performance. In spite of this, Budd's soundtrack to the film [[Mysterious Skin - Music from the Film|''Mysterious Skin'']] (a collaboration with [[Robin Guthrie]]) and ''[[Music for 'Fragments from the Inside']]'' (with [[Eraldo Bernocchi]]) were both released in 2005.\n\nIn February 2007, Samadhisound released ''Perhaps'', a live recording of Budd's improvised performance at CalArts on December 6, 2006 in tribute to his late friend (and associate teacher at the then newly formed [[California Institute of Arts]]) [[James Tenney]].\n\nIn April 2007, Samadhisound released a podcast of Harold Budd in conversation with [[Akira Rabelais]]. In this (Samadhisound Podcast #2), Harold said although he had believed at the time of recording ''Avalon Sutra'' that it would be his last album, he no longer felt that way. \"It was a time in my life when things weren't just falling together for me, and I thought that I was just going to let it all slide ... and I was sincere about it but if I had been more conscious of my real feelings and had explored my inner sanctum more I would've seen that it was a preposterous thing to do ... I was dreadfully lonely; I was living alone in the desert and had been for too long, really, and I felt that isolation very severely after a while, and it's probably a version of self-pity, I'm sorry to say, to have publicly said something like that, but there it is, I said it, turns out I wasn't telling the truth \u2013 I didn't know it at the time.\"\n\nIn June 2007, [[Darla Records]] released two CDs by Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd: ''[[After the Night Falls]]'' and ''[[Before the Day Breaks]]''. Recorded in Spring 2006, each features nine tracks with linked titles, e.g. \"How Distant Your Heart\"/\"How Close Your Soul\" and \"I Returned Her Glance\"/\"And Then I Turned Away\".<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/robin-guthrie-harold-budd-after-the-night-falls/|title=\nRobin Guthrie & Harold Budd After the Night Falls|publisher=popmatters.com|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, Darla Records released a collaboration with Clive Wright entitled ''Song for Lost Blossoms''.

{"title_page": "Two-body problem in general relativity", "text_new": "{{short description|Interaction of two bodies in general relativity}}\n{{General relativity sidebar|phenomena}}\n{{confuse|gravitational two-body problem|Kepler problem}}\nThe '''two-body problem in general relativity''' is the determination of the motion and [[gravitational field]] of two bodies as described by the [[field equation]]s of [[general relativity]]. Solving the [[Kepler problem]] is essential to calculate the bending of light by gravity and the motion of a [[planet]] orbiting its sun.  Solutions are also used to describe the motion of [[binary star]]s around each other, and estimate their gradual loss of energy through [[gravitational radiation]]. It is customary to assume that both bodies are point-like, so that [[tidal force]]s and the specifics of their material composition can be neglected.\n\nGeneral relativity describes the gravitational field by curved space-time; the [[Einstein equation|field equations governing this curvature]] are [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] and therefore difficult to solve in a [[closed-form expression|closed form]].  No exact solutions of the Kepler problem have been found, but an approximate solution has: the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]].  This solution pertains when the mass ''M'' of one body is overwhelmingly greater than the mass ''m'' of the other.  If so, the larger mass may be taken as stationary and the sole contributor to the gravitational field.  This is a good approximation for a photon passing a star and for a planet orbiting its sun.   The motion of the lighter body (called the \"particle\" below) can then be determined from the Schwarzschild solution; the motion is a  [[geodesic]] (\"shortest path between two points\") in the curved space-time.  Such geodesic solutions account for the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous precession]] of the [[Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury]], which is a key piece of evidence supporting the theory of general relativity.  They also describe the bending of light in a gravitational field, another prediction [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|famously used as evidence]] for general relativity.\n\nIf both masses are considered to contribute to the gravitational field, as in binary stars, the Kepler problem can be solved only approximately.  The earliest approximation method to be developed was the [[post-Newtonian expansion]], an iterative method in which an initial solution is gradually corrected.  More recently, it has become possible to solve Einstein's field equation using a computer<ref name=\"Pretorius2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Pretorius|first1=Frans|title=Evolution of Binary Black-Hole Spacetimes|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=95|issue=12|pages=121101|year=2005|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.121101|pmid=16197061|arxiv = gr-qc/0507014 |bibcode = 2005PhRvL..95l1101P }}</ref><ref name=\"CampanelliLousto2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Campanelli|first1=M.|last2=Lousto|first2=C.

Typical elliptical path of a smaller mass ''m'' orbiting a much larger mass ''M''.  The larger mass is also moving on an elliptical orbit, but it is too small to be seen because ''M'' is much greater than ''m''.  The ends of the diameter indicate the [[apsis|apsides]], the points of closest and farthest distance. ]]\n\nThe Kepler problem derives its name from [[Johannes Kepler]], who worked as an assistant to the Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]].  Brahe took extraordinarily accurate measurements of the motion of the planets of the Solar System.  From these measurements, Kepler was able to formulate [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]], the first modern description of planetary motion:\n#The [[orbit]] of every [[planet]] is an [[ellipse]] with the Sun at one of the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]].\n#A [[line (geometry)|line]] joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal [[area]]s during equal intervals of time.\n#The [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[orbital period]] of a planet is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit.\nKepler published the first two laws in 1609 and the third law in 1619.  They supplanted earlier models of the Solar System, such as those of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]].  Kepler's laws apply only in the limited case of the two-body problem.  [[Voltaire]] and [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] were the first to call them \"Kepler's laws\".\n\nNearly a century later, [[Isaac Newton]] had formulated his [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]].  In particular, Newton's second law states that a force ''F'' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration ''a'' given by the equation ''F''=''ma''.  Newton then posed the question: what must the force be that produces the elliptical orbits seen by Kepler?  His answer came in his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], which states that the force between a mass ''M'' and another mass ''m'' is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\nF = G \\frac{M m}{r^2}\n</math>,\n\nwhere ''r'' is the distance between the masses and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].  Given this force law and his equations of motion, Newton was able to show that two point masses attracting each other would each follow perfectly elliptical orbits.  The ratio of sizes of these ellipses is ''m''/''M'', with the larger mass moving on a smaller ellipse.  If ''M'' is much larger than ''m'', then the larger mass will appear to be stationary at the focus of the elliptical orbit of the lighter mass ''m''.  This model can be applied approximately to the Solar System.  Since the mass of the Sun is much larger than those of the planets, the force acting on each planet is principally due to the Sun; the gravity of the planets for each other can be neglected to first approximation.\n\n===Apsidal precession===\n\n{{See also|Apsidal precession|Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector}}\n\n[[File:Precessing Kepler orbit 280frames e0.6 smaller.gif|thumb|right|345px|In the absence of any other forces, a particle orbiting another under the influence of Newtonian gravity follows the same perfect [[ellipse]] eternally.  The presence of other forces (such as the gravitation of other planets), causes this ellipse to rotate gradually.  The rate of this rotation (called orbital precession) can be measured very accurately.  The rate can also be predicted knowing the magnitudes and directions of the other forces.  However, the predictions of Newtonian gravity do not match the observations, as discovered in 1859 from observations of Mercury.]]\n\nIf the potential energy between the two bodies is not exactly the 1/''r'' potential of Newton's gravitational law but differs only slightly, then the ellipse of the orbit gradually rotates (among other possible effects).  This [[apsidal precession]] is observed for all the planets orbiting the Sun, primarily due to the oblateness of the Sun (it is not perfectly spherical) and the attractions of the other planets to one another.  The apsides are the two points of closest and furthest distance of the orbit (the periapsis and apoapsis, respectively); apsidal precession corresponds to the rotation of the line joining the apsides. It also corresponds to the rotation of the [[Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector]], which points along the line of apsides.\n\nNewton's law of gravitation soon became accepted because it gave very accurate predictions of the motion of all the planets.{{dubious|reason=Mercury's value would have been off by ~10% due to general relativity; the total precessions of other planets are smaller than the error in Mercury's value, so could not have been measured to be non-zero at all if accuracy was so low not to notice Mercury's anomlay|date=January 2013}}  These calculations were carried out initially by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the late 18th century, and refined by [[F\u00e9lix Tisserand]] in the later 19th century.  Conversely, if Newton's law of gravitation did ''not'' predict the apsidal precessions of the planets accurately, it would have to be discarded as a theory of gravitation.  Such an anomalous precession was observed in the second half of the 19th century.\n\n===Anomalous precession of Mercury===\n{{See also|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nIn 1859, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] discovered that the orbital [[precession]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was not quite what it should be; the ellipse of its orbit was rotating (precessing) slightly faster than predicted by the traditional theory of Newtonian gravity, even after all the effects of the other planets had been accounted for.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Le Verrier | first = UJJ | authorlink = Urbain Le Verrier | year = 1859 | title = Unknown title | journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]] | volume = 49 | pages = 379&ndash;?}}</ref>  The effect is small (roughly 43 [[arcsecond]]s of rotation per century), but well above the measurement error (roughly 0.1 [[arcsecond]]s per century).  Le Verrier realized the importance of his discovery immediately, and challenged astronomers and physicists alike to account for it.  Several classical explanations were proposed, such as interplanetary dust, unobserved oblateness of the [[Sun]], an undetected moon of Mercury, or a new planet named [[Vulcan (planet)|Vulcan]].<ref name=\"pais_1982\"/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}  After these explanations were discounted, some physicists were driven to the more radical hypothesis that [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[inverse-square law]] of gravitation was incorrect.  For example, some physicists proposed a [[power law]] with an [[exponent]] that was slightly different from 2.<ref name=\"pais_1982\"/>{{rp|254}}\n\nOthers argued that Newton's law should be supplemented with a velocity-dependent potential. However, this implied a conflict with Newtonian celestial dynamics. In his treatise on celestial mechanics, [[Laplace]] had shown that if the gravitational influence does not act instantaneously, then the motions of the planets themselves will not exactly conserve momentum (and consequently some of the momentum  would have to be ascribed to the mediator of the gravitational interaction, analogous to ascribing momentum to the mediator of the electromagnetic interaction.) As seen from a Newtonian point of view, if gravitational influence does propagate at a finite speed, then at all points in time a planet is attracted to a point where the Sun was some time before, and not towards the instantaneous position of the Sun. On the assumption of the classical fundamentals, Laplace had shown that if gravity would propagate at a velocity on the order of the speed of light then the solar system would be unstable, and would not exist for a long time. The observation that the solar system is old enough allowed him to put a lower limit on the [[speed of gravity]] that turned out to be many orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light.<ref name=\"pais_1982\">Pais 1982</ref><ref name=\"KopeikinEfroimsky2011\">{{cite book|author1=Sergei Kopeikin|author2=Michael Efroimsky|author3=George Kaplan|title=Relativistic Celestial Mechanics of the Solar System|date=25 October 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-3-527-63457-6}}</ref>{{rp|177}} \n\nLaplace's estimate for the velocity of gravity is not correct in a field theory which respects the principle of relativity. Since electric and magnetic fields combine, the attraction of a point charge which is moving at a constant velocity is towards the extrapolated instantaneous position, not to the apparent position it seems to occupy when looked at.<ref group=note>''Feynman Lectures on Physics vol. II'' gives a thorough treatment of the analogous problem in electromagnetism. Feynman shows that for a moving charge, the non-radiative field is an attraction/repulsion not toward the apparent position of the particle, but toward the extrapolated position assuming that the particle continues in a straight line in a constant velocity. This is a notable property of the [[Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential]]s which are used in the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]. Presumably the same holds in linearized gravity: e.g., see [[Gravitoelectromagnetism]].</ref> To avoid those problems, between 1870 and 1900 many scientists used the electrodynamic laws of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] to produce stable orbits and to explain the perihelion shift of Mercury's orbit. In 1890 L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the [[speed of light]] in his theory. And in another attempt [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypotheses were rejected.<ref>Roseveare 1982</ref> Another attempt by [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1900), who already used Maxwell's theory, produced a perihelion shift which was too low.<ref name=\"pais_1982\" />\n\n===Einstein's theory of general relativity===\n\n{{See also|Introduction to general relativity|General relativity}}\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s 1919 measurements of the bending of [[star]]-light by the [[Sun]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]] led to the acceptance of [[general relativity]] worldwide.]]\n\nAround 1904\u20131905, the works of [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and finally [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]], exclude the possibility of propagation of any effects faster than the [[speed of light]]. It followed that Newton's law of gravitation would have to be replaced with another law, compatible with the principle of relativity, while still obtaining the newtonian limit for circumstances where relativistic effects are negligible. Such attempts were made by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1907) and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910).<ref>Walter 2007</ref> In 1907 Einstein came to the conclusion that to achieve this a successor to special relativity was needed.  From 1907 to 1915, Einstein worked towards a new theory, using his [[equivalence principle]] as a key concept to guide his way.  According to this principle, a uniform gravitational field acts equally on everything within it and, therefore, cannot be detected by a free-falling observer.  Conversely, all local gravitational effects should be reproducible in a linearly accelerating reference frame, and vice versa.  Thus, gravity acts like a [[fictitious force]] such as the [[centrifugal force]] or the [[Coriolis force]], which result from being in an accelerated reference frame; all fictitious forces are proportional to the [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], just as gravity is. To effect the reconciliation of gravity and [[special relativity]] and to incorporate the equivalence principle, something had to be sacrificed; that something was the long-held classical assumption that our space obeys the laws of [[Euclidean geometry]], e.g., that the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is true experimentally. Einstein used a more general geometry, [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian geometry]], to allow for the curvature of space and time that was necessary for the reconciliation; after eight years of work (1907\u20131915), he succeeded in discovering the precise way in which [[space-time]] should be curved in order to reproduce the physical laws observed in Nature, particularly gravitation. Gravity is distinct from the fictitious forces centrifugal force and coriolis force in the sense that the curvature of spacetime is regarded as physically real, whereas the fictitious forces are not regarded as forces.  The very first solutions of [[Einstein field equations|his field equations]] explained the anomalous precession of Mercury and predicted an unusual bending of light, which was confirmed ''after'' his theory was published.  These solutions are explained below.\n\n==General relativity, special relativity and geometry==\n\nIn the normal [[Euclidean geometry]], triangles obey the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which states that the square distance ''ds''<sup>2</sup> between two points in space is the sum of the squares of its perpendicular components\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhere ''dx'', ''dy'' and ''dz'' represent the infinitesimal differences between the ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates of two points in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (add Figure here).  Now imagine a world in which this is not quite true; a world where the distance is instead given by\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = F(x, y, z) dx^{2} + G(x, y, z) dy^{2} + H(x, y, z)dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhere ''F'', ''G'' and ''H'' are arbitrary functions of position.  It is not hard to imagine such a world; we live on one.  The surface of the earth is curved, which is why it's impossible to make a perfectly accurate flat map of the earth.  Non-Cartesian coordinate systems illustrate this well; for example, in the spherical coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6''), the Euclidean distance can be written\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\theta^{2} + r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta d\\varphi^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nAnother illustration would be a world in which the rulers used to measure length were untrustworthy, rulers that changed their length with their position and even their orientation.  In the most general case, one must allow for cross-terms when calculating the distance ''ds''\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = g_{xx} dx^{2} + g_{xy} dx dy + g_{xz} dx dz + \\cdots + g_{zy} dz dy + g_{zz} dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhere the nine functions ''g''<sub>xx</sub>, ''g''<sub>xy</sub>, &hellip;, ''g''<sub>zz</sub> constitute the [[metric tensor]], which defines the geometry of the space in [[Riemannian geometry]].  In the spherical-coordinates example above, there are no cross-terms; the only nonzero metric tensor components are ''g''<sub>rr</sub> = 1, ''g''<sub>\u03b8\u03b8</sub> = ''r''<sup>2</sup> and ''g''<sub>\u03c6\u03c6</sub> = ''r''<sup>2</sup> sin<sup>2</sup> \u03b8.\n\nIn his [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] showed that the distance ''ds'' between two  spatial points is not constant, but depends on the motion of the observer.  However, there is a measure of separation between two points in [[space-time]] \u2014 called \"proper time\" and denoted with the symbol d\u03c4 \u2014  that ''is'' invariant; in other words, it doesn't depend on the motion of the observer.\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} d\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhich may be written in spherical coordinates as\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} d\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - dr^{2} - r^{2} d\\theta^{2} - r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta d\\varphi^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nThis formula is the natural extension of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and similarly holds only when there is no curvature in space-time.  In [[general relativity]], however, space and time may have curvature, so this distance formula must be modified to a more general form\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} d\\tau^{2} = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^{\\mu} dx^{\\nu} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\njust as we generalized the formula to measure distance on the surface of the Earth.  The exact form of the metric ''g''<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub> depends on the gravitating mass, momentum and energy, as described by the [[Einstein field equations]].  Einstein developed those field equations to match the then known laws of Nature; however, they predicted never-before-seen phenomena (such as the bending of light by gravity) that were confirmed later.\n\n===Geodesic equation===\n\n{{See also|Schwarzschild geodesics|Geodesic|Christoffel symbols}}\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, particles of negligible mass travel along [[geodesic]]s in the space-time.  In uncurved space-time, far from a source of gravity, these geodesics correspond to straight lines; however, they may deviate from straight lines when the space-time is curved.  The equation for the geodesic lines is<ref>Weinberg 1972.</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d^2x^{\\mu}}{d q^2} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\nu\\lambda} \\frac{dx^{\\nu}}{d q} \\frac{dx^{\\lambda}}{dq} = 0\n</math>\n\nwhere \u0393 represents the [[Christoffel symbol]] and the variable ''q'' parametrizes the particle's path through [[space-time]], its so-called [[world line]].  The Christoffel symbol depends only on the [[metric tensor]] ''g''<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>, or rather on how it changes with position.   The variable ''q'' is a constant multiple of the [[proper time]] ''\u03c4'' for timelike orbits (which are traveled by massive particles), and is usually taken to be equal to it.  For lightlike (or null) orbits (which are traveled by massless particles such as the [[photon]]), the proper time is zero and, strictly speaking, cannot be used as the variable ''q''.   Nevertheless, lightlike orbits can be derived as the [[ultrarelativistic limit]] of timelike orbits, that is, the limit as the particle mass ''m'' goes to zero while holding its total [[energy]] fixed.\n\n==Schwarzschild solution==\n\n{{main article|Schwarzschild geodesics}}\n\nAn exact solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which corresponds to the external gravitational field of a stationary, uncharged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass ''M''.  It is characterized by a length scale ''r''<sub>s</sub>, known as the [[Schwarzschild radius]], which is defined by the formula\n\n::<math>\nr_{s} = \\frac{2GM}{c^{2}}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity is recovered in the limit as the ratio ''r''<sub>s</sub>/''r''  goes to zero.  In that limit, the metric returns to that defined by [[special relativity]].\n\nIn practice, this ratio is almost always extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius ''r''<sub>s</sub> of the Earth is roughly 9&nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]] ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;[[inch]]); at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion.  The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is much larger, roughly 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio ''r''<sub>s</sub>/''r'' is roughly 4 parts in a million.  A [[white dwarf]] star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface is roughly 250 parts in a million.  The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as [[neutron star]]s (where the ratio is roughly 50%) and [[black hole]]s.\n\n===Orbits about the central mass===\n\n[[File:Newton.vs.Schwarzschild.thumbnail.250px.png|thumb|right|250px|link=File:Newton_versus_Schwarzschild_trajectories.gif|Comparison between the orbit of a test particle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime.

This can be converted into an equation for the orbit\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{r^{4}}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{s}}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{r^{4}}{a^{2}} + r^{2} \\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere, for brevity, two length-scales, ''a'' = ''h/c'' and  ''b'' = ''Lc/E'', have been introduced.  They are constants of the motion and depend on the initial conditions (position and velocity) of the test particle.  Hence, the solution of the orbit equation is\n\n:<math>\n\\varphi = \\int \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[\\frac{1}{b^2} - \\left(1 - \\frac{r_\\mathrm{s}}{r}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}} dr.\n</math>\n\n===Effective radial potential energy===\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle derived above\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \n\\frac{E^2}{m^2 c^2} - c^{2} + \\frac{ r_{s} c^2}{r} - \n\\frac{h^2}{ r^2 } + \\frac{ r_{s} h^2 }{ r^3 }\n</math>\n\ncan be rewritten using the definition of the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild radius]] ''r''<sub>s</sub> as\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \n\\left[ \\frac{E^2}{2 m c^2} - \\frac{1}{2} m c^2 \\right]\n+ \\frac{GMm}{r} - \\frac{ L^2 }{ 2 \\mu r^2 } + \\frac{ G(M+m) L^2 }{c^2 \\mu r^3}\n</math>\n\nwhich is equivalent to a particle moving in a one-dimensional [[effective potential]]\n\n:<math>\nV(r) = -\\frac{GMm}{r} + \\frac{ L^2 }{ 2 \\mu r^2 } - \\frac{ G(M+m) L^2 }{ c^2 \\mu r^3 }\n</math>\n\nThe first two terms are well-known classical energies, the first being the attractive Newtonian gravitational potential energy and the second corresponding to the repulsive [[Centrifugal force|\"centrifugal\" potential energy]]; however, the third term is an attractive energy unique to [[general relativity]].  As shown below and [[Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector#Evolution under perturbed potentials|elsewhere]], this inverse-cubic energy causes elliptical orbits to precess gradually by an angle \u03b4\u03c6 per revolution\n\n:<math>\n\\delta \\varphi \\approx \\frac{ 6\\pi G(M+m) }{ c^2  A \\left( 1 - e^{2} \\right)}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. Here ''\u03b4\u03c6'' is ''not'' the change in the ''\u03c6''-coordinate in (''t'', ''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6'') coordinates but the change in the [[argument of periapsis]] of the classical closed orbit.\n\nThe third term is attractive and dominates at small ''r'' values, giving a critical inner radius ''r''<sub>inner</sub> at which a particle is drawn inexorably inwards to ''r'' = 0; this inner radius is a function of the particle's angular momentum per unit mass or, equivalently, the ''a'' length-scale defined above.\n\n===Circular orbits and their stability===\n\n[[File:Schwarzschild effective potential.svg|thumb|350px|right|Effective radial potential for various angular momenta.

At higher angular momenta, there is a significant centrifugal barrier (orange curve) and an unstable inner radius, highlighted in red.]]\n\nThe effective potential ''V'' can be re-written in terms of the length ''a'' = ''h''/''c'':\n\n:<math>\nV(r) = \\frac{mc^{2}}{2} \\left[ - \\frac{r_{s}}{r} + \\frac{a^{2}}{r^{2}} - \\frac{r_{s} a^{2}}{r^{3}} \\right].\n</math>\n\nCircular orbits are possible when the effective force is zero:\n\n:<math>\nF = -\\frac{dV}{dr} = -\\frac{mc^{2}}{2r^{4}} \\left[ r_{s} r^{2} - 2a^{2} r + 3r_{s} a^{2} \\right] = 0;\n</math>\n\ni.e., when the two attractive forces\u2014Newtonian gravity (first term) and the attraction unique to general relativity (third term)\u2014are exactly balanced by the repulsive centrifugal force (second term).  There are two radii at which this balancing can occur, denoted here as ''r''<sub>inner</sub> and ''r''<sub>outer</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  r_{\\mathrm{outer}} &= \\frac{a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \\right) \\\\\n  r_{\\mathrm{inner}} &= \\frac{a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \\right) = \\frac{3a^{2}}{r_{\\mathrm{outer}}},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich are obtained using the [[Quadratic equation#Quadratic formula and its derivation|quadratic formula]].  The inner radius ''r''<sub>inner</sub> is unstable, because the attractive third force strengthens much faster than the other two forces when ''r'' becomes small; if the particle slips slightly inwards from ''r''<sub>inner</sub> (where all three forces are in balance), the third force dominates the other two and draws the particle inexorably inwards to ''r''&nbsp;= 0.  At the outer radius, however, the circular orbits are stable; the third term is less important and the system behaves more like the non-relativistic [[Kepler problem]].\n\nWhen ''a'' is much greater than ''r''<sub>s</sub> (the classical case), these formulae become approximately\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  r_{\\mathrm{outer}} &\\approx \\frac{2a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\\\\n  r_{\\mathrm{inner}} &\\approx \\frac{3}{2} r_{s}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n[[File:Schwarzschild circular radii.svg|thumb|left|320px|The stable and unstable radii are plotted versus the normalized angular momentum ''a''/''r''<sub>s</sub> = ''L''/''mcr''<sub>s</sub> in blue and red, respectively.

Circular orbits smaller than {{frac|3|2}}&nbsp;''r''<sub>s</sub> are not possible.

However, it is inadequate for [[binary star]]s, in which the masses may be of similar magnitude.\n\nThe metric for the case of two comparable masses cannot be solved in closed form and therefore one has to resort to approximation techniques such as the [[post-Newtonian approximation]] or numerical approximations. In passing, we mention one particular exception in lower dimensions (see [[R=T model]] for details).

The method is iterative; an initial solution for particle motions is used to calculate the gravitational fields; from these derived fields, new particle motions can be calculated, from which even more accurate estimates of the fields can be computed, and so on.  This approach is called \"post-Newtonian\" because the Newtonian solution for the particle orbits is often used as the initial solution.\n\nWhen this method is applied to the two-body problem without restriction on their masses, the result is remarkably simple.  To the lowest order, the relative motion of the two particles is equivalent to the motion of an infinitesimal particle in the field of their combined masses.  In other words, the Schwarzschild solution can be applied, provided that the ''M'' + ''m'' is used in place of ''M'' in the formulae for the Schwarzschild radius ''r''<sub>''s''</sub> and the precession angle per revolution \u03b4\u03c6.\n\n===Modern computational approaches===\n\n{{See also|Numerical relativity}}\n\nEinstein's equations can also be solved on a computer using sophisticated numerical methods.<ref name=\"Pretorius2005\"/><ref name=\"CampanelliLousto2006\"/><ref name=\"BakerCentrella2006\"/>  Given sufficient computer power, such solutions can be more accurate than post-Newtonian solutions.

Solving the [[Kepler problem]] is essential to calculate the bending of light by gravity and the motion of a [[planet]] orbiting its sun.  Solutions are also used to describe the motion of [[binary star]]s around each other, and estimate their gradual loss of energy through [[gravitational radiation]]. It is customary to assume that both bodies are point-like, so that [[tidal force]]s and the specifics of their material composition can be neglected.\n\nGeneral relativity describes the gravitational field by curved space-time; the [[Einstein equation|field equations governing this curvature]] are [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] and therefore difficult to solve in a [[closed-form expression|closed form]].  No exact solutions of the Kepler problem have been found, but an approximate solution has: the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]].  This solution pertains when the mass ''M'' of one body is overwhelmingly greater than the mass ''m'' of the other.  If so, the larger mass may be taken as stationary and the sole contributor to the gravitational field.  This is a good approximation for a photon passing a star and for a planet orbiting its sun.   The motion of the lighter body (called the \"particle\" below) can then be determined from the Schwarzschild solution; the motion is a  [[geodesic]] (\"shortest path between two points\") in the curved space-time.  Such geodesic solutions account for the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous precession]] of the [[Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury]], which is a key piece of evidence supporting the theory of general relativity.  They also describe the bending of light in a gravitational field, another prediction [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|famously used as evidence]] for general relativity.\n\nIf both masses are considered to contribute to the gravitational field, as in binary stars, the Kepler problem can be solved only approximately.  The earliest approximation method to be developed was the [[post-Newtonian expansion]], an iterative method in which an initial solution is gradually corrected.

The ends of the diameter indicate the [[apsis|apsides]], the points of closest and farthest distance. ]]\n\nThe Kepler problem derives its name from [[Johannes Kepler]], who worked as an assistant to the Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]].  Brahe took extraordinarily accurate measurements of the motion of the planets of the Solar System.  From these measurements, Kepler was able to formulate [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]], the first modern description of planetary motion:\n#The [[orbit]] of every [[planet]] is an [[ellipse]] with the Sun at one of the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]].\n#A [[line (geometry)|line]] joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal [[area]]s during equal intervals of time.\n#The [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[orbital period]] of a planet is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit.\nKepler published the first two laws in 1609 and the third law in 1619.  They supplanted earlier models of the Solar System, such as those of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]].  Kepler's laws apply only in the limited case of the two-body problem.  [[Voltaire]] and [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] were the first to call them \"Kepler's laws\".\n\nNearly a century later, [[Isaac Newton]] had formulated his [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]].  In particular, Newton's second law states that a force ''F'' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration ''a'' given by the equation ''F''=''ma''.  Newton then posed the question: what must the force be that produces the elliptical orbits seen by Kepler?  His answer came in his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], which states that the force between a mass ''M'' and another mass ''m'' is given by the formula\n\n:<math>\nF = G \\frac{M m}{r^2}\n</math>,\n\nwhere ''r'' is the distance between the masses and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].  Given this force law and his equations of motion, Newton was able to show that two point masses attracting each other would each follow perfectly elliptical orbits.  The ratio of sizes of these ellipses is ''m''/''M'', with the larger mass moving on a smaller ellipse.  If ''M'' is much larger than ''m'', then the larger mass will appear to be stationary at the focus of the elliptical orbit of the lighter mass ''m''.  This model can be applied approximately to the Solar System.  Since the mass of the Sun is much larger than those of the planets, the force acting on each planet is principally due to the Sun; the gravity of the planets for each other can be neglected to first approximation.\n\n===Apsidal precession===\n\n{{See also|Apsidal precession|Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector}}\n\n[[File:Precessing Kepler orbit 280frames e0.6 smaller.gif|thumb|right|345px|In the absence of any other forces, a particle orbiting another under the influence of Newtonian gravity follows the same perfect [[ellipse]] eternally.  The presence of other forces (such as the gravitation of other planets), causes this ellipse to rotate gradually.  The rate of this rotation (called orbital precession) can be measured very accurately.  The rate can also be predicted knowing the magnitudes and directions of the other forces.  However, the predictions of Newtonian gravity do not match the observations, as discovered in 1859 from observations of Mercury.]]\n\nIf the potential energy between the two bodies is not exactly the 1/''r'' potential of Newton's gravitational law but differs only slightly, then the ellipse of the orbit gradually rotates (among other possible effects).  This [[apsidal precession]] is observed for all the planets orbiting the Sun, primarily due to the oblateness of the Sun (it is not perfectly spherical) and the attractions of the other planets to one another.  The apsides are the two points of closest and furthest distance of the orbit (the periapsis and apoapsis, respectively); apsidal precession corresponds to the rotation of the line joining the apsides. It also corresponds to the rotation of the [[Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector]], which points along the line of apsides.\n\nNewton's law of gravitation soon became accepted because it gave very accurate predictions of the motion of all the planets.{{dubious|reason=Mercury's value would have been off by ~10% due to general relativity; the total precessions of other planets are smaller than the error in Mercury's value, so could not have been measured to be non-zero at all if accuracy was so low not to notice Mercury's anomlay|date=January 2013}}  These calculations were carried out initially by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the late 18th century, and refined by [[F\u00e9lix Tisserand]] in the later 19th century.  Conversely, if Newton's law of gravitation did ''not'' predict the apsidal precessions of the planets accurately, it would have to be discarded as a theory of gravitation.  Such an anomalous precession was observed in the second half of the 19th century.\n\n===Anomalous precession of Mercury===\n{{See also|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nIn 1859, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] discovered that the orbital [[precession]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was not quite what it should be; the ellipse of its orbit was rotating (precessing) slightly faster than predicted by the traditional theory of Newtonian gravity, even after all the effects of the other planets had been accounted for.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Le Verrier | first = UJJ | authorlink = Urbain Le Verrier | year = 1859 | title = Unknown title | journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]] | volume = 49 | pages = 379&ndash;?}}</ref>  The effect is small (roughly 43 [[arcsecond]]s of rotation per century), but well above the measurement error (roughly 0.1 [[arcsecond]]s per century).  Le Verrier realized the importance of his discovery immediately, and challenged astronomers and physicists alike to account for it.  Several classical explanations were proposed, such as interplanetary dust, unobserved oblateness of the [[Sun]], an undetected moon of Mercury, or a new planet named [[Vulcan (planet)|Vulcan]].<ref name=\"pais_1982\"/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}  After these explanations were discounted, some physicists were driven to the more radical hypothesis that [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[inverse-square law]] of gravitation was incorrect.  For example, some physicists proposed a [[power law]] with an [[exponent]] that was slightly different from 2.<ref name=\"pais_1982\"/>{{rp|254}}\n\nOthers argued that Newton's law should be supplemented with a velocity-dependent potential. However, this implied a conflict with Newtonian celestial dynamics. In his treatise on celestial mechanics, [[Laplace]] had shown that if the gravitational influence does not act instantaneously, then the motions of the planets themselves will not exactly conserve momentum (and consequently some of the momentum  would have to be ascribed to the mediator of the gravitational interaction, analogous to ascribing momentum to the mediator of the electromagnetic interaction.) As seen from a Newtonian point of view, if gravitational influence does propagate at a finite speed, then at all points in time a planet is attracted to a point where the Sun was some time before, and not towards the instantaneous position of the Sun. On the assumption of the classical fundamentals, Laplace had shown that if gravity would propagate at a velocity on the order of the speed of light then the solar system would be unstable, and would not exist for a long time. The observation that the solar system is old enough allowed him to put a lower limit on the [[speed of gravity]] that turned out to be many orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light.<ref name=\"pais_1982\">Pais 1982</ref><ref name=\"KopeikinEfroimsky2011\">{{cite book|author1=Sergei Kopeikin|author2=Michael Efroimsky|author3=George Kaplan|title=Relativistic Celestial Mechanics of the Solar System|date=25 October 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-3-527-63457-6}}</ref>{{rp|177}} \n\nLaplace's estimate for the velocity of gravity is not correct in a field theory which respects the principle of relativity. Since electric and magnetic fields combine, the attraction of a point charge which is moving at a constant velocity is towards the extrapolated instantaneous position, not to the apparent position it seems to occupy when looked at.<ref group=note>''Feynman Lectures on Physics vol. II'' gives a thorough treatment of the analogous problem in electromagnetism. Feynman shows that for a moving charge, the non-radiative field is an attraction/repulsion not toward the apparent position of the particle, but toward the extrapolated position assuming that the particle continues in a straight line in a constant velocity. This is a notable property of the [[Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential]]s which are used in the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]. Presumably the same holds in linearized gravity: e.g., see [[Gravitoelectromagnetism]].</ref> To avoid those problems, between 1870 and 1900 many scientists used the electrodynamic laws of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] to produce stable orbits and to explain the perihelion shift of Mercury's orbit. In 1890 L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the [[speed of light]] in his theory. And in another attempt [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypotheses were rejected.<ref>Roseveare 1982</ref> Another attempt by [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1900), who already used Maxwell's theory, produced a perihelion shift which was too low.<ref name=\"pais_1982\" />\n\n===Einstein's theory of general relativity===\n\n{{See also|Introduction to general relativity|General relativity}}\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s 1919 measurements of the bending of [[star]]-light by the [[Sun]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]] led to the acceptance of [[general relativity]] worldwide.]]\n\nAround 1904\u20131905, the works of [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and finally [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]], exclude the possibility of propagation of any effects faster than the [[speed of light]]. It followed that Newton's law of gravitation would have to be replaced with another law, compatible with the principle of relativity, while still obtaining the newtonian limit for circumstances where relativistic effects are negligible. Such attempts were made by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1907) and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910).<ref>Walter 2007</ref> In 1907 Einstein came to the conclusion that to achieve this a successor to special relativity was needed.  From 1907 to 1915, Einstein worked towards a new theory, using his [[equivalence principle]] as a key concept to guide his way.  According to this principle, a uniform gravitational field acts equally on everything within it and, therefore, cannot be detected by a free-falling observer.  Conversely, all local gravitational effects should be reproducible in a linearly accelerating reference frame, and vice versa.  Thus, gravity acts like a [[fictitious force]] such as the [[centrifugal force]] or the [[Coriolis force]], which result from being in an accelerated reference frame; all fictitious forces are proportional to the [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], just as gravity is. To effect the reconciliation of gravity and [[special relativity]] and to incorporate the equivalence principle, something had to be sacrificed; that something was the long-held classical assumption that our space obeys the laws of [[Euclidean geometry]], e.g., that the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is true experimentally. Einstein used a more general geometry, [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian geometry]], to allow for the curvature of space and time that was necessary for the reconciliation; after eight years of work (1907\u20131915), he succeeded in discovering the precise way in which [[space-time]] should be curved in order to reproduce the physical laws observed in Nature, particularly gravitation. Gravity is distinct from the fictitious forces centrifugal force and coriolis force in the sense that the curvature of spacetime is regarded as physically real, whereas the fictitious forces are not regarded as forces.  The very first solutions of [[Einstein field equations|his field equations]] explained the anomalous precession of Mercury and predicted an unusual bending of light, which was confirmed ''after'' his theory was published.  These solutions are explained below.\n\n==General relativity, special relativity and geometry==\n\nIn the normal [[Euclidean geometry]], triangles obey the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which states that the square distance ''ds''<sup>2</sup> between two points in space is the sum of the squares of its perpendicular components\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhere ''dx'', ''dy'' and ''dz'' represent the infinitesimal differences between the ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates of two points in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (add Figure here).  Now imagine a world in which this is not quite true; a world where the distance is instead given by\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = F(x, y, z) dx^{2} + G(x, y, z) dy^{2} + H(x, y, z)dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhere ''F'', ''G'' and ''H'' are arbitrary functions of position.  It is not hard to imagine such a world; we live on one.  The surface of the earth is curved, which is why it's impossible to make a perfectly accurate flat map of the earth.  Non-Cartesian coordinate systems illustrate this well; for example, in the spherical coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6''), the Euclidean distance can be written\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\theta^{2} + r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta d\\varphi^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nAnother illustration would be a world in which the rulers used to measure length were untrustworthy, rulers that changed their length with their position and even their orientation.  In the most general case, one must allow for cross-terms when calculating the distance ''ds''\n\n:<math>\nds^{2} = g_{xx} dx^{2} + g_{xy} dx dy + g_{xz} dx dz + \\cdots + g_{zy} dz dy + g_{zz} dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhere the nine functions ''g''<sub>xx</sub>, ''g''<sub>xy</sub>, &hellip;, ''g''<sub>zz</sub> constitute the [[metric tensor]], which defines the geometry of the space in [[Riemannian geometry]].  In the spherical-coordinates example above, there are no cross-terms; the only nonzero metric tensor components are ''g''<sub>rr</sub> = 1, ''g''<sub>\u03b8\u03b8</sub> = ''r''<sup>2</sup> and ''g''<sub>\u03c6\u03c6</sub> = ''r''<sup>2</sup> sin<sup>2</sup> \u03b8.\n\nIn his [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] showed that the distance ''ds'' between two  spatial points is not constant, but depends on the motion of the observer.  However, there is a measure of separation between two points in [[space-time]] \u2014 called \"proper time\" and denoted with the symbol d\u03c4 \u2014  that ''is'' invariant; in other words, it doesn't depend on the motion of the observer.\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} d\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nwhich may be written in spherical coordinates as\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} d\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - dr^{2} - r^{2} d\\theta^{2} - r^{2} \\sin^{2} \\theta d\\varphi^{2} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\nThis formula is the natural extension of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and similarly holds only when there is no curvature in space-time.  In [[general relativity]], however, space and time may have curvature, so this distance formula must be modified to a more general form\n\n:<math>\nc^{2} d\\tau^{2} = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^{\\mu} dx^{\\nu} \\,\\!\n</math>\n\njust as we generalized the formula to measure distance on the surface of the Earth.  The exact form of the metric ''g''<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub> depends on the gravitating mass, momentum and energy, as described by the [[Einstein field equations]].  Einstein developed those field equations to match the then known laws of Nature; however, they predicted never-before-seen phenomena (such as the bending of light by gravity) that were confirmed later.\n\n===Geodesic equation===\n\n{{See also|Schwarzschild geodesics|Geodesic|Christoffel symbols}}\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, particles of negligible mass travel along [[geodesic]]s in the space-time.  In uncurved space-time, far from a source of gravity, these geodesics correspond to straight lines; however, they may deviate from straight lines when the space-time is curved.  The equation for the geodesic lines is<ref>Weinberg 1972.</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d^2x^{\\mu}}{d q^2} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\nu\\lambda} \\frac{dx^{\\nu}}{d q} \\frac{dx^{\\lambda}}{dq} = 0\n</math>\n\nwhere \u0393 represents the [[Christoffel symbol]] and the variable ''q'' parametrizes the particle's path through [[space-time]], its so-called [[world line]].  The Christoffel symbol depends only on the [[metric tensor]] ''g''<sub>\u03bc\u03bd</sub>, or rather on how it changes with position.   The variable ''q'' is a constant multiple of the [[proper time]] ''\u03c4'' for timelike orbits (which are traveled by massive particles), and is usually taken to be equal to it.  For lightlike (or null) orbits (which are traveled by massless particles such as the [[photon]]), the proper time is zero and, strictly speaking, cannot be used as the variable ''q''.   Nevertheless, lightlike orbits can be derived as the [[ultrarelativistic limit]] of timelike orbits, that is, the limit as the particle mass ''m'' goes to zero while holding its total [[energy]] fixed.\n\n==Schwarzschild solution==\n\n{{main article|Schwarzschild geodesics}}\n\nAn exact solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which corresponds to the external gravitational field of a stationary, uncharged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass ''M''.  It is characterized by a length scale ''r''<sub>s</sub>, known as the [[Schwarzschild radius]], which is defined by the formula\n\n::<math>\nr_{s} = \\frac{2GM}{c^{2}}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity is recovered in the limit as the ratio ''r''<sub>s</sub>/''r''  goes to zero.  In that limit, the metric returns to that defined by [[special relativity]].\n\nIn practice, this ratio is almost always extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius ''r''<sub>s</sub> of the Earth is roughly 9&nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]] ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;[[inch]]); at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion.  The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is much larger, roughly 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio ''r''<sub>s</sub>/''r'' is roughly 4 parts in a million.  A [[white dwarf]] star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface is roughly 250 parts in a million.  The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as [[neutron star]]s (where the ratio is roughly 50%) and [[black hole]]s.\n\n===Orbits about the central mass===\n\n[[File:Newton.vs.Schwarzschild.thumbnail.250px.png|thumb|right|250px|link=File:Newton_versus_Schwarzschild_trajectories.gif|Comparison between the orbit of a testparticle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime. Please click for high resolution animated graphics.]]\nThe orbits of a test particle of infinitesimal mass ''m'' about the central mass ''M'' is given by the equation of motion\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{E^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{s}}{r} \\right) \\left( c^{2} + \\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} \\right).\n</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is the [[specific relative angular momentum]], <math>h = r \\times v = { L \\over \\mu }</math> and <math>\\mu</math> is the reduced mass. This can be converted into an equation for the orbit\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\varphi} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{r^{4}}{b^{2}} - \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_{s}}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{r^{4}}{a^{2}} + r^{2} \\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere, for brevity, two length-scales, ''a'' = ''h/c'' and  ''b'' = ''Lc/E'', have been introduced.  They are constants of the motion and depend on the initial conditions (position and velocity) of the test particle.  Hence, the solution of the orbit equation is\n\n:<math>\n\\varphi = \\int \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[\\frac{1}{b^2} - \\left(1 - \\frac{r_\\mathrm{s}}{r}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}} dr.\n</math>\n\n===Effective radial potential energy===\n\nThe equation of motion for the particle derived above\n\n:<math>\n\\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \n\\frac{E^2}{m^2 c^2} - c^{2} + \\frac{ r_{s} c^2}{r} - \n\\frac{h^2}{ r^2 } + \\frac{ r_{s} h^2 }{ r^3 }\n</math>\n\ncan be rewritten using the definition of the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild radius]] ''r''<sub>s</sub> as\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\left( \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} \\right)^{2} = \n\\left[ \\frac{E^2}{2 m c^2} - \\frac{1}{2} m c^2 \\right]\n+ \\frac{GMm}{r} - \\frac{ L^2 }{ 2 \\mu r^2 } + \\frac{ G(M+m) L^2 }{c^2 \\mu r^3}\n</math>\n\nwhich is equivalent to a particle moving in a one-dimensional [[effective potential]]\n\n:<math>\nV(r) = -\\frac{GMm}{r} + \\frac{ L^2 }{ 2 \\mu r^2 } - \\frac{ G(M+m) L^2 }{ c^2 \\mu r^3 }\n</math>\n\nThe first two terms are well-known classical energies, the first being the attractive Newtonian gravitational potential energy and the second corresponding to the repulsive [[Centrifugal force|\"centrifugal\" potential energy]]; however, the third term is an attractive energy unique to [[general relativity]].  As shown below and [[Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector#Evolution under perturbed potentials|elsewhere]], this inverse-cubic energy causes elliptical orbits to precess gradually by an angle \u03b4\u03c6 per revolution\n\n:<math>\n\\delta \\varphi \\approx \\frac{ 6\\pi G(M+m) }{ c^2  A \\left( 1 - e^{2} \\right)}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. Here ''\u03b4\u03c6'' is ''not'' the change in the ''\u03c6''-coordinate in (''t'', ''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6'') coordinates but the change in the [[argument of periapsis]] of the classical closed orbit.\n\nThe third term is attractive and dominates at small ''r'' values, giving a critical inner radius ''r''<sub>inner</sub> at which a particle is drawn inexorably inwards to ''r'' = 0; this inner radius is a function of the particle's angular momentum per unit mass or, equivalently, the ''a'' length-scale defined above.\n\n===Circular orbits and their stability===\n\n[[File:Schwarzschild effective potential.svg|thumb|350px|right|Effective radial potential for various angular momenta. At small radii, the energy drops precipitously, causing the particle to be pulled inexorably inwards to ''r'' = 0. However, when the normalized angular momentum ''a''/''r''<sub>s</sub> = ''L''/''mcr''<sub>s</sub> equals the square root of three, a metastable circular orbit is possible at the radius highlighted with a green circle.  At higher angular momenta, there is a significant centrifugal barrier (orange curve) and an unstable inner radius, highlighted in red.]]\n\nThe effective potential ''V'' can be re-written in terms of the length ''a'' = ''h''/''c'':\n\n:<math>\nV(r) = \\frac{mc^{2}}{2} \\left[ - \\frac{r_{s}}{r} + \\frac{a^{2}}{r^{2}} - \\frac{r_{s} a^{2}}{r^{3}} \\right].\n</math>\n\nCircular orbits are possible when the effective force is zero:\n\n:<math>\nF = -\\frac{dV}{dr} = -\\frac{mc^{2}}{2r^{4}} \\left[ r_{s} r^{2} - 2a^{2} r + 3r_{s} a^{2} \\right] = 0;\n</math>\n\ni.e., when the two attractive forces\u2014Newtonian gravity (first term) and the attraction unique to general relativity (third term)\u2014are exactly balanced by the repulsive centrifugal force (second term).  There are two radii at which this balancing can occur, denoted here as ''r''<sub>inner</sub> and ''r''<sub>outer</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  r_{\\mathrm{outer}} &= \\frac{a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \\right) \\\\\n  r_{\\mathrm{inner}} &= \\frac{a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \\right) = \\frac{3a^{2}}{r_{\\mathrm{outer}}},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich are obtained using the [[Quadratic equation#Quadratic formula and its derivation|quadratic formula]].  The inner radius ''r''<sub>inner</sub> is unstable, because the attractive third force strengthens much faster than the other two forces when ''r'' becomes small; if the particle slips slightly inwards from ''r''<sub>inner</sub> (where all three forces are in balance), the third force dominates the other two and draws the particle inexorably inwards to ''r''&nbsp;= 0.  At the outer radius, however, the circular orbits are stable; the third term is less important and the system behaves more like the non-relativistic [[Kepler problem]].\n\nWhen ''a'' is much greater than ''r''<sub>s</sub> (the classical case), these formulae become approximately\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  r_{\\mathrm{outer}} &\\approx \\frac{2a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\\\\n  r_{\\mathrm{inner}} &\\approx \\frac{3}{2} r_{s}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n[[File:Schwarzschild circular radii.svg|thumb|left|320px|The stable and unstable radii are plotted versus the normalized angular momentum ''a''/''r''<sub>s</sub> = ''L''/''mcr''<sub>s</sub> in blue and red, respectively.

For comparison, the classical radius predicted from the [[centripetal acceleration]] and Newton's law of gravity is plotted in black.]]\n\nSubstituting the definitions of ''a'' and ''r''<sub>s</sub> into ''r''<sub>outer</sub> yields the classical formula for a particle of mass ''m'' orbiting a body of mass ''M''.\n\nThe following equation\n\n:<math>\nr_{\\mathrm{outer}}^{3} = \\frac{G(M+m)}{\\omega_{\\varphi}^{2}}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c9''<sub>\u03c6</sub> is the orbital angular speed of the particle, is obtained in non-relativistic mechanics by setting the [[centrifugal force]] equal to the Newtonian gravitational force:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{GMm}{r^{2}} = \\mu \\omega_{\\varphi}^{2} r\n</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[reduced mass]].\n\nIn our notation, the classical orbital angular speed equals\n\n:<math>\n\\omega_{\\varphi}^{2} \\approx \\frac{GM}{r_{\\mathrm{outer}}^{3}} = \\left( \\frac{r_{s} c^{2}}{2r_{\\mathrm{outer}}^{3}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{r_{s} c^{2}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{r_{s}^{3}}{8a^{6}}\\right) = \\frac{c^{2} r_{s}^{4}}{16 a^{6}}\n</math>\n\nAt the other extreme, when ''a''<sup>2</sup> approaches 3''r''<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> from above, the two radii converge to a single value\n\n:<math>\nr_{\\mathrm{outer}} \\approx r_{\\mathrm{inner}} \\approx 3 r_{s}\n</math>\n\nThe [[Quadratic equation#Quadratic formula and its derivation|quadratic solutions]] above ensure that ''r''<sub>outer</sub> is always greater than 3''r''<sub>s</sub>, whereas ''r''<sub>inner</sub> lies between {{frac|3|2}}&nbsp;''r''<sub>s</sub> and 3''r''<sub>s</sub>.  Circular orbits smaller than {{frac|3|2}}&nbsp;''r''<sub>s</sub> are not possible.  For massless particles, ''a'' goes to infinity, implying that there is a circular orbit for photons at ''r''<sub>inner</sub> = {{frac|3|2}}&nbsp;''r''<sub>s</sub>. The sphere of this radius is sometimes known as the [[photon sphere]].\n\n===Precession of elliptical orbits===\n[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|right|In the non-relativistic [[Kepler problem]], a particle follows the same perfect [[ellipse]] (red orbit) eternally.  [[General relativity]] introduces a third force that attracts the particle slightly more strongly than Newtonian gravity, especially at small radii.  This third force causes the particle's elliptical orbit to [[Apsidal precession|precess]] (cyan orbit) in the direction of its rotation; this effect has been measured in [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and Earth.  The yellow dot within the orbits represents the center of attraction, such as the [[Sun]].]]\n\nThe orbital precession rate may be derived using this radial effective potential ''V''.  A small radial deviation from a circular orbit of radius ''r''<sub>outer</sub> will oscillate in a stable manner with an angular frequency\n\n:<math>\n\\omega_{r}^{2} = \\frac{1}{m} \\left[ \\frac{d^{2}V}{dr^{2}} \\right]_{r=r_{\\mathrm{outer}}}\n</math>\n\nwhich equals\n\n:<math>\n\\omega_{r}^{2} = \\left( \\frac{c^{2} r_{s}}{2 r_{\\mathrm{outer}}^{4}} \\right) \\left( r_{\\mathrm{outer}} - r_{\\mathrm{inner}} \\right) = \n\\omega_{\\varphi}^{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \n</math>\n\nTaking the square root of both sides and expanding using the [[binomial theorem]] yields the formula\n\n:<math>\n\\omega_{r} = \\omega_{\\varphi} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{4a^{2}} + \\cdots \\right)\n</math>\n\nMultiplying by the period ''T'' of one revolution gives the precession of the orbit per revolution\n\n:<math>\n\\delta \\varphi = T \\left( \\omega_{\\varphi} - \\omega_{r} \\right) \\approx 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{4a^{2}} \\right) = \n\\frac{3\\pi m^{2} c^{2}}{2L^{2}} r_{s}^{2}\n</math>\n\nwhere we have used ''\u03c9<sub>\u03c6</sub>T'' = 2''\u043f'' and the definition of the length-scale ''a''.

This is a reasonable approximation for photons and the orbit of Mercury, which is roughly 6 million times lighter than the Sun.  However, it is inadequate for [[binary star]]s, in which the masses may be of similar magnitude.\n\nThe metric for the case of two comparable masses cannot be solved in closed form and therefore one has to resort to approximation techniques such as the [[post-Newtonian approximation]] or numerical approximations. In passing, we mention one particular exception in lower dimensions (see [[R=T model]] for details).  In (1+1) dimensions, i.e. a space made of one spatial dimension and one time dimension, the metric for two bodies of equal masses can be solved analytically in terms of the [[Lambert W function]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=T. |last=Ohta |first2=R.

The method is iterative; an initial solution for particle motions is used to calculate the gravitational fields; from these derived fields, new particle motions can be calculated, from which even more accurate estimates of the fields can be computed, and so on.  This approach is called \"post-Newtonian\" because the Newtonian solution for the particle orbits is often used as the initial solution.\n\nWhen this method is applied to the two-body problem without restriction on their masses, the result is remarkably simple.  To the lowest order, the relative motion of the two particles is equivalent to the motion of an infinitesimal particle in the field of their combined masses.  In other words, the Schwarzschild solution can be applied, provided that the ''M'' + ''m'' is used in place of ''M'' in the formulae for the Schwarzschild radius ''r''<sub>''s''</sub> and the precession angle per revolution \u03b4\u03c6.\n\n===Modern computational approaches===\n\n{{See also|Numerical relativity}}\n\nEinstein's equations can also be solved on a computer using sophisticated numerical methods.<ref name=\"Pretorius2005\"/><ref name=\"CampanelliLousto2006\"/><ref name=\"BakerCentrella2006\"/>  Given sufficient computer power, such solutions can be more accurate than post-Newtonian solutions.  However, such calculations are demanding because the equations must generally be solved in a four-dimensional space.
