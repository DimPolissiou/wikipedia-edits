It is a concept album about Cooper\u2019s stay in a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] due to his [[alcoholism]]. Each of the characters in the songs were based on actual people Cooper met in the sanitarium. Among other collaborators, the album features three longtime  [[Elton John]] associates: lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]], guitarist [[Davey Johnstone]] and bassist [[Dee Murray]].\n\nThe lead single from the album was the [[Sentimental_ballad#Power_ballads|power ballad]] \u201c[[How You Gonna See Me Now]]\u201d, which reached number 12 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100 chart]]. A [[music video]] was also created for it. The \u2018Madhouse Rocks Tour\u2019 in support of ''From the Inside'' lasted from February to April 1979 and saw all songs from the album as regular parts of the setlist except \u201cMillie and Billie\u201d, \u201cFor Veronica\u2019s Sake\u201d and \u201cJackknife Johnny\u201d.<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/albums/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html Alice Cooper setlists]</ref> Since 1979, however, songs from ''From the Inside'' have rarely been performed live, with the only cases being \u201cSerious\u201d on the 2003 \u2018Bare Bones\u2019 tour and his 2018 One Night With Alice Cooper tour.<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=Serious \u2018Serious\u2019 in setlists]</ref> \u201cWish I Were Born in Beverly Hills\u201d on the 2005\u20132006 ''[[Dirty Diamonds]]'' Tour,<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=Wish+I+Were+Born+in+Beverly+Hills \u2018Wish I Were Born in Beverly Hills\u2019 in setlists]</ref> \u201cNurse Rozetta\u201d on the \u2018Descent into Dragontown\u2019 and \u2018Theatre of Death\u2019 tours,<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=Nurse+Rozetta \u2018Nurse Rozetta\u2019 in setlists]</ref> and \u201cFrom the Inside\u201d between 1997 and 1999 and on the late 2000s \u2018Theatre of Death\u2019 tour. <ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=From+the+Inside \u2018From the Inside\u2019 in setlists]</ref>\n\nThe album was adapted into a comic book, ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #50.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=30 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\n== Artwork and packaging ==\nThe album cover is a centre parting gatefold with Alice Cooper's face on the front.

On the inside of the flap there is a message that reads \"Inmates! In memory of Moonie\", a nod to Cooper's old drinking buddy [[Keith Moon]]. The picture of Cooper in the cell is printed on the inner sleeve along with the song lyrics. On the rear of the album is a picture of the back of an asylum building with the track listing on the double doors, which open to show all the inmates stampeding down the corridor, waving papers in the air stating their release.

On an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache server]], this is commonly {{samp|/home/www}} (on [[Unix]] machines, usually {{samp|/var/www}}). The result is the local file system resource:\n\n /home/www/path/file.html\n\nThe web server then reads the [[Computer file|file]], if it exists, and sends a response to the client's web browser. The response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or is unavailable.\n\n==Kernel-mode and user-mode web servers==\nA web server can be either incorporated into the [[Operating system|OS]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], or in [[user space]] (like other regular applications).\n\nWeb servers that run in [[user-mode]] have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more CPU resources. Not only do these requests to the kernel take time, but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications. Executing in user mode can also mean useless buffer copies which are another limitation for user-mode web servers.\n\n==Load limits==\nA web server (program) has defined load limits, because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections (usually between 2 and 80,000, by default between 500 and 1,000) per [[IP address]] (and TCP port) and it can serve only a certain maximum number of ''{{visible anchor|requests per second}}'' (RPS, also known as [[queries per second]] or QPS) depending on:\n* its own settings,\n* the HTTP request type,\n* whether the content is static or dynamic,\n* whether the content is [[web cache|cached]], and\n* the [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] limitations of the OS of the computer on which the web server runs.\n\nWhen a web server is near to or over its limit, it becomes unresponsive.\n\n===Causes of overload===\nAt any time web servers can be overloaded due to:\n* Excess legitimate web traffic. Thousands or even millions of clients connecting to the web site in a short interval, e.g., [[Slashdot effect]];\n* [[Distributed Denial of Service]] attacks. A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users;\n* [[Computer worm]]s that sometimes cause abnormal traffic because of millions of infected computers (not coordinated among them)\n* [[XSS worm]]s can cause high traffic because of millions of infected browsers or web servers;\n* [[Internet bot]]s Traffic not filtered/limited on large web sites with very few resources (bandwidth, etc.);\n* [[Internet]] (network) slowdowns, so that client requests are served more slowly and the number of connections increases so much that server limits are reached;\n* Web servers ([[computer]]s) partial unavailability. This can happen because of required or urgent maintenance or upgrade, hardware or software failures, [[Front and back ends|back-end]] (e.g., [[database]]) failures, etc.; in these cases the remaining web servers get too much traffic and become overloaded.\n\n===Symptoms of overload===\nThe symptoms of an overloaded web server are:\n* Requests are served with (possibly long) delays (from 1 second to a few hundred seconds).\n* The web server returns an [[List of HTTP status codes|HTTP error code]], such as 500, 502,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/502-bad-gateway-error-explained-2622939|title=Getting a 502 Bad Gateway Error?

A web server can, in general, contain one or more [[website]]s. A web server processes incoming [[Computer network|network]] requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related [[Communication protocol|protocol]]s.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to clients.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=059600172X|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content. \n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the major function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|The world's first web server, a [[NeXT Computer]] workstation with Ethernet, 1990.

On an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache server]], this is commonly {{samp|/home/www}} (on [[Unix]] machines, usually {{samp|/var/www}}). The result is the local file system resource:\n\n /home/www/path/file.html\n\nThe web server then reads the [[Computer file|file]], if it exists, and sends a response to the client's web browser. The response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or is unavailable.\n\n==Kernel-mode and user-mode web servers==\nA web server can be either incorporated into the [[Operating system|OS]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], or in [[user space]] (like other regular applications).\n\nWeb servers that run in [[user-mode]] have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more CPU resources. Not only do these requests to the kernel take time, but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications. Executing in user mode can also mean useless buffer copies which are another limitation for user-mode web servers.\n\n==Load limits==\nA web server (program) has defined load limits, because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections (usually between 2 and 80,000, by default between 500 and 1,000) per [[IP address]] (and TCP port) and it can serve only a certain maximum number of ''{{visible anchor|requests per second}}'' (RPS, also known as [[queries per second]] or QPS) depending on:\n* its own settings,\n* the HTTP request type,\n* whether the content is static or dynamic,\n* whether the content is [[web cache|cached]], and\n* the [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] limitations of the OS of the computer on which the web server runs.\n\nWhen a web server is near to or over its limit, it becomes unresponsive.\n\n===Causes of overload===\nAt any time web servers can be overloaded due to:\n* Excess legitimate web traffic. Thousands or even millions of clients connecting to the web site in a short interval, e.g., [[Slashdot effect]];\n* [[Distributed Denial of Service]] attacks. A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users;\n* [[Computer worm]]s that sometimes cause abnormal traffic because of millions of infected computers (not coordinated among them)\n* [[XSS worm]]s can cause high traffic because of millions of infected browsers or web servers;\n* [[Internet bot]]s Traffic not filtered/limited on large web sites with very few resources (bandwidth, etc.);\n* [[Internet]] (network) slowdowns, so that client requests are served more slowly and the number of connections increases so much that server limits are reached;\n* Web servers ([[computer]]s) partial unavailability. This can happen because of required or urgent maintenance or upgrade, hardware or software failures, [[Front and back ends|back-end]] (e.g., [[database]]) failures, etc.; in these cases the remaining web servers get too much traffic and become overloaded.\n\n===Symptoms of overload===\nThe symptoms of an overloaded web server are:\n* Requests are served with (possibly long) delays (from 1 second to a few hundred seconds).\n* The web server returns an [[List of HTTP status codes|HTTP error code]], such as 500, 502,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/502-bad-gateway-error-explained-2622939|title=Getting a 502 Bad Gateway Error?

The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the communications path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that traverse that path.\n\nIn the OSI model, the definition of its [[application layer]] is narrower in scope than is often implemented. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the [[presentation layer]] below it. In an implementation, the application and presentation layers are frequently combined.\n\n====Method of attack====\nAn application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Kelly Jackson |coauthors= |title=DDoS Attack Used \u2018Headless\u2019 Browser In 150-Hour Siege |newspaper=Dark Reading |location= |pages= |language= |publisher=InformationWeek |date=17 October 2013 |url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122165039/http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}</ref> An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions.

Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker's ability to generate the overwhelming flux of packets. A common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a [[botnet]]. \n\n===Attack tools===\nIn cases such as [[MyDoom]] and [[Slowloris (computer security)|Slowloris]] the tools are embedded in [[malware]] and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]] which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\" />\n\nIn other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]] organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] has typically been used in this way. Along with [[High Orbit Ion Cannon]] a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker related forums and IRC channels.\n\n===Application-layer attacks===\nApplication-layer attacks employ DoS-causing [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] and can cause server-running software to fill the disk space or consume all available memory or [[CPU time]]. Attacks may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs. An attacker with shell-level access to a victim's computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a [[fork bomb]]. Another kind of application-level DoS attack is [[XDoS]] (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web [[application firewall]]s (WAFs).\n\nAnother target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on [[cloud computing]]. In this case normally application-used resources are tied to a needed quality of service (QoS) level (e.g. responses should be less than 200&nbsp;ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/|title=Amazon CloudWatch|work=Amazon Web Services, Inc.}}</ref>) to raise more virtual resources from the provider in order to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests. The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels in order to handle the increased application traffic, in order to cause financial losses or force them to become less competitive. \n\nA ''banana attack'' is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A [[LAND]] attack is of this type.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Degradation-of-service attacks===\n\"Pulsing\" zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as \"degradation-of-service\" rather than \"denial-of-service\", can be more difficult to detect than regular zombie invasions and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more disruption than concentrated floods.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Of Information Technology |page=397 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distributors |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-269-0752-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law |year=2006 |page=325 |first=Aaron |last=Schwabach |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-731-9}}</ref> Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or under normal traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book|title=Networking and Mobile Computing |first=Xicheng |last=Lu |author2=Wei Zhao |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-540-28102-3 |page=424}}</ref>\n\n===Denial-of-service Level II===\nThe goal of DoS L2 (possibly DDoS) attack is to cause a launching of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated. In case of distributed attack or IP header modification (that depends on the kind of security behavior) it will fully block the attacked network from the Internet, but without system crash.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Distributed DoS attack===\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.<ref name=\"Taghavi Zargar 2046\u20132069\"/> Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Has Your Website Been Bitten By a Zombie?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/08/has-your-website-been-bitten-by-zombie.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.\n\nMalware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was [[MyDoom]]. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack.\n\nA system may also be compromised with a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]], allowing the attacker to download a [[Zombie computer|zombie agent]], or the trojan may contain one. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]], which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\">{{cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis.txt |title=The \"stacheldraht\" distributed denial of service attack tool |first=David |last=Dittrich |publisher=University of Washington |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]], organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as: TCP, UDP, ICMP etc.\n\nThese collections of systems compromisers are known as [[botnet]]s / [[rootserver]]s. DDoS tools like [[Stacheldraht]] still use classic DoS attack methods centered on [[IP spoofing]] and amplification like [[smurf attack]]s and [[fraggle attack]]s (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). [[SYN flood]]s (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. [[Script kiddie]]s use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users.<ref name=\"SANS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|title=SANS Institute \u2013 Intrusion Detection FAQ: Distributed Denial of Service Attack Tools: n/a|accessdate=2008-05-02|publisher=SANS Institute|year=2000|first=Phillip|last=Boyle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515025103/http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|archive-date=2008-05-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of [[extortion]]{{spaced ndash}}even against their business rivals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/23/authorize_ddos_attack/ |title=US credit card firm fights DDoS attack |work=The Register |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>\n\nSimple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses, giving the appearance of a well distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP [[Three way handshake#Connection establishment|three way handshake]] and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as [[syn cookies]] may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.{{elucidate|date=May 2011}}\n\nIf an attacker mounts an attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack.

However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the 'Content-Length' field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections, until all resources for incoming connections on the server (the victim) are used up, hence making any further (including legitimate) connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other (D)DoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, a HTTP POST attack targets the ''logical'' resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough network bandwidth and processing power to operate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/images/4/43/Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|title=OWASP Plan - Strawman - Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=18 March 2014|website= Open Web Application Security Project|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> Further combined with the fact that [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful.

The process typically involves an attacker sending a DNS name look up request to a public DNS server, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006|url=http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |title=DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=ISOTF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214074629/http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14|author1=Vaughn, Randal |author2=Evron, Gadi }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=July 8, 2013 |title=Alert (TA13-088A) DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=US-CERT |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref> SNMP and [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] can also be exploited as reflector in an amplification attack.\n\nAn example of an amplified DDoS attack through the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim.\n\nIt is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. In order to bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which has led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.\n\n=== Mirai botnet ===\nThis attack works by using a worm to infect hundreds of thousands of IoT devices across the internet.

It is achieved by advertising a very small number for the TCP Receive Window size, and at the same time emptying clients' TCP receive buffer slowly, which causes a very low data flow rate.\n\n{{anchor|DDoS}}\n\n===Sophisticated low-bandwidth Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack===\nA sophisticated low-bandwidth DDoS attack is a form of DoS that uses less traffic and increases their effectiveness by aiming at a weak point in the victim's system design, i.e., the attacker sends traffic consisting of complicated requests to the system.<ref name=\"Ben-Porat 1031\u20131043\">{{Cite journal|title = Vulnerability of Network Mechanisms to Sophisticated DDoS Attacks|journal = IEEE Transactions on Computers|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 0018-9340|pages = 1031\u20131043|volume = 62|issue = 5|doi = 10.1109/TC.2012.49|first = U.|last = Ben-Porat|first2 = A.|last2 = Bremler-Barr|first3 = H.|last3 = Levy}}</ref> Essentially, a sophisticated DDoS attack is lower in cost due to its use of less traffic, is smaller in size making it more difficult to identify, and it has the ability to hurt systems which are protected by flow control mechanisms.<ref name=\"Ben-Porat 1031\u20131043\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/slow-http-test/|title=Slow HTTP Test|author=orbitalsatelite|work=SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n===(S)SYN flood===\n{{See also|SYN flood}}\nA [[SYN flood]] occurs when a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged sender address. Each of these packets are handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn a [[half-open connection]], by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the sender address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4987 |title=TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations |website=Tools.ietf.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-02 |rfc=4987}}</ref>\n\n===Teardrop attacks===\nA teardrop attack involves sending [[Mangled packet|mangled]] [[Internet Protocol|IP]] fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to the target machine. This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their [[TCP/IP]] [[IPv4#Fragmentation and reassembly|fragmentation re-assembly]] code.<ref name=\"CERT-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/historical/advisories/ca-1997-28.cfm|title=CERT Advisory CA-1997-28 IP Denial-of-Service Attacks|accessdate=July 18, 2014|publisher=CERT|year=1998}}</ref> [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]] operating systems, as well as versions of [[Linux]] prior to versions 2.0.32 and 2.1.63 are vulnerable to this attack.\n\n(Although in September 2009, a vulnerability in [[Windows Vista]] was referred to as a \"teardrop attack\", this targeted [[Server Message Block|SMB2]] which is a higher layer than the TCP packets that teardrop used).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/windows-7-vista-exposed-to-teardrop-attack/4222 |title=Windows 7, Vista exposed to 'teardrop attack' |work=ZDNet |date=September 8, 2009 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/975497.mspx |title=Microsoft Security Advisory (975497): Vulnerabilities in SMB Could Allow Remote Code Execution |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=September 8, 2009 <!--last updated February 06, 2013-->|accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of the fields in an IP header is the \u201cfragment offset\u201d field, indicating the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets - resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n===Telephony denial-of-service (TDoS)===\n[[Voice over IP]] has made abusive origination of large numbers of [[telephone]] voice calls inexpensive and readily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through [[caller ID spoofing]].\n\nAccording to the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes:\n* A scammer contacts the victim's banker or broker, impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer. The banker's attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim's telephone lines are being flooded with thousands of bogus calls, rendering the victim unreachable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2010/nk051110.htm |title=FBI \u2014 Phony Phone Calls Distract Consumers from Genuine Theft |publisher=FBI.gov |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding [[payday loan]] for thousands of dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim's employer with thousands of automated calls. In some cases, displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2013/130107.aspx |title= Internet Crime Complaint Center's (IC3) Scam Alerts January 7, 2013 |work=IC3.gov |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police; when the victim balks, the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victim's number. Police soon arrive at the victim's residence attempting to find the origin of the calls.\n\nTelephony denial-of-service can exist even without [[Internet telephony]]. In the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], [[telemarketing|telemarketers]] were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-[[area code]]-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily in response to the song [[867-5309/Jenny]].\n\nTDoS differs from other [[telephone harassment]] (such as [[prank call]]s and [[obscene phone call]]s) by the number of calls originated; by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls.\n\nRelated exploits include [[SMS flooding]] attacks and [[black fax]] or fax loop transmission.\n\n=== TTL expiry attack ===\nIt takes more router resources to drop a packet with a TTL value of 1 or less than it does to forward a packet with higher TTL value. When a packet is dropped due to TTL expiry, the router CPU must generate and send an [[ICMP time exceeded]] response. Generating many of these responses can overload the router's CPU.<ref>{{cite web |title=TTL Expiry Attack Identification and Mitigation |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ttl-expiry-attack.html |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n=== UPnP attack ===\nThis attack uses an existing vulnerability in [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) protocol to get around a considerable amount of the present defense methods and flood a target's network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router which forwards requests from one outer source to another disregarding UPnP behavior rules. Using the UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it harder to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the [[Imperva]] researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.darkreading.com/new-ddos-attack-method-leverages-upnp/d/d-id/1331799|title=New DDoS Attack Method Leverages UPnP|work=Dark Reading|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperva.com/blog/2018/05/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation/|title=New DDoS Attack Method Demands a Fresh Approach to Amplification Assault Mitigation \u2013 Blog {{!}} Imperva|date=2018-05-14|work=Blog {{!}} Imperva|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Defense techniques==\nDefensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput.

It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches. Application front end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the system, and then identifies them as priority, regular, or dangerous. There are more than 25 [[bandwidth management]] vendors.\n\n===Application level Key Completion Indicators===\n{{original research|section|date=March 2018|the analogy is complex enough that it should be sourced}}\nApproaches to DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate and thus triggering elasticity decisions without the economical implications of a DDoS attack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alqahtani|first1=S.|last2=Gamble|first2=R. F.|title=DDoS Attacks in Service Clouds|journal=2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)|date=1 January 2015|pages=5331\u20135340|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.627|isbn=978-1-4799-7367-5}}</ref> These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called Key Completion Indicators.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kousiouris|first=George|title=KEY COMPLETION INDICATORS:minimizing the effect of DoS attacks on elastic Cloud-based applications based on application-level markov chain checkpoints |newspaper=CLOSER Conference|date=2014|doi=10.5220/0004963006220628}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, these technique are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on.\n\nAn analogy is to a bricks-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. If a mob of customers arrived in store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.\n\nThe department store can attempt to adjust to periods of high activity by bringing in a reserve of employees at short notice. But if it did this routinely, were a mob to start showing up but never buying anything, this could ruin the store with the extra employee costs. Soon the store would identify the mob activity and scale back the number of employees, recognising that the mob provides no profit and should not be served. While this may make it more difficult for legitimate customers to get served during the mob's presence, it saves the store from total ruin.\n\nIn the case of elastic cloud services where a huge and abnormal additional workload may incur significant charges from the cloud service provider, this technique can be used to scale back or even stop the expansion of server availability to protect from economic loss.\n\n===Blackholing and sinkholing===\nWith [[blackhole routing]], all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a \"black hole\" (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patrikakis |first1=C. |last2=Masikos |first2=M. |last3=Zouraraki |first3=O. |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attacks |journal=The Internet Protocol Journal |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=13\u201335 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-4/dos_attacks.html}}</ref>\n\nA [[DNS sinkhole]] routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing is not efficient for most severe attacks.\n\n===IPS based prevention===\n[[Intrusion prevention system]]s (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nAn [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the [[Bandwidth (computing)|processing power]] and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a [[circuit breaker]] in an automated way.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nA [[RateBasedIPS|rate-based IPS]] (RBIPS) must analyze traffic granularly and continuously monitor the traffic pattern and determine if there is traffic anomaly.

A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods).\n\n===Firewalls===\nIn the case of a simple attack, a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] could have a simple rule added to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports or the originating IP addresses.\n\nMore complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/94014/How_to_defend_against_DDoS_attacks|first=Paul |last=Froutan|title=How to defend against DDoS attacks|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=June 24, 2004|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls often might get bypassed during the attacks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445613/Cyber-security-vulnerability-concerns-skyrocket|title=Cyber security vulnerability concerns skyrocket|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Routers===\nSimilar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. [[Cisco IOS]] has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |title=Some IoS tips for Internet Service (Providers) |first=Mehmet |last=Suzen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910202908/http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Switches===\nMost switches have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. Some switches provide automatic and/or system-wide [[rate limiting]], [[traffic shaping]], [[delayed binding]] ([[TCP splicing]]), [[deep packet inspection]] and [[Bogon filtering]] (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nThese schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks originating from [[Martian packet|dark addresses]] or going to dark addresses can be prevented using [[bogon filtering]]. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate-thresholds have been set correctly. Wan-link failover will work as long as both links have DoS/DDoS prevention mechanism.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Upstream filtering===\nAll traffic is passed through a \"cleaning center\" or a \"scrubbing center\" via various methods such as proxies, tunnels, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits, which separates \"bad\" traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only sends good traffic beyond to the server. The provider needs central connectivity to the Internet to manage this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the \"cleaning center\" or \"scrubbing center\". DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |title=DDoS Mitigation via Regional Cleaning Centers (Jan 2004) |work=SprintLabs.com |publisher=Sprint ATL Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921012859/http://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}<!-- use archive due to outage--></ref>\n\n==Unintentional denial-of-service==\nAn unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular users{{spaced ndash}}potentially hundreds of thousands of people{{spaced ndash}}click that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity.\n\nWhen [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson died]] in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8120324.stm | work=BBC News | first=Maggie | last=Shiels | title=Web slows after Jackson's death | date=2009-06-26}}</ref> Many sites' servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like \"automated requests from a [[computer virus]] or spyware application\".<ref>{{cite web |url=<!--last updated February 06, 2013-->http://productforums.google.com/forum/?#!category-topic/websearch/unexpected-search-results/uFcXXixhiBw |title=We're Sorry.

The canonical example is the [[Slashdot effect]] when receiving traffic from [[Slashdot]]. It is also known as \"the [[Reddit]] hug of death\" and \"the [[Digg]] effect\".\n\nRouters have also been known to create unintentional DoS attacks, as both [[D-Link]] and [[Netgear]] routers have overloaded NTP servers by flooding NTP servers without respecting the restrictions of client types or geographical limitations.\n\nSimilar unintentional denials-of-service can also occur via other media, e.g. when a URL is mentioned on television. If a server is being indexed by [[Google]] or another [[search engine]] during peak periods of activity, or does not have a lot of available bandwidth while being indexed, it can also experience the effects of a DoS attack.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|reason=I've never seen Google send more than one request per minute to my server, usually much less often than that.

In 2006, [[Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment|Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment Corporation]] sued [[YouTube]]: massive numbers of would-be YouTube.com users accidentally typed the tube company's URL, utube.com.

In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caida.org/publications/animations/ |work=Animations |title=Backscatter Analysis (2001) |type=video |publisher=[[Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis]] |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIf the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly, the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations. This effect can be used by [[network telescope]]s as indirect evidence of such attacks.\n\nThe term \"backscatter analysis\" refers to observing backscatter packets arriving at a statistically significant portion of the [[IP address]] space to determine characteristics of DoS attacks and victims.\n\nMany jurisdictions have laws under which denial-of-service attacks are illegal.\n\n* In the US, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the  with penalties that include years of imprisonment The  of the US  handles cases of (D)DoS.

The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the communications path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that traverse that path.\n\nIn the OSI model, the definition of its [[application layer]] is narrower in scope than is often implemented. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the [[presentation layer]] below it. In an implementation, the application and presentation layers are frequently combined.\n\n====Method of attack====\nAn application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Kelly Jackson |coauthors= |title=DDoS Attack Used \u2018Headless\u2019 Browser In 150-Hour Siege |newspaper=Dark Reading |location= |pages= |language= |publisher=InformationWeek |date=17 October 2013 |url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122165039/http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-15/240162777 |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}</ref> An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions.

Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker's ability to generate the overwhelming flux of packets. A common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a [[botnet]]. \n\n===Attack tools===\nIn cases such as [[MyDoom]] and [[Slowloris (computer security)|Slowloris]] the tools are embedded in [[malware]] and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]] which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\" />\n\nIn other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]] organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] has typically been used in this way. Along with [[High Orbit Ion Cannon]] a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker related forums and IRC channels.\n\n===Application-layer attacks===\nApplication-layer attacks employ DoS-causing [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] and can cause server-running software to fill the disk space or consume all available memory or [[CPU time]]. Attacks may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs. An attacker with shell-level access to a victim's computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a [[fork bomb]]. Another kind of application-level DoS attack is [[XDoS]] (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web [[application firewall]]s (WAFs).\n\nAnother target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on [[cloud computing]]. In this case normally application-used resources are tied to a needed quality of service (QoS) level (e.g. responses should be less than 200&nbsp;ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/|title=Amazon CloudWatch|work=Amazon Web Services, Inc.}}</ref>) to raise more virtual resources from the provider in order to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests. The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels in order to handle the increased application traffic, in order to cause financial losses or force them to become less competitive. \n\nA ''banana attack'' is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A [[LAND]] attack is of this type.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Degradation-of-service attacks===\n\"Pulsing\" zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as \"degradation-of-service\" rather than \"denial-of-service\", can be more difficult to detect than regular zombie invasions and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more disruption than concentrated floods.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Of Information Technology |page=397 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distributors |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-269-0752-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law |year=2006 |page=325 |first=Aaron |last=Schwabach |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-731-9}}</ref> Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or under normal traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book|title=Networking and Mobile Computing |first=Xicheng |last=Lu |author2=Wei Zhao |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-540-28102-3 |page=424}}</ref>\n\n===Denial-of-service Level II===\nThe goal of DoS L2 (possibly DDoS) attack is to cause a launching of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated. In case of distributed attack or IP header modification (that depends on the kind of security behavior) it will fully block the attacked network from the Internet, but without system crash.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Distributed DoS attack===\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.<ref name=\"Taghavi Zargar 2046\u20132069\"/> Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. A botnet is a network of zombie computers programmed to receive commands without the owners' knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Has Your Website Been Bitten By a Zombie?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/08/has-your-website-been-bitten-by-zombie.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted. The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial-of-service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder to track and shut down. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. This, after all, will end up completely crashing a website for periods of time.\n\nMalware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was [[MyDoom]]. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack.\n\nA system may also be compromised with a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]], allowing the attacker to download a [[Zombie computer|zombie agent]], or the trojan may contain one. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. [[Stacheldraht]] is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a [[Client (computing)|client program]] to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the [[Zombie computer|zombie agents]], which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.<ref name=\"Dittrich\">{{cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis.txt |title=The \"stacheldraht\" distributed denial of service attack tool |first=David |last=Dittrich |publisher=University of Washington |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in [[Operation Payback]], organized by the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as: TCP, UDP, ICMP etc.\n\nThese collections of systems compromisers are known as [[botnet]]s / [[rootserver]]s. DDoS tools like [[Stacheldraht]] still use classic DoS attack methods centered on [[IP spoofing]] and amplification like [[smurf attack]]s and [[fraggle attack]]s (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). [[SYN flood]]s (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. [[Script kiddie]]s use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users.<ref name=\"SANS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|title=SANS Institute \u2013 Intrusion Detection FAQ: Distributed Denial of Service Attack Tools: n/a|accessdate=2008-05-02|publisher=SANS Institute|year=2000|first=Phillip|last=Boyle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515025103/http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/trinoo.php|archive-date=2008-05-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of [[extortion]]{{spaced ndash}}even against their business rivals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/23/authorize_ddos_attack/ |title=US credit card firm fights DDoS attack |work=The Register |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>\n\nSimple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses, giving the appearance of a well distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP [[Three way handshake#Connection establishment|three way handshake]] and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as [[syn cookies]] may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.{{elucidate|date=May 2011}}\n\nIf an attacker mounts an attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack. On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack.\n\nIt has been reported that there are new attacks from [[internet of things]] (IoT) devices which have been involved in denial of service attacks.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehackernews.com/2015/10/cctv-camera-hacking.html|title=Hacking CCTV Cameras to Launch DDoS Attacks|author=Swati Khandelwal|date=23 October 2015|work=The Hacker News}}</ref>\nIn one noted attack that was made peaked at around 20,000 requests per second which came from around 900 CCTV cameras.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.incapsula.com/blog/cctv-ddos-botnet-back-yard.html|title=CCTV DDoS Botnet In Our Own Back Yard|first1=Igal|last1=Zeifman|first2=Ofer|last2=Gayer|first3=Or|last3=Wilder|website=incapsula.com|date=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nUK's [[GCHQ]] has tools built for DDoS, named PREDATORS FACE and ROLLING THUNDER.<ref name=\"firstlook.org\">{{cite web |date=2014-07-15 |author= Glenn Greenwald |url=https://theintercept.com/2014/07/14/manipulating-online-polls-ways-british-spies-seek-control-internet/ |title=HACKING ONLINE POLLS AND OTHER WAYS BRITISH SPIES SEEK TO CONTROL THE INTERNET |website=The Intercept_ |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref>\n\n===DDoS extortion===\nIn 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, taking aim at financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who's Behind DDoS Attacks and How Can You Protect Your Website?|url=http://blog.cloudbric.com/2015/09/whos-behind-ddos-attacks-and-how-can.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Cloudbric|date=10 September 2015}}</ref> Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack will be carried out if a ransom is not paid in [[Bitcoin]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=Cyber-Extortionists Targeting the Financial Sector Are Demanding Bitcoin Ransoms|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/bitcoin-ddos-ransom-demands-raise-dd4bc-profile?mod=djemRiskCompliance|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Bloomberg|date=9 September 2015}}</ref> Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom.

However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the 'Content-Length' field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections, until all resources for incoming connections on the server (the victim) are used up, hence making any further (including legitimate) connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other (D)DoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, a HTTP POST attack targets the ''logical'' resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough network bandwidth and processing power to operate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/images/4/43/Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|title=OWASP Plan - Strawman - Layer_7_DDOS.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=18 March 2014|website= Open Web Application Security Project|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> Further combined with the fact that [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful.

The process typically involves an attacker sending a DNS name look up request to a public DNS server, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006|url=http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |title=DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=ISOTF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214074629/http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14|author1=Vaughn, Randal |author2=Evron, Gadi }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=July 8, 2013 |title=Alert (TA13-088A) DNS Amplification Attacks |publisher=US-CERT |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref> SNMP and [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] can also be exploited as reflector in an amplification attack.\n\nAn example of an amplified DDoS attack through the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim.\n\nIt is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. In order to bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which has led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.\n\n=== Mirai botnet ===\nThis attack works by using a worm to infect hundreds of thousands of IoT devices across the internet.

Each of these packets are handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn a [[half-open connection]], by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the sender address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4987 |title=TCP SYN Flooding Attacks and Common Mitigations |website=Tools.ietf.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-02 |rfc=4987}}</ref>\n\n===Teardrop attacks===\nA teardrop attack involves sending [[Mangled packet|mangled]] [[Internet Protocol|IP]] fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to the target machine.

If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets - resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n===Telephony denial-of-service (TDoS)===\n[[Voice over IP]] has made abusive origination of large numbers of [[telephone]] voice calls inexpensive and readily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through [[caller ID spoofing]].\n\nAccording to the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes:\n* A scammer contacts the victim's banker or broker, impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer. The banker's attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim's telephone lines are being flooded with thousands of bogus calls, rendering the victim unreachable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2010/nk051110.htm |title=FBI \u2014 Phony Phone Calls Distract Consumers from Genuine Theft |publisher=FBI.gov |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding [[payday loan]] for thousands of dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim's employer with thousands of automated calls. In some cases, displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2013/130107.aspx |title= Internet Crime Complaint Center's (IC3) Scam Alerts January 7, 2013 |work=IC3.gov |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>\n* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police; when the victim balks, the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victim's number. Police soon arrive at the victim's residence attempting to find the origin of the calls.\n\nTelephony denial-of-service can exist even without [[Internet telephony]]. In the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], [[telemarketing|telemarketers]] were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-[[area code]]-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily in response to the song [[867-5309/Jenny]].\n\nTDoS differs from other [[telephone harassment]] (such as [[prank call]]s and [[obscene phone call]]s) by the number of calls originated; by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls.\n\nRelated exploits include [[SMS flooding]] attacks and [[black fax]] or fax loop transmission.\n\n=== TTL expiry attack ===\nIt takes more router resources to drop a packet with a TTL value of 1 or less than it does to forward a packet with higher TTL value. When a packet is dropped due to TTL expiry, the router CPU must generate and send an [[ICMP time exceeded]] response. Generating many of these responses can overload the router's CPU.<ref>{{cite web |title=TTL Expiry Attack Identification and Mitigation |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ttl-expiry-attack.html |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n=== UPnP attack ===\nThis attack uses an existing vulnerability in [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) protocol to get around a considerable amount of the present defense methods and flood a target's network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router which forwards requests from one outer source to another disregarding UPnP behavior rules. Using the UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it harder to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the [[Imperva]] researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.darkreading.com/new-ddos-attack-method-leverages-upnp/d/d-id/1331799|title=New DDoS Attack Method Leverages UPnP|work=Dark Reading|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperva.com/blog/2018/05/new-ddos-attack-method-demands-a-fresh-approach-to-amplification-assault-mitigation/|title=New DDoS Attack Method Demands a Fresh Approach to Amplification Assault Mitigation \u2013 Blog {{!}} Imperva|date=2018-05-14|work=Blog {{!}} Imperva|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Defense techniques==\nDefensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput.

It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches. Application front end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the system, and then identifies them as priority, regular, or dangerous. There are more than 25 [[bandwidth management]] vendors.\n\n===Application level Key Completion Indicators===\n{{original research|section|date=March 2018|the analogy is complex enough that it should be sourced}}\nApproaches to DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate and thus triggering elasticity decisions without the economical implications of a DDoS attack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alqahtani|first1=S.|last2=Gamble|first2=R. F.|title=DDoS Attacks in Service Clouds|journal=2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)|date=1 January 2015|pages=5331\u20135340|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.627|isbn=978-1-4799-7367-5}}</ref> These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called Key Completion Indicators.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kousiouris|first=George|title=KEY COMPLETION INDICATORS:minimizing the effect of DoS attacks on elastic Cloud-based applications based on application-level markov chain checkpoints |newspaper=CLOSER Conference|date=2014|doi=10.5220/0004963006220628}}</ref>\n\nIn essence, these technique are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on.\n\nAn analogy is to a bricks-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. If a mob of customers arrived in store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.\n\nThe department store can attempt to adjust to periods of high activity by bringing in a reserve of employees at short notice. But if it did this routinely, were a mob to start showing up but never buying anything, this could ruin the store with the extra employee costs. Soon the store would identify the mob activity and scale back the number of employees, recognising that the mob provides no profit and should not be served. While this may make it more difficult for legitimate customers to get served during the mob's presence, it saves the store from total ruin.\n\nIn the case of elastic cloud services where a huge and abnormal additional workload may incur significant charges from the cloud service provider, this technique can be used to scale back or even stop the expansion of server availability to protect from economic loss.\n\n===Blackholing and sinkholing===\nWith [[blackhole routing]], all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a \"black hole\" (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patrikakis |first1=C. |last2=Masikos |first2=M. |last3=Zouraraki |first3=O. |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attacks |journal=The Internet Protocol Journal |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=13\u201335 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-4/dos_attacks.html}}</ref>\n\nA [[DNS sinkhole]] routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing is not efficient for most severe attacks.\n\n===IPS based prevention===\n[[Intrusion prevention system]]s (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nAn [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the [[Bandwidth (computing)|processing power]] and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a [[circuit breaker]] in an automated way.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nA [[RateBasedIPS|rate-based IPS]] (RBIPS) must analyze traffic granularly and continuously monitor the traffic pattern and determine if there is traffic anomaly.

A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods).\n\n===Firewalls===\nIn the case of a simple attack, a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] could have a simple rule added to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports or the originating IP addresses.\n\nMore complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/94014/How_to_defend_against_DDoS_attacks|first=Paul |last=Froutan|title=How to defend against DDoS attacks|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=June 24, 2004|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls often might get bypassed during the attacks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445613/Cyber-security-vulnerability-concerns-skyrocket|title=Cyber security vulnerability concerns skyrocket|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n===Routers===\nSimilar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. [[Cisco IOS]] has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |title=Some IoS tips for Internet Service (Providers) |first=Mehmet |last=Suzen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910202908/http://mehmet.suzen.googlepages.com/qos_ios_dos_suzen2005.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Switches===\nMost switches have some rate-limiting and [[Access control list|ACL]] capability. Some switches provide automatic and/or system-wide [[rate limiting]], [[traffic shaping]], [[delayed binding]] ([[TCP splicing]]), [[deep packet inspection]] and [[Bogon filtering]] (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nThese schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks originating from [[Martian packet|dark addresses]] or going to dark addresses can be prevented using [[bogon filtering]]. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate-thresholds have been set correctly. Wan-link failover will work as long as both links have DoS/DDoS prevention mechanism.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Upstream filtering===\nAll traffic is passed through a \"cleaning center\" or a \"scrubbing center\" via various methods such as proxies, tunnels, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits, which separates \"bad\" traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only sends good traffic beyond to the server. The provider needs central connectivity to the Internet to manage this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the \"cleaning center\" or \"scrubbing center\". DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |title=DDoS Mitigation via Regional Cleaning Centers (Jan 2004) |work=SprintLabs.com |publisher=Sprint ATL Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921012859/http://research.sprintlabs.com/publications/uploads/RR04-ATL-013177.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}<!-- use archive due to outage--></ref>\n\n==Unintentional denial-of-service==\nAn unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular users{{spaced ndash}}potentially hundreds of thousands of people{{spaced ndash}}click that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity.\n\nWhen [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson died]] in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8120324.stm | work=BBC News | first=Maggie | last=Shiels | title=Web slows after Jackson's death | date=2009-06-26}}</ref> Many sites' servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like \"automated requests from a [[computer virus]] or spyware application\".<ref>{{cite web |url=<!--last updated February 06, 2013-->http://productforums.google.com/forum/?#!category-topic/websearch/unexpected-search-results/uFcXXixhiBw |title=We're Sorry.

If a server is being indexed by [[Google]] or another [[search engine]] during peak periods of activity, or does not have a lot of available bandwidth while being indexed, it can also experience the effects of a DoS attack.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|reason=I've never seen Google send more than one request per minute to my server, usually much less often than that.

In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caida.org/publications/animations/ |work=Animations |title=Backscatter Analysis (2001) |type=video |publisher=[[Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis]] |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIf the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly, the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations.

The season began on 6 August 2011 and will end at a yet unknown date in 2012, with a winter break beginning on 8 December 2011.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[FK Mogren|Mogren]] are the defending champions.\n\n== Teams ==\n[[OFK Bar|Bar]] were directly relegated to the Montenegrin Second League after finishing 12th at the end of [[2010\u201311 Montenegrin First League|last season]]; the club returned to the second level after just one year. Their place was taken by 2010\u201311 [[Montenegrin Second League|Second League]] champions [[FK Bokelj|Bokelj]], who returned to the top league of Montenegro after an absence of three seasons.\n\n10th-placed [[FK Mornar|Mornar]] and 11th-placed [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] had to compete in two-legged relegation play-offs. Sutjeska kept their place in the First League by beating Second League runners-up [[FK Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje|Jedinstvo Bijelo Polje]] 1\u20130 on aggregate. On the other hand, Mornar were relegated after losing to Second League third-placed team [[FK Berane]] on [[Away goals rule|away goals]]; the two-leg affair ended 1\u20131. Berane thus made their immediate return to the league, while Mornar were relegated after two seasons in the top flight.\n\n===Stadia and locations===\n{{Location

As the [[Germanic languages]] descend from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE), [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] have traced the name to a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn *''{{PIE|[[Hausos|H\u2082ews\u1e53s]]}}'' (\u2192 *''{{PIE|Aus\u1e53s}}''), from which descends the Common Germanic divinity from whom {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} and {{lang|goh|Ostara|italic=no}} are held to descend. Additionally, scholars have linked the goddess's name to a variety of Germanic personal names, a series of location names ([[toponymy|toponyms]]) in England, and, discovered in 1958, over 150 inscriptions from the 2nd century CE referring to the ''{{lang|la|[[matres and Matronae|matronae]] Austriahenae}}''.\n\nTheories connecting {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} with records of Germanic [[Easter customs]], including [[hare#Folklore and mythology|hares]] and [[easter egg|eggs]], have been proposed. Particularly prior to the discovery of the ''{{lang|la|matronae Austriahenae}}'' and further developments in [[Indo-European studies]], debate has occurred among some scholars about whether or not the goddess was an invention of Bede. \u0112ostre and Ostara are sometimes referenced in modern popular culture and are venerated in some forms of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic neopaganism]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre}} continues into modern English as ''Easter'' and derives from [[Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/Austr\u01ed|Austr\u01ed]]}}, itself a descendant of the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2082ews-|h\u2082ews-]]}}'', meaning 'to shine' (modern English ''east'' also derives from this root).<ref name=\"WATKINS-2021\">Watkins 2006 [2000]: 2021.</ref>\n\nThe goddess name {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre}} is therefore linguistically [[cognate]] with numerous other dawn goddesses attested among Indo-European language-speaking peoples. These cognates lead to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess; the ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]'' details that \"a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn is supported both by the evidence of cognate names and the similarity of mythic representation of the dawn goddess among various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] groups\u201d and that \u201call of this evidence permits us to posit a Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|[[hausos|h<sub>a</sub>\u00e9us\u014ds]]}}'' 'goddess of dawn' who was characterized as a \"reluctant\" bringer of light for which she is punished. In three of the Indo-European stocks, [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], the existence of a Proto-Indo-European 'goddess of the dawn' is given additional linguistic support in that she is designated the 'daughter of heaven'.\"<ref name=\"EOIEC\">Mallory & Adams (1997:148\u2013149).</ref>\n\n===Related names===\nBy way of [[linguistic reconstruction]], the matter of a goddess called {{lang|gem-x-proto|Austr\u014d}} in the [[Proto-Germanic language]] has been examined in detail since the foundation of [[Germanic philology]] in the 19th century by scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] and others.

The [[Council of Austerfield]] called by King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]] shortly before 704 convened at a place described in contemporary records both as {{lang|la|in campo qui {{lang|ang|Eostrefeld}} dicitur}} and {{lang|la|in campo qui dicitur {{lang|ang|Oustraefelda}}}}, which have led to the site's being identified with [[Austerfield]] near [[Bawtry]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].<ref>Cubitt, Catherine (1995).

Some of these inscriptions refer to the {{lang|la|Austriates}}, evidently the name of a social group.<ref name=\"SHAW52-AND-63\">Shaw (2011:52 and 63).</ref>\n\n==Bede's Eostre==\nIn chapter 15 ({{lang|la|De mensibus Anglorum|italic=yes}}, \"The English months\") of his 8th-century work {{lang|la|De temporum ratione|italic=yes}} (\"''[[The Reckoning of Time]]''\"), [[Bede]] describes the indigenous month names of the English people. After describing the worship of the goddess [[Rheda (mythology)|Rheda]] during the Anglo-Saxon month of {{lang|ang|Hr\u0113\u00fe-m\u014dna\u00fe}}, Bede writes about ''{{lang|ang|\u0112osturm\u014dna\u00fe}}'', the month of the goddess \u0112ostre:\n{{Verse translation |lang=la\n|{{lang|ang|Eostur-monath}}, qui nunc Paschalis mensis interpretatur, quondam a Dea illorum qu\u00e6 {{lang|ang|Eostre}} vocabatur, et cui in illo festa celebrabant nomen habuit: a cujus nomine nunc Paschale tempus cognominant, consueto antiqu\u00e6 observationis vocabulo gaudia nov\u00e6 solemnitatis vocantes.<ref name=\"GILES179\">Giles (1843:179).</ref>\n|{{lang|ang|Eosturmonath}} has a name which is now translated \"Paschal month\", and which was once called after a goddess of theirs named {{lang|ang|Eostre}}, in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month. Now they designate that Paschal season by her name, calling the joys of the new rite by the time-honoured name of the old observance.<ref name=\"WALLIS54\">Wallis (1999:54).</ref>}}\n\nSome debate has occurred over whether or not the goddess was an invention of Bede's. Writing in the late 19th century, [[Charles J. Billson]] notes that scholars before his writing were divided about the existence of Bede's account of \u0112ostre, stating that \"among authorities who have no doubt as to her existence are [[Wilhelm Grimm|W. Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Wackernagel|Wackernagel]], [[Karl Joseph Simrock|Sinrock]] {{sic}}, and Wolf. On the other hand, Weinhold rejects the idea on philological grounds, and so do Heinrich Leo and Hermann Oesre. Kuhn says, 'The Anglo-Saxon {{lang|ang|Eostre|italic=no}} looks like an invention of Bede;' and [[Wilhelm Mannhardt|Mannhardt]] also dismisses her as an etymological {{lang|la|[[deus ex machina|dea ex machina]]}}.\" Billson says that \"the whole question turns ... upon Bede's credibility\", and that \"one is inclined to agree with Grimm, that it would be uncritical to saddle this eminent Father of the Church, who keeps Heathendom at arms' length and tells us less of than he knows, with the invention of this goddess.\" Billson points out that the [[Christianization]] of England started at the end of the 6th century, and, by the 7th, was completed. Billson argues that, as Bede was born in 672, Bede must have had opportunities to learn the names of the native goddesses of the Anglo-Saxons, \"who were hardly extinct in his lifetime.\"<ref name=\"BILLSON448\">Billson (1892:448).</ref>\n\nWriting in the late 20th century, [[Rudolf Simek]] says that, despite expressions of doubts, Bede's account of {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} should not be disregarded. Simek opines that a \"Spring-like fertility goddess\" must be assumed rather than a \"goddess of sunrise\" regardless of the name, reasoning that \"otherwise the Germanic goddesses (and [[matres and Matronae|matrons]]) are mostly connected with prosperity and growth\". Simek points to a comparison with the goddess [[Rheda (mythology)|Rheda]], also attested by Bede.<ref name=\"SIMEK74\">Simek (2007:74).</ref>\n\nScholar Philip A. Shaw (2011) writes that the subject has seen \"a lengthy history of arguments for and against Bede's goddess {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}, with some scholars taking fairly extreme positions on either side\" and that some theories against the goddess have gained popular cultural prominence. Shaw, however, notes that \"much of this debate, however, was conducted in ignorance of a key piece of evidence, as it was not discovered until 1958. This evidence is furnished by over 150 Romano-Germanic votive inscriptions to deities named the {{lang|la|matronae Austriahenae}}, found near Morken-Harff and datable to around 150\u2013250 AD\". Most of these inscriptions are in an incomplete state, yet most are in a complete enough for reasonable clarity of the inscriptions. As early as 1966 scholars have linked these names etymologically with {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} and an element found in Germanic personal names.<ref name=\"SHAW52\">Shaw (2011:52).</ref> Shaw argues against a functional interpretation of the available evidence and concludes that \"the etymological connections of her name suggests that her worshippers saw her geographical and social relationship with them as more central than any functions she may have had\".<ref name=\"SHAW70-71\">Shaw (2011:70\u201471).</ref>\n\nFolklorist Stephen Winick (2016) disagrees that the existence of the Austriahenae could be used as evidence for the belief in a goddess named Eostre.<ref name=Winick2016>Winick, Stephen.

Accessed 8 May 2019 at https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2016/04/ostara-and-the-hare/</ref>\n\n==Theories and interpretations==\n===Jacob Grimm===\nIn his 1835 {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]|italic=yes}}, [[Jacob Grimm]] cites comparative evidence to reconstruct a potential [[continental Germanic mythology|continental Germanic goddess]] whose name would have been preserved in the [[Old High German]] name of Easter, *{{lang|goh|Ostara}}. Addressing skepticism towards goddesses mentioned by Bede, Grimm comments that \"there is nothing improbable in them, nay the first of them is justified by clear traces in the vocabularies of Germanic tribes.\"<ref name=GRIMM289>Grimm (1882:289).</ref> Specifically regarding {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}, Grimm continues that:\n<blockquote>\nWe Germans to this day call April {{lang|gmh|ostermonat}}, and {{lang|goh|\u00f4starm\u00e2noth}} is found as early as [[Einhard|Eginhart]] ({{lang|la|temp. [[Vita Karoli Magni|Car. Mag.]]}}). The great Christian festival, which usually falls in April or the end of March, bears in the oldest of OHG remains the name {{lang|goh|\u00f4star\u00e2}} ... it is mostly found in the plural, because two days ... were kept at Easter. This {{lang|goh|Ostar\u00e2|italic=yes}}, like the [Anglo-Saxon] {{lang|ang|E\u00e1stre}}, must in heathen religion have denoted a higher being, whose worship was so firmly rooted, that the Christian teachers tolerated the name, and applied it to one of their own grandest anniversaries.<ref name=\"GRIMM290\">Grimm (1882:290).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nGrimm notes that \"all of the nations bordering on us have retained the Biblical {{lang|la|pascha}}; even [[Ulfilas|Ulphilas]] writes {{lang|got|\ud800\udf40\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3a\ud800\udf30}}, not {{lang|got|\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf44\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf49}} ({{lang|got-Latn|paska}} not {{lang|got-Latn|\u00e1ustr\u00f4}}), though he must have known the word\". Grimm details that the Old High German adverb {{lang|goh|\u00f4star}} \"expresses movement towards the rising sun\", as did the [[Old Norse]] term {{lang|non|austr}}, and potentially also Anglo-Saxon {{lang|ang|\u0113astor}} and Gothic {{lang|got|[[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf44\ud800\udf42}} ({{lang|got-Latn|[[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]\u00e1ustr}}). Grimm compares these terms to the identical Latin term {{lang|la|auster}}. Grimm says that the cult of the goddess may have worshiped an Old Norse form, {{lang|non|Austra}}, or that her cult may have already been extinct by the time of Christianization.<ref name=GRIMM290-291>Grimm (1882:290\u2014291).</ref>\n\nGrimm notes that the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book {{lang|non|[[Gylfaginning]]|italic=yes}} attests to a male being called {{lang|non|[[Nor\u00f0ri, Su\u00f0ri, Austri and Vestri|Austri]]}}, whom Grimm describes as a \"spirit of light.\" Grimm comments that a female version would have been {{lang|gem-x-proto|Austra}}, yet that the High German and Saxon peoples seem to have only formed {{lang|goh|Ostar\u00e2}} and {{lang|osx|E\u00e1stre}}, feminine, and not {{lang|goh|Ostaro}} and {{lang|osx|E\u00e1stra}}, masculine. Grimm additionally speculates on the nature of the goddess and surviving folk customs that may have been associated with her in Germany:\n<blockquote>\n{{lang|goh|Ostara}}, {{lang|osx|E\u00e1stre}} seems therefore to have been the divinity of the radiant dawn, of upspringing light, a spectacle that brings joy and blessing, whose meaning could be easily adapted by the resurrection-day of the Christian's God. ''Bonfires'' were lighted at Easter and according to popular belief of long standing, the moment the sun rises on Easter Sunday morning, he gives ''three joyful leaps'', he dances for joy ... Water drawn on the Easter morning is, like that at Christmas, holy and healing ... here also heathen notions seems to have grafted themselves on great Christian festivals. Maidens clothed in white, who at Easter, at the season of returning spring, show themselves in clefts of the rock and on mountains, are suggestive of the ancient goddess.<ref name=\"GRIMM291\">Grimm (1882:291).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the second volume of {{lang|de|Deutsche Mythologie}}, Grimm picked up the subject of Ostara again, speculating on possible connections between the goddess and various German Easter customs, including Easter eggs:\n<blockquote>\nBut if we admit, goddesses, then, in addition to [[Nerthus]], {{lang|goh|Ostara}} has the strongest claim to consideration. To what we said on p.&thinsp;290 I can add some significant facts. The heathen Easter had much in common with May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in the matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people ''Easter-games'' so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate&thinsp;: I allude especially to the custom of ''Easter eggs'', and to the ''Easter tale'' which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.<ref name=\"GRIMM780-781\">Grimm (1883:780\u2013781).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nGrimm commented on further Easter time customs, including unique sword dances and particular baked goods (\"pastry of heathenish form\"). In addition, Grimm weighed a potential connection to the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] spring goddess {{lang|sla|[[Vesna]]}} and the Lithuanian {{lang|lt|[[Vasara (mythology)|Vasara]]}}.<ref name=\"GRIMM780-781\"/>\n\nAccording to anthropologist Krystal D'Costa, there is no evidence to connect the tradition of Easter eggs with Ostara. Eggs became a symbol in Christianity associated with rebirth as early as the 1st century AD, via the iconography of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] egg. D'Costa theorizes that eggs became associated with Easter specifically in medieval Europe, when eating them was prohibited during the fast of [[Lent]]. D'Costa highlights that a common practice in England at that time was for children to go door-to-door begging for eggs on the Saturday before Lent began. People handed out eggs as special treats for children prior to their fast.<ref name=\"D'Costa\"/>\n\n===Connection to Easter Hares===\n[[File:Easter Bunny Postcard 1907.jpg|thumb|An Easter postcard from 1907 depicting a rabbit]]\nIn Northern Europe, Easter imagery often involves [[easter Bunny|hares and rabbits]]. The first scholar to make a connection between the goddess Eostre and hares was Adolf Holtzmann in his book ''Deutsche Mythologie''. Holtzmann wrote of the tradition, \"the Easter Hare is inexplicable to me, but probably the hare was the sacred animal of Ostara; just as there is a hare on the statue of [[Abnoba]].\" Citing folk [[Easter customs]] in [[Leicestershire]], England where \"the profits of the land called Harecrop Leys were applied to providing a meal which was thrown on the ground at the 'Hare-pie Bank'\", late 19th-century scholar [[Charles Isaac Elton]] speculated on a connection between these customs and the worship of {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Elton, Charles Isaac |authorlink=Charles Isaac Elton |title=Origins of English History |date=1882 |page=391 |url=https://archive.org/stream/originsofenglis00elto#page/390/mode/2up/search/harecrop}}</ref> In his late 19th-century study of the hare in folk custom and mythology, Charles J. Billson cited numerous incidents of folk customs involving hares around the Easter season in Northern Europe. Billson said that \"whether there was a goddess named {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}, or not, and whatever connection the hare may have had with the ritual of Saxon or British worship, there are good grounds for believing that the sacredness of this animal reaches back into an age still more remote, where it is probably a very important part of the great Spring Festival of the prehistoric inhabitants of this island.\"<ref name=\"BILLSON448\">Billson (1892:448).</ref>\n\nAdolf Holtzmann had also speculated that \"the hare must once have been a bird, because it lays eggs\" in modern German folklore. From this statement, numerous later sources built a modern legend in which the goddess Eostre transformed a bird into an egg-laying hare.<ref name=Winick2016/> A response to a question about the origins of Easter hares in the 8 June 1889 issue of the journal ''American Notes and Queries'' stated: \"In Germany and among the Pennsylvania Germans toy rabbits or hares made of canton flannel stuffed with cotton are given as gifts on Easter morning. The children are told that this Osh\u2019ter has laid the Easter eggs. This curious idea is thus explained: The hare was originally a bird, and was changed into a quadruped by the goddess Ostara; in gratitude to Ostara or Eastre, the hare exercises its original bird function to lay eggs for the goddess on her festal day.\"<ref>''American Notes and Queries'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=-g48AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA64&ots=l0_sPgX_SR&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false June 8, 1889, pp. 64-65].</ref> According to folklorist Stephen Winick, by 1900, many popular sources had picked up the story of Eostre and the hare. One described the story as one of the oldest in mythology, \"despite the fact that it was then less than twenty years old.\"<ref name=Winick2016/>\n\nSome scholars have further linked customs and imagery involving hares to both {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} and the Norse goddess {{lang|non|[[Freyja]]|italic=no}}. Writing in 1972, John Andrew Boyle cited commentary contained within an etymology dictionary by A. Ernout and [[Antoine Meillet|A. Meillet]], where the authors write that \"Little else ... is known about [{{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}], but it has been suggested that her lights, as goddess of the dawn, were carried by hares. And she certainly represented spring [[fecundity]], and love and carnal pleasure that leads to fecundity.\" Boyle responded that nothing is known about {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} outside of Bede's single passage, that the authors had seemingly accepted the identification of {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} with the Norse goddess {{lang|non|Freyja|italic=no}}, yet that the hare is not associated with {{lang|non|Freyja|italic=no}} either. Boyle writes that \"her carriage, we are told by [[Snorri Sturluson|Snorri]], was drawn by a pair of cats \u2014 animals, it is true, which like hares were the familiars of witches, with whom {{lang|non|Freyja|italic=no}} seems to have much in common.\" However, Boyle adds that \"on the other hand, when the authors speak of the hare as the 'companion of [[Aphrodite]] and of [[satyr]]s and [[cupid]]s' and point out that 'in the [[Middle Ages]] it appears beside the figure of [[Luxuria (mythology)|Luxuria]]', they are on much surer ground and can adduce the evidence of their illustrations.\"<ref name=\"BOYLE323-324\">Boyle (1972:323\u2014324).</ref>\n\n==In modern culture==\nThe concept of *{{lang|goh|Ostara}} as reconstructed by Jacob Grimm and Adolf Holtzmann has had a strong influence on European culture since the 19th century, with many fanciful legends and associations growing up around the figure of the goddess in popular articles based on the speculation of these early folklorists.<ref name=Winick2016/>\n\nA holiday named for the goddess is part of the modern [[Wicca]]n [[Wheel of the Year]] (Ostara, 21 March).<ref name=\"HUBBARD175\">Hubbard (2007:175).</ref> In some forms of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic neopaganism]], {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} (or Ostara) is venerated. Regarding this veneration, Carole M. Cusack comments that, among adherents, {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} is \"associated with the coming of spring and the dawn, and her festival is celebrated at the [[march equinox|spring equinox]]. Because she brings renewal, rebirth from the death of winter, some Heathens associate {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} with {{lang|non|[[I\u00f0unn]]|italic=no}}, keeper of the apples of youth in [[Norse mythology|Scandinavian mythology]]\".<ref name=\"CUSACK354-355\">Cusack (2008:354\u2013355).</ref>\n\nThe name has been adopted for an [[asteroid]] ([[343 Ostara]], 1892 by [[Max Wolf]]),<ref name=\"SCHMADEL44\">Schmadel (2003:44)</ref> In music, the name {{lang|goh|Ostara}} has been adopted as a name by the musical group [[Ostara (band)|Ostara]],<ref name=\"DIESEL-GERTEN136\">Diesel, Gerten (2007:136).</ref> and as the names of albums by [[Zoviet France|:zoviet*france:]] (''Eostre'', 1984) and [[The Wishing Tree (band)|The Wishing Tree]] (''[[Ostara (album)|Ostara]]'', 2009).\n\nPolitically, the name of Ostara was in the early 20th century invoked as the name of a [[Pan-Germanism|German nationalist]] [[Ostara (magazine)|magazine]], book series and publishing house established in 1905 at {{lang|de|[[M\u00f6dling]]||italic=no}}, [[Austria]].<ref name=\"SIMEK255\">Simek (2007:255).</ref>\n\nOstara is portrayed by [[Kristin Chenoweth]] in the TV series ''[[American Gods (TV series)|American Gods]]'' based on the [[American Gods|novel of the same name]]. In the series, Ostara has survived into the modern age by forming an alliance with the Goddess of Media ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and capitalising on the Christian holiday. Odin ([[Ian McShane]]) forces her to accept that those who celebrate Easter are worshipping Jesus and not her, causing her to join his rebellion against the New Gods.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Griffiths |first1=Eleanor Blye |title=''American Gods'' mythology guide: Meet Germanic spring goddess Ostara |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-06-19/american-gods-mythology-guide-meet-germanic-spring-goddess-ostara |accessdate=21 June 2017 |work=[[Radio Times]] |date=19 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1853, Scottish protestant minister [[Alexander Hislop]] published ''[[The Two Babylons]]'', an anti-Catholic tract.

Particularly prior to the discovery of the ''{{lang|la|matronae Austriahenae}}'' and further developments in [[Indo-European studies]], debate has occurred among some scholars about whether or not the goddess was an invention of Bede. \u0112ostre and Ostara are sometimes referenced in modern popular culture and are venerated in some forms of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic neopaganism]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre}} continues into modern English as ''Easter'' and derives from [[Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/Austr\u01ed|Austr\u01ed]]}}, itself a descendant of the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2082ews-|h\u2082ews-]]}}'', meaning 'to shine' (modern English ''east'' also derives from this root).<ref name=\"WATKINS-2021\">Watkins 2006 [2000]: 2021.</ref>\n\nThe goddess name {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre}} is therefore linguistically [[cognate]] with numerous other dawn goddesses attested among Indo-European language-speaking peoples. These cognates lead to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess; the ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]'' details that \"a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn is supported both by the evidence of cognate names and the similarity of mythic representation of the dawn goddess among various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] groups\u201d and that \u201call of this evidence permits us to posit a Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|[[hausos|h<sub>a</sub>\u00e9us\u014ds]]}}'' 'goddess of dawn' who was characterized as a \"reluctant\" bringer of light for which she is punished. In three of the Indo-European stocks, [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], the existence of a Proto-Indo-European 'goddess of the dawn' is given additional linguistic support in that she is designated the 'daughter of heaven'.\"<ref name=\"EOIEC\">Mallory & Adams (1997:148\u2013149).</ref>\n\n===Related names===\nBy way of [[linguistic reconstruction]], the matter of a goddess called {{lang|gem-x-proto|Austr\u014d}} in the [[Proto-Germanic language]] has been examined in detail since the foundation of [[Germanic philology]] in the 19th century by scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] and others.

Some of these inscriptions refer to the {{lang|la|Austriates}}, evidently the name of a social group.<ref name=\"SHAW52-AND-63\">Shaw (2011:52 and 63).</ref>\n\n==Bede's Eostre==\nIn chapter 15 ({{lang|la|De mensibus Anglorum|italic=yes}}, \"The English months\") of his 8th-century work {{lang|la|De temporum ratione|italic=yes}} (\"''[[The Reckoning of Time]]''\"), [[Bede]] describes the indigenous month names of the English people. After describing the worship of the goddess [[Rheda (mythology)|Rheda]] during the Anglo-Saxon month of {{lang|ang|Hr\u0113\u00fe-m\u014dna\u00fe}}, Bede writes about ''{{lang|ang|\u0112osturm\u014dna\u00fe}}'', the month of the goddess \u0112ostre:\n{{Verse translation |lang=la\n|{{lang|ang|Eostur-monath}}, qui nunc Paschalis mensis interpretatur, quondam a Dea illorum qu\u00e6 {{lang|ang|Eostre}} vocabatur, et cui in illo festa celebrabant nomen habuit: a cujus nomine nunc Paschale tempus cognominant, consueto antiqu\u00e6 observationis vocabulo gaudia nov\u00e6 solemnitatis vocantes.<ref name=\"GILES179\">Giles (1843:179).</ref>\n|{{lang|ang|Eosturmonath}} has a name which is now translated \"Paschal month\", and which was once called after a goddess of theirs named {{lang|ang|Eostre}}, in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month. Now they designate that Paschal season by her name, calling the joys of the new rite by the time-honoured name of the old observance.<ref name=\"WALLIS54\">Wallis (1999:54).</ref>}}\n\nSome debate has occurred over whether or not the goddess was an invention of Bede's. Writing in the late 19th century, [[Charles J. Billson]] notes that scholars before his writing were divided about the existence of Bede's account of \u0112ostre, stating that \"among authorities who have no doubt as to her existence are [[Wilhelm Grimm|W. Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Wackernagel|Wackernagel]], [[Karl Joseph Simrock|Sinrock]] {{sic}}, and Wolf. On the other hand, Weinhold rejects the idea on philological grounds, and so do Heinrich Leo and Hermann Oesre. Kuhn says, 'The Anglo-Saxon {{lang|ang|Eostre|italic=no}} looks like an invention of Bede;' and [[Wilhelm Mannhardt|Mannhardt]] also dismisses her as an etymological {{lang|la|[[deus ex machina|dea ex machina]]}}.\" Billson says that \"the whole question turns ... upon Bede's credibility\", and that \"one is inclined to agree with Grimm, that it would be uncritical to saddle this eminent Father of the Church, who keeps Heathendom at arms' length and tells us less of than he knows, with the invention of this goddess.\" Billson points out that the [[Christianization]] of England started at the end of the 6th century, and, by the 7th, was completed. Billson argues that, as Bede was born in 672, Bede must have had opportunities to learn the names of the native goddesses of the Anglo-Saxons, \"who were hardly extinct in his lifetime.\"<ref name=\"BILLSON448\">Billson (1892:448).</ref>\n\nWriting in the late 20th century, [[Rudolf Simek]] says that, despite expressions of doubts, Bede's account of {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} should not be disregarded. Simek opines that a \"Spring-like fertility goddess\" must be assumed rather than a \"goddess of sunrise\" regardless of the name, reasoning that \"otherwise the Germanic goddesses (and [[matres and Matronae|matrons]]) are mostly connected with prosperity and growth\". Simek points to a comparison with the goddess [[Rheda (mythology)|Rheda]], also attested by Bede.<ref name=\"SIMEK74\">Simek (2007:74).</ref>\n\nScholar Philip A. Shaw (2011) writes that the subject has seen \"a lengthy history of arguments for and against Bede's goddess {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}, with some scholars taking fairly extreme positions on either side\" and that some theories against the goddess have gained popular cultural prominence. Shaw, however, notes that \"much of this debate, however, was conducted in ignorance of a key piece of evidence, as it was not discovered until 1958. This evidence is furnished by over 150 Romano-Germanic votive inscriptions to deities named the {{lang|la|matronae Austriahenae}}, found near Morken-Harff and datable to around 150\u2013250 AD\". Most of these inscriptions are in an incomplete state, yet most are in a complete enough for reasonable clarity of the inscriptions. As early as 1966 scholars have linked these names etymologically with {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} and an element found in Germanic personal names.<ref name=\"SHAW52\">Shaw (2011:52).</ref> Shaw argues against a functional interpretation of the available evidence and concludes that \"the etymological connections of her name suggests that her worshippers saw her geographical and social relationship with them as more central than any functions she may have had\".<ref name=\"SHAW70-71\">Shaw (2011:70\u201471).</ref>\n\nFolklorist Stephen Winick (2016) disagrees that the existence of the Austriahenae could be used as evidence for the belief in a goddess named Eostre.<ref name=Winick2016>Winick, Stephen.

Addressing skepticism towards goddesses mentioned by Bede, Grimm comments that \"there is nothing improbable in them, nay the first of them is justified by clear traces in the vocabularies of Germanic tribes.\"<ref name=GRIMM289>Grimm (1882:289).</ref> Specifically regarding {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}, Grimm continues that:\n<blockquote>\nWe Germans to this day call April {{lang|gmh|ostermonat}}, and {{lang|goh|\u00f4starm\u00e2noth}} is found as early as [[Einhard|Eginhart]] ({{lang|la|temp. [[Vita Karoli Magni|Car. Mag.]]}}). The great Christian festival, which usually falls in April or the end of March, bears in the oldest of OHG remains the name {{lang|goh|\u00f4star\u00e2}} ... it is mostly found in the plural, because two days ... were kept at Easter. This {{lang|goh|Ostar\u00e2|italic=yes}}, like the [Anglo-Saxon] {{lang|ang|E\u00e1stre}}, must in heathen religion have denoted a higher being, whose worship was so firmly rooted, that the Christian teachers tolerated the name, and applied it to one of their own grandest anniversaries.<ref name=\"GRIMM290\">Grimm (1882:290).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nGrimm notes that \"all of the nations bordering on us have retained the Biblical {{lang|la|pascha}}; even [[Ulfilas|Ulphilas]] writes {{lang|got|\ud800\udf40\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3a\ud800\udf30}}, not {{lang|got|\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf44\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf49}} ({{lang|got-Latn|paska}} not {{lang|got-Latn|\u00e1ustr\u00f4}}), though he must have known the word\". Grimm details that the Old High German adverb {{lang|goh|\u00f4star}} \"expresses movement towards the rising sun\", as did the [[Old Norse]] term {{lang|non|austr}}, and potentially also Anglo-Saxon {{lang|ang|\u0113astor}} and Gothic {{lang|got|[[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf44\ud800\udf42}} ({{lang|got-Latn|[[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]\u00e1ustr}}). Grimm compares these terms to the identical Latin term {{lang|la|auster}}. Grimm says that the cult of the goddess may have worshiped an Old Norse form, {{lang|non|Austra}}, or that her cult may have already been extinct by the time of Christianization.<ref name=GRIMM290-291>Grimm (1882:290\u2014291).</ref>\n\nGrimm notes that the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book {{lang|non|[[Gylfaginning]]|italic=yes}} attests to a male being called {{lang|non|[[Nor\u00f0ri, Su\u00f0ri, Austri and Vestri|Austri]]}}, whom Grimm describes as a \"spirit of light.\" Grimm comments that a female version would have been {{lang|gem-x-proto|Austra}}, yet that the High German and Saxon peoples seem to have only formed {{lang|goh|Ostar\u00e2}} and {{lang|osx|E\u00e1stre}}, feminine, and not {{lang|goh|Ostaro}} and {{lang|osx|E\u00e1stra}}, masculine. Grimm additionally speculates on the nature of the goddess and surviving folk customs that may have been associated with her in Germany:\n<blockquote>\n{{lang|goh|Ostara}}, {{lang|osx|E\u00e1stre}} seems therefore to have been the divinity of the radiant dawn, of upspringing light, a spectacle that brings joy and blessing, whose meaning could be easily adapted by the resurrection-day of the Christian's God. ''Bonfires'' were lighted at Easter and according to popular belief of long standing, the moment the sun rises on Easter Sunday morning, he gives ''three joyful leaps'', he dances for joy ... Water drawn on the Easter morning is, like that at Christmas, holy and healing ... here also heathen notions seems to have grafted themselves on great Christian festivals. Maidens clothed in white, who at Easter, at the season of returning spring, show themselves in clefts of the rock and on mountains, are suggestive of the ancient goddess.<ref name=\"GRIMM291\">Grimm (1882:291).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the second volume of {{lang|de|Deutsche Mythologie}}, Grimm picked up the subject of Ostara again, speculating on possible connections between the goddess and various German Easter customs, including Easter eggs:\n<blockquote>\nBut if we admit, goddesses, then, in addition to [[Nerthus]], {{lang|goh|Ostara}} has the strongest claim to consideration. To what we said on p.&thinsp;290 I can add some significant facts. The heathen Easter had much in common with May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in the matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people ''Easter-games'' so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate&thinsp;: I allude especially to the custom of ''Easter eggs'', and to the ''Easter tale'' which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.<ref name=\"GRIMM780-781\">Grimm (1883:780\u2013781).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nGrimm commented on further Easter time customs, including unique sword dances and particular baked goods (\"pastry of heathenish form\"). In addition, Grimm weighed a potential connection to the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] spring goddess {{lang|sla|[[Vesna]]}} and the Lithuanian {{lang|lt|[[Vasara (mythology)|Vasara]]}}.<ref name=\"GRIMM780-781\"/>\n\nAccording to anthropologist Krystal D'Costa, there is no evidence to connect the tradition of Easter eggs with Ostara. Eggs became a symbol in Christianity associated with rebirth as early as the 1st century AD, via the iconography of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] egg. D'Costa theorizes that eggs became associated with Easter specifically in medieval Europe, when eating them was prohibited during the fast of [[Lent]]. D'Costa highlights that a common practice in England at that time was for children to go door-to-door begging for eggs on the Saturday before Lent began. People handed out eggs as special treats for children prior to their fast.<ref name=\"D'Costa\"/>\n\n===Connection to Easter Hares===\n[[File:Easter Bunny Postcard 1907.jpg|thumb|An Easter postcard from 1907 depicting a rabbit]]\nIn Northern Europe, Easter imagery often involves [[easter Bunny|hares and rabbits]]. The first scholar to make a connection between the goddess Eostre and hares was Adolf Holtzmann in his book ''Deutsche Mythologie''. Holtzmann wrote of the tradition, \"the Easter Hare is inexplicable to me, but probably the hare was the sacred animal of Ostara; just as there is a hare on the statue of [[Abnoba]].\" Citing folk [[Easter customs]] in [[Leicestershire]], England where \"the profits of the land called Harecrop Leys were applied to providing a meal which was thrown on the ground at the 'Hare-pie Bank'\", late 19th-century scholar [[Charles Isaac Elton]] speculated on a connection between these customs and the worship of {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Elton, Charles Isaac |authorlink=Charles Isaac Elton |title=Origins of English History |date=1882 |page=391 |url=https://archive.org/stream/originsofenglis00elto#page/390/mode/2up/search/harecrop}}</ref> In his late 19th-century study of the hare in folk custom and mythology, Charles J. Billson cited numerous incidents of folk customs involving hares around the Easter season in Northern Europe. Billson said that \"whether there was a goddess named {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}, or not, and whatever connection the hare may have had with the ritual of Saxon or British worship, there are good grounds for believing that the sacredness of this animal reaches back into an age still more remote, where it is probably a very important part of the great Spring Festival of the prehistoric inhabitants of this island.\"<ref name=\"BILLSON448\">Billson (1892:448).</ref>\n\nAdolf Holtzmann had also speculated that \"the hare must once have been a bird, because it lays eggs\" in modern German folklore. From this statement, numerous later sources built a modern legend in which the goddess Eostre transformed a bird into an egg-laying hare.<ref name=Winick2016/> A response to a question about the origins of Easter hares in the 8 June 1889 issue of the journal ''American Notes and Queries'' stated: \"In Germany and among the Pennsylvania Germans toy rabbits or hares made of canton flannel stuffed with cotton are given as gifts on Easter morning. The children are told that this Osh\u2019ter has laid the Easter eggs. This curious idea is thus explained: The hare was originally a bird, and was changed into a quadruped by the goddess Ostara; in gratitude to Ostara or Eastre, the hare exercises its original bird function to lay eggs for the goddess on her festal day.\"<ref>''American Notes and Queries'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=-g48AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA64&ots=l0_sPgX_SR&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false June 8, 1889, pp. 64-65].</ref> According to folklorist Stephen Winick, by 1900, many popular sources had picked up the story of Eostre and the hare. One described the story as one of the oldest in mythology, \"despite the fact that it was then less than twenty years old.\"<ref name=Winick2016/>\n\nSome scholars have further linked customs and imagery involving hares to both {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} and the Norse goddess {{lang|non|[[Freyja]]|italic=no}}. Writing in 1972, John Andrew Boyle cited commentary contained within an etymology dictionary by A. Ernout and [[Antoine Meillet|A. Meillet]], where the authors write that \"Little else ... is known about [{{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}}], but it has been suggested that her lights, as goddess of the dawn, were carried by hares. And she certainly represented spring [[fecundity]], and love and carnal pleasure that leads to fecundity.\" Boyle responded that nothing is known about {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} outside of Bede's single passage, that the authors had seemingly accepted the identification of {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} with the Norse goddess {{lang|non|Freyja|italic=no}}, yet that the hare is not associated with {{lang|non|Freyja|italic=no}} either. Boyle writes that \"her carriage, we are told by [[Snorri Sturluson|Snorri]], was drawn by a pair of cats \u2014 animals, it is true, which like hares were the familiars of witches, with whom {{lang|non|Freyja|italic=no}} seems to have much in common.\" However, Boyle adds that \"on the other hand, when the authors speak of the hare as the 'companion of [[Aphrodite]] and of [[satyr]]s and [[cupid]]s' and point out that 'in the [[Middle Ages]] it appears beside the figure of [[Luxuria (mythology)|Luxuria]]', they are on much surer ground and can adduce the evidence of their illustrations.\"<ref name=\"BOYLE323-324\">Boyle (1972:323\u2014324).</ref>\n\n==In modern culture==\nThe concept of *{{lang|goh|Ostara}} as reconstructed by Jacob Grimm and Adolf Holtzmann has had a strong influence on European culture since the 19th century, with many fanciful legends and associations growing up around the figure of the goddess in popular articles based on the speculation of these early folklorists.<ref name=Winick2016/>\n\nA holiday named for the goddess is part of the modern [[Wicca]]n [[Wheel of the Year]] (Ostara, 21 March).<ref name=\"HUBBARD175\">Hubbard (2007:175).</ref> In some forms of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic neopaganism]], {{lang|ang|\u0112ostre|italic=no}} (or Ostara) is venerated.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 93 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.
