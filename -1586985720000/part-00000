When he comes to, Kristen emerges and reveals to him that she has been keeping tabs on Brady, including his relationship with [[Theresa Donovan]] ([[Jen Lilley]]) and his father's coma. After Daniel refuses to cooperate in her plan to get Brady to St. Louis, Kristen tortures him to get him to agree to take part. Without her present, Daniel manages to untie his restraints and knocks one of Kristen's henchmen unconscious. Upon her return, Daniel manages to take Kristen captive; rendering her his own hostage. He then hides her in the hotel supply closet and ties her up. Later, Daniel takes her back to Salem where she is arrested. EJ refuses to be Kristen's lawyer because of what she did to Sami's brother Eric. Kristen is charged with an array of different counts, including assault, battery, rape and the use of restricted pharmaceuticals. After she pleads not guilty to the charges, Kristen is released on bail and is forced to wear a tracking device.  In an attempt to win back Brady, Kristen gives Daniel and [[Kayla Brady]] ([[Mary Beth Evans]]) part of a formula for a miracle drug that could possibly awaken John from his coma. In exchange for the full formula, Kristen tells Marlena that she will need to talk Eric out of testifying against her in court. Both Marlena and Eric agree to Kristen's terms, resulting in charges being dropped, and Daniel and Kayla receiving the full formula for the miracle drug.\n\nWhen John begins to show some response to the drug, Kristen attempts to use the news as leverage to mend her relationship with Brady. Kristen also butts heads with Theresa, and begins to suspect that she was the one to put John into his coma, and not Brady, as originally believed. When John backs the theory that it was Brady who hit him with the poker, Kristen makes it her ultimate mission to prove Theresa's guilt. Kristen [[Covert listening device|bugs]] both Theresa's sister, Eve Donovan ([[Kassie DePaiva]]) and her co-worker Anne Milbauer ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]), in the hopes of catching Theresa in her lie. When she achieves her goal, Kristen presents the audio recording to Brady, who accuses her of tampering with the audio for her own personal gain. In her grief, Kristen turns to Daniel for solace, resulting in the two ending up in bed together. When Brady arrives at Daniel's apartment to make amends, he discovers both Daniel and Kristen in the throes of passion. In the absence of Brady, Kristen and Daniel stop short of having sex, both agreeing that it would be wrong. Brady later confronts Kristen at her hotel room. While he admits that she was telling the truth about Theresa's wrongdoing, he's furious at what she did with Daniel. and makes it known that there is no hope of reconciliation between the two of them. An enraged Kristen heads to the park to calm down, only to overhear Theresa revealing to Anne that she's pregnant with Brady's baby. Kristen, in an act of revenge, orders for Theresa to be kidnapped. Kristen makes one final phone call to Brady letting him know that as she leaves Salem, she's going to be carrying a part of him inside of her. An unknown procedure is prepared for Kristen and an unconscious Theresa by doctors.\n\nKristen, who is living in Italy, gives birth to Theresa and Brady's baby. The baby, named Christopher, is born with an autoimmune deficiency and requires a bone marrow transplant. Kristen orders that Brady and Theresa's blood be drawn in order to find a suitable donor. [[Melanie Jonas|Melanie]] ([[Molly Burnett]]) begins investigating and eventually fits the clues together and reveals to Brady that Theresa was pregnant, he is the father, and that Kristen has stolen the baby. Kristen is informed that Theresa is a suitable match for the baby and orders her henchman, Clint (Lucas Kerr) to bring her to her. Brady sets out to find Kristen. He gets her location from Victor. Despite his objections, Melanie decides to stowaway on Brady's private plane, providing backup in his confrontation with Kristen. When Brady confronts Kristen with the allegation that she's stolen his child, she vehemently denies it. Brady searches the castle and leaves empty handed. Melanie sneaks into the castle and finds the baby in a secret room. Kristen catches Melanie and uses her to lure Brady back to the castle. Kristen presents the baby as Daniel Jonas'. Unsure if Kristen is telling the truth, Brady demands a paternity and maternity test. Kristen takes Brady and Melanie captive. Thinking that she's being taken on a luxury vacation, Theresa arrives at the castle with Clint. Kristen drugs Theresa and has her taken to the baby's room for the bone marrow procedure. Kristen gives Brady one last look at his child and leaves him with Melanie to be executed. Kristen goes to leave the castle with the baby and finds Marlena, who accidentally grabbed hold of the wrong address to find [[Paul Narita|Paul]] ([[Christopher Sean]]) and John, at her doorstep. Melanie and Brady manage to subdue and kill Clint. Theresa overpowers Dr. Mandrake. Marlena senses that Kristen is up to no good and is determined to find out what she's hiding. Kristen pulls out a gun and the two end up fighting for it. Brady barges in and Kristen, now distracted, is catapulted by Marlena through a glass window several feet above a bay. Despite a body not being found, Kristen is presumed dead by Brady, the Italian police and the entire citizens of Salem.\n\n=== 2017\u2013present ===\nIn November 2017, Kristen appears in Memphis, Tennessee still alive. She secretly slips into [[Will Horton]]'s bedroom at Susan's home. Laughing to herself, she taunts the thought of Susan tricking Will into believing he was EJ, when she could have had the real EJ the entire time. Months later, Kristen ([[Stacy Haiduk]]) returns to Salem \u2014 disguised as Susan \u2014 and turns up for John and Marlena's wedding. A drugged and barely coherent Sami exposes Kristen's true identity at the ceremony. Kristen gives Sami a gun, and offers to tell her the whereabouts of EJ, provided she shoots John. Eric rushes for the gun, causing it to fire, leaving Marlena critically wounded. It was later revealed that Marlena was shot by another gun. Kristen lures Brady to a hotel room only to be tracked down by [[Eve Donovan|Eve]] ([[Kassie DePaiva]]), Sami, and Paul. A fight breaks out between Kristen and Paul. The pair end up crashing through a window resulting in Paul confined to a wheelchair and Kristen on the run. Kristen turns to her brother Stefan ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]) for help. Stefan hides her in the tunnels located beneath the DiMera mansion. Kristen visits Marlena in the hospital intending to end her life once and for all. She quickly discovers it's Hattie Adams (Deidre Hall) and not Marlena in the hospital room. Kristen convinces Brady to run away with her and the two head to Nashville where she's been running a secret facility for Dr. Rolf (William Utay) to conduct his experiments of bringing the dead back to life.  When a fire breaks out at the Nashville facility, Kristen decides to stay behind. One of the patients, EJ DiMera, is rescued by Sami. A firefighter reports that no survivors were found.\n\nKristen, alive and well, returns to Salem donning a mask, disguising herself as [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]). She is helped, once again, by [[Xander Kiriakis]] ([[Paul Telfer (actor)|Paul Telfer]]) in carrying out her plan, which involves trying to seduce Brady while also using Nicole's identity to manipulate Stefan into giving her a place in the family business. Kristen talks her brother Tony, who is alive and still in love with his former wife [[Anna DiMera|Anna]] ([[Leann Hunley]]), into marrying her as Nicole in a scheme to take back DiMera Enterprises from Stefan ([[Brandon Barash]]) and [[Gabi Hernandez]] ([[Camila Banus]]). Her scheme and true identity is exposed at John and Marlena's wedding anniversary celebration. While in custody, Kristen admits to Brady that Nicole and her daughter Holly are alive. After making a deal with the D.A., Kristen is set free. She once again sets her sights on getting back with Brady. Kristen discovers that [[Sarah Horton]] ([[Linsey Godfrey]]) is pregnant and has decided to have an abortion. With the assistance of Dr. Rolf and Xander, she decides to steal Sarah's embryo and implant it in herself, in an attempt to pass the baby off as her own with Brady. Rolf informs Kristen that she is already pregnant after sleeping with Brady while impersonating Nicole, thus making the procedure on Sarah both unnecessary and impossible. Kristen and Brady are led to believe that their newborn baby daughter, Rachel Isabella, named after Kristen's mother, Rachel Blake, and Brady's mother, [[Isabella Toscano]], died after birth when in reality the baby was switched at birth by Xander under orders from his uncle, Victor to spare the knowledge that his wife [[Maggie Horton]] is responsible for the deaths of both [[Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis|Adrienne Johnson]] and her own granddaughter, Mackenzie; Rachel is being raised as Mackenzie Horton.

When he comes to, Kristen emerges and reveals to him that she has been keeping tabs on Brady, including his relationship with [[Theresa Donovan]] ([[Jen Lilley]]) and his father's coma. After Daniel refuses to cooperate in her plan to get Brady to St. Louis, Kristen tortures him to get him to agree to take part. Without her present, Daniel manages to untie his restraints and knocks one of Kristen's henchmen unconscious. Upon her return, Daniel manages to take Kristen captive; rendering her his own hostage. He then hides her in the hotel supply closet and ties her up. Later, Daniel takes her back to Salem where she is arrested. EJ refuses to be Kristen's lawyer because of what she did to Sami's brother Eric. Kristen is charged with an array of different counts, including assault, battery, rape and the use of restricted pharmaceuticals. After she pleads not guilty to the charges, Kristen is released on bail and is forced to wear a tracking device.  In an attempt to win back Brady, Kristen gives Daniel and [[Kayla Brady]] ([[Mary Beth Evans]]) part of a formula for a miracle drug that could possibly awaken John from his coma. In exchange for the full formula, Kristen tells Marlena that she will need to talk Eric out of testifying against her in court. Both Marlena and Eric agree to Kristen's terms, resulting in charges being dropped, and Daniel and Kayla receiving the full formula for the miracle drug.\n\nWhen John begins to show some response to the drug, Kristen attempts to use the news as leverage to mend her relationship with Brady. Kristen also butts heads with Theresa, and begins to suspect that she was the one to put John into his coma, and not Brady, as originally believed. When John backs the theory that it was Brady who hit him with the poker, Kristen makes it her ultimate mission to prove Theresa's guilt. Kristen [[Covert listening device|bugs]] both Theresa's sister, Eve Donovan ([[Kassie DePaiva]]) and her co-worker Anne Milbauer ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]), in the hopes of catching Theresa in her lie. When she achieves her goal, Kristen presents the audio recording to Brady, who accuses her of tampering with the audio for her own personal gain. In her grief, Kristen turns to Daniel for solace, resulting in the two ending up in bed together. When Brady arrives at Daniel's apartment to make amends, he discovers both Daniel and Kristen in the throes of passion. In the absence of Brady, Kristen and Daniel stop short of having sex, both agreeing that it would be wrong. Brady later confronts Kristen at her hotel room. While he admits that she was telling the truth about Theresa's wrongdoing, he's furious at what she did with Daniel. and makes it known that there is no hope of reconciliation between the two of them. An enraged Kristen heads to the park to calm down, only to overhear Theresa revealing to Anne that she's pregnant with Brady's baby. Kristen, in an act of revenge, orders for Theresa to be kidnapped. Kristen makes one final phone call to Brady letting him know that as she leaves Salem, she's going to be carrying a part of him inside of her. An unknown procedure is prepared for Kristen and an unconscious Theresa by doctors.\n\nKristen, who is living in Italy, gives birth to Theresa and Brady's baby. The baby, named Christopher, is born with an autoimmune deficiency and requires a bone marrow transplant. Kristen orders that Brady and Theresa's blood be drawn in order to find a suitable donor. [[Melanie Jonas|Melanie]] ([[Molly Burnett]]) begins investigating and eventually fits the clues together and reveals to Brady that Theresa was pregnant, he is the father, and that Kristen has stolen the baby. Kristen is informed that Theresa is a suitable match for the baby and orders her henchman, Clint (Lucas Kerr) to bring her to her. Brady sets out to find Kristen. He gets her location from Victor. Despite his objections, Melanie decides to stowaway on Brady's private plane, providing backup in his confrontation with Kristen. When Brady confronts Kristen with the allegation that she's stolen his child, she vehemently denies it. Brady searches the castle and leaves empty handed. Melanie sneaks into the castle and finds the baby in a secret room. Kristen catches Melanie and uses her to lure Brady back to the castle. Kristen presents the baby as Daniel Jonas'. Unsure if Kristen is telling the truth, Brady demands a paternity and maternity test. Kristen takes Brady and Melanie captive. Thinking that she's being taken on a luxury vacation, Theresa arrives at the castle with Clint. Kristen drugs Theresa and has her taken to the baby's room for the bone marrow procedure. Kristen gives Brady one last look at his child and leaves him with Melanie to be executed. Kristen goes to leave the castle with the baby and finds Marlena, who accidentally grabbed hold of the wrong address to find [[Paul Narita|Paul]] ([[Christopher Sean]]) and John, at her doorstep. Melanie and Brady manage to subdue and kill Clint. Theresa overpowers Dr. Mandrake. Marlena senses that Kristen is up to no good and is determined to find out what she's hiding. Kristen pulls out a gun and the two end up fighting for it. Brady barges in and Kristen, now distracted, is catapulted by Marlena through a glass window several feet above a bay. Despite a body not being found, Kristen is presumed dead by Brady, the Italian police and the entire citizens of Salem.\n\n=== 2017\u2013present ===\nIn November 2017, Kristen appears in Memphis, Tennessee still alive. She secretly slips into [[Will Horton]]'s bedroom at Susan's home. Laughing to herself, she taunts the thought of Susan tricking Will into believing he was EJ, when she could have had the real EJ the entire time. Months later, Kristen ([[Stacy Haiduk]]) returns to Salem \u2014 disguised as Susan \u2014 and turns up for John and Marlena's wedding. A drugged and barely coherent Sami exposes Kristen's true identity at the ceremony. Kristen gives Sami a gun, and offers to tell her the whereabouts of EJ, provided she shoots John. Eric rushes for the gun, causing it to fire, leaving Marlena critically wounded. It was later revealed that Marlena was shot by another gun. Kristen lures Brady to a hotel room only to be tracked down by [[Eve Donovan|Eve]] ([[Kassie DePaiva]]), Sami, and Paul. A fight breaks out between Kristen and Paul. The pair end up crashing through a window resulting in Paul confined to a wheelchair and Kristen on the run. Kristen turns to her brother Stefan ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]) for help. Stefan hides her in the tunnels located beneath the DiMera mansion. Kristen visits Marlena in the hospital intending to end her life once and for all. She quickly discovers it's Hattie Adams (Deidre Hall) and not Marlena in the hospital room. Kristen convinces Brady to run away with her and the two head to Nashville where she's been running a secret facility for Dr. Rolf (William Utay) to conduct his experiments of bringing the dead back to life.  When a fire breaks out at the Nashville facility, Kristen decides to stay behind. One of the patients, EJ DiMera, is rescued by Sami. A firefighter reports that no survivors were found.\n\nKristen, alive and well, returns to Salem donning a mask, disguising herself as [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]). She is helped, once again, by [[Xander Kiriakis]] ([[Paul Telfer (actor)|Paul Telfer]]) in carrying out her plan, which involves trying to seduce Brady while also using Nicole's identity to manipulate Stefan into giving her a place in the family business. Kristen talks her brother Tony, who is alive and still in love with his former wife [[Anna DiMera|Anna]] ([[Leann Hunley]]), into marrying her as Nicole in a scheme to take back DiMera Enterprises from Stefan ([[Brandon Barash]]) and [[Gabi Hernandez]] ([[Camila Banus]]). Her scheme and true identity is exposed at John and Marlena's wedding anniversary celebration. While in custody, Kristen admits to Brady that Nicole and her daughter Holly are alive. After making a deal with the D.A., Kristen is set free. She once again sets her sights on getting back with Brady. Kristen discovers that [[Sarah Horton]] ([[Linsey Godfrey]]) is pregnant and has decided to have an abortion. With the assistance of Dr. Rolf and Xander, she decides to steal Sarah's embryo and implant it in herself, in an attempt to pass the baby off as her own with Brady. Rolf informs Kristen that she is already pregnant after sleeping with Brady while impersonating Nicole, thus making the procedure on Sarah both unnecessary and impossible. Kristen and Brady are led to believe that their newborn baby daughter, Rachel Isabella, named after Kristen's mother, Rachel Blake, and Brady's mother, [[Isabella Toscano]], died after birth when in reality the baby was switched at birth by Xander under orders from his uncle, Victor to spare the knowledge that his wife [[Maggie Horton]] is responsible for the deaths of both [[Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis|Adrienne Johnson]] and her own granddaughter, Mackenzie; Rachel is being raised as Mackenzie Horton. A year later, Kristen is shown living as a nun in the same convent as [[Lani Price]] ([[Sal Stowers]]), who she attempts to help cope with the pain she feels for calling off her wedding. The two return to Salem after an attempt on Kristen's life, and become friends. Kristen is unaware that her baby is alive and has developed cancer and will need a bone marrow transplant from her parents.\n\n== Reception ==\nDavidson has received a number of honors for her portrayal of Kristen, including a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] in 1998, winning the award in 2014.<ref name=\"1998 Nom\">{{cite web|last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |title=ABC tops Emmy noms |url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/abc-tops-emmy-noms-1117468677/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |date=March 11, 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HiBQlK7j?url=http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/abc-tops-emmy-noms-1117468677/ |archivedate=June 28, 2013 |location=Los Angeles, California |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://daytimeconfidential.com/2014/06/22/eileen-davidson-wins-daytime-emmy-outstanding-lead-actress/ |title=Eileen Davidson WINS Daytime Emmy For Outstanding Lead Actress! |last=Bowe |first=Jullian |work=[[Zap2it]] |publisher=Daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com |accessdate=June 22, 2014 |date=June 22, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"NATAS 2014 Wins\">{{cite web|url=http://emmyonline.org/day_41st_winners_stream |title=The 41st Annual Daytime Entertainment Emmy Award Winners |publisher=emmyonline.org and [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |date=June 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QYYZ7l8z?url=http://emmyonline.org/day_41st_winners_stream |archivedate=June 23, 2014 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Davidson also earned [[Soap Opera Digest Award]] nomination for [[Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Daytime Drama|Outstanding Lead Actress]] in 1997 and 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Event: Soap Opera Digest Awards (1997)|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000616/1977|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014|date=February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Event: Soap Opera Digest Awards (1998)|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000616/1998|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014|date=February 27, 2013}}</ref> Kristen's return storyline was also voted the best of 2013 in several soap publications, such as ''Daytime Confidential''.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Return Spring 2015\">All reports discussing the spring 2015 return of [[Eileen Davidson]] to ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'':\n*{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Anthony|title=Eileen Davidson's 'Days Of Our Lives' Return!

His sister [[Kayla Brady]] locates a clinic in California that will accept Caroline as a patient for a trial treatment. Bo leaves town with Caroline and is reported to have returned to Salem a short while later, but is not seen on-screen.\n\nBo leaves Salem to work for the [[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|ISA]] and promises his family he will return, but after many months without hearing from him, Hope begin to doubt Bo is coming back, she meets lawyer [[Aiden Jennings]] in January 2014, and after receiving no word from Bo, heartbrokenly files for divorce, she and Aiden begin a relationship and the two fall madly in love, he asks her to marry him and she accepts, they marry in a ceremony coinciding with the town's bicentennial, on their wedding night, Aiden tries to strangle Hope; a deal he made with [[Stefano DiMera]] to kill Hope and clear Stefano's son, [[Chad DiMera]]'s name after Chad is accused of being responsible for multiple murders around town, Aiden refused to do it until Stefano and Andre threatened to kill his son, Chase if he didn't kill Hope, Bo arrives at the last minute, his absence's reason being he was being held hostage for information in Mexico and Aiden is killed while the two are struggling when a gun Bo was holding goes off, Hope is surprised, yet happy, to see Bo, but is taken to the hospital to make sure she's all right, Hope is later devastated by the news that Bo is dying from an inoperable brain tumor after he confesses his dismal prognosis that he'd been keeping from her shortly after he arrived back in Salem. As they reminisce about their long epic romance, Bo passes away in Hope's arms.\n\nShortly before Bo died, he made a special request, he asked Rafe Hernandez (Hope's longtime work partner) to look after Hope, Rafe reluctantly agreed, after Bo's passing, Rafe kept his word and watched Hope from a distance; remaining her friend and her work partner. When Hope believed that Stefano had a hand in Bo's death, she confronted him which resulted in her shooting and killing him, in the Dimera living room. Hope and Rafe covered up the crime and dumped Stefano's body in an abandoned building set to be blown up. Rafe kicked the body, and they left the building. Andre was later to find the body before it got blown up. Shortly after, Rafe began to develop feelings for one Hope. But those feelings were pushed to the back burner when Chase raped Ciara. Hope was devastated as was Ciara. Hope tried her best to be there for her daughter. Unable to suppress his feelings any further, Rafe kissed Hope, and though Hope was reluctant, and wasn't sure she was ready for a relationship, Rafe assured her she was, and Hope gave in. They started dating. The relationship grew rocky soon after when Aiden turned up.\n\nAs it turned out, he had been replaced by a Dimera doppelg\u00e4nger before the wedding. Aiden lied and told Hope he had been replaced right after he proposed to her. In reality, Aiden had agreed to kill Hope (only because Andre had threatened to kill Aiden's son Chase if Aiden didn't kill Hope). However Aiden decided at the last moment he couldn't do it. He wasn't a killer, and he loved Hope too much. Andre had had his men kidnap Aiden when Aiden had tried to leave, and held him prisoner while the doppelg\u00e4nger went in and tried to kill Hope. It was the doppelg\u00e4nger-not Aiden-whom Bo ended up killing, and who had really tried to kill Hope. Hope struggled with her feelings and eventually, Rafe and Hope decided to part ways. When it came out that Aiden had originally agreed to kill Hope on their wedding night, and had been switched out after they got married and not after he proposed to her like he had said, Hope dumped Aiden. Hope and Rafe reunited immediately after. The two declared their love for one another. Once again, Aiden came between the two and Hope was blackmailed (with her taped admission to murdering Stefano) into breaking it off with Rafe. After going back and forth, the extortion ended after Aiden finally realized what he was doing was wrong, and left town.\n\nUpon Aiden's departure from Salem, Hope believed she was in the clear. But Andre released a copy of Hope's confession, which resulted in Hope being arrested for the murder of the Dimera Patriarch. Hope was sentenced to life in prison much to the dismay of many Salemites. Hope spent months in jail, before it was discovered that Stefano was actually \"Alive and living in Athens\". In reality, it was Shane Donovan in a Stefano mask, but only he and Steve Johnson know it. They did it to get Hope free. Hope was exonerated of all charges and released. Returning to her life, Hope has dealt with Ciara's rebellion, and getting her job back.\n\nIn November 2017, Rafe broke up with Hope because she wasn't ready yet to get married. She begged him not to break up with her, and to listen to her, but he couldn't be with someone who wasn't ready to marry him, so he made her give the ring back, and then slept with Sami the very same night. The next morning, Hope found him in the park and told him she was willing to marry him. He married her on February 26 in a private ceremony at the cabin, promising to always be honest with Hope when in fact, he had never told her the truth about sleeping with Sami. Claire, meanwhile, had overheard Ciara and Trip talking about Rafe cheating with Sami, and Claire announced to Hope in front of everyone at the reception that Rafe cheated. Hope slapped Rafe and ran off. She later told him she wanted an annulment, but eventually, she forgave Rafe enough to hold off on the annulment. They are still trying to work through Rafe's lies and betrayal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams Hernandez ]]\n*[[Supercouple]]\n* Family Hernandez\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/hope.php Hope at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Hope}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist|\n* Kristina Osterhout (1974)\n* Kimberly Weber (1974\u20131975)\n* Natasha Ryan (1975\u20131980)\n* Tammy Taylor (1981\u20131982)\n* [[Kristian Alfonso]] (1983\u2013present)\n* [[Mila Kunis]] (1994 [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]) \n}}\n| first          = {{Start date|1974|01|10|mf=yes}}\n| last           = \n| years          = {{Flat list |\n* 1974\u20131987\n* 1990\n* 1994\u2013present\n}}\n| creator        = [[William J.

Hope is caught and sent to [[Prison|jail]] shortly after this. During her prison time, she uncovers an illegal organ ring and Bo rescues her from prison. Whilst on the run, the two realize their relationship is far from over and Bo ends his relationship with Carly.\n\nIn 2011, Bo and Hope renew their love for each other, on November 11, 2011, while searching through Alice's effects, Hope and her cousin [[Jennifer Horton]] find a clock bearing the symbol of a phoenix, meaning Alice's secrets point to Stefano, during a conversation between Hope and Marlena on December 17, 2012, it is revealed that John and Hope's divorce was finalized, Bo and Hope's problems move to employment, mainly due to budget cuts at the Salem P.D., which meant that they are both asked to take a pay cut, Hope happily agrees, but Bo is very reluctant, after reassuring him that she will support his decision, Bo chooses to leave the police force, during this time, Bo's mother, [[Caroline Brady]] begins to show symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. His sister [[Kayla Brady]] locates a clinic in California that will accept Caroline as a patient for a trial treatment. Bo leaves town with Caroline and is reported to have returned to Salem a short while later, but is not seen on-screen.\n\nBo leaves Salem to work for the [[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|ISA]] and promises his family he will return, but after many months without hearing from him, Hope begin to doubt Bo is coming back, she meets lawyer [[Aiden Jennings]] in January 2014, and after receiving no word from Bo, heartbrokenly files for divorce, she and Aiden begin a relationship and the two fall madly in love, he asks her to marry him and she accepts, they marry in a ceremony coinciding with the town's bicentennial, on their wedding night, Aiden tries to strangle Hope; a deal he made with [[Stefano DiMera]] to kill Hope and clear Stefano's son, [[Chad DiMera]]'s name after Chad is accused of being responsible for multiple murders around town, Aiden refused to do it until Stefano and Andre threatened to kill his son, Chase if he didn't kill Hope, Bo arrives at the last minute, his absence's reason being he was being held hostage for information in Mexico and Aiden is killed while the two are struggling when a gun Bo was holding goes off, Hope is surprised, yet happy, to see Bo, but is taken to the hospital to make sure she's all right, Hope is later devastated by the news that Bo is dying from an inoperable brain tumor after he confesses his dismal prognosis that he'd been keeping from her shortly after he arrived back in Salem. As they reminisce about their long epic romance, Bo passes away in Hope's arms.\n\nShortly before Bo died, he made a special request, he asked Rafe Hernandez (Hope's longtime work partner) to look after Hope, Rafe reluctantly agreed, after Bo's passing, Rafe kept his word and watched Hope from a distance; remaining her friend and her work partner. When Hope believed that Stefano had a hand in Bo's death, she confronted him which resulted in her shooting and killing him, in the Dimera living room. Hope and Rafe covered up the crime and dumped Stefano's body in an abandoned building set to be blown up. Rafe kicked the body, and they left the building. Andre was later to find the body before it got blown up. Shortly after, Rafe began to develop feelings for one Hope. But those feelings were pushed to the back burner when Chase raped Ciara. Hope was devastated as was Ciara. Hope tried her best to be there for her daughter. Unable to suppress his feelings any further, Rafe kissed Hope, and though Hope was reluctant, and wasn't sure she was ready for a relationship, Rafe assured her she was, and Hope gave in. They started dating. The relationship grew rocky soon after when Aiden turned up.\n\nAs it turned out, he had been replaced by a Dimera doppelg\u00e4nger before the wedding. Aiden lied and told Hope he had been replaced right after he proposed to her. In reality, Aiden had agreed to kill Hope (only because Andre had threatened to kill Aiden's son Chase if Aiden didn't kill Hope). However Aiden decided at the last moment he couldn't do it. He wasn't a killer, and he loved Hope too much. Andre had had his men kidnap Aiden when Aiden had tried to leave, and held him prisoner while the doppelg\u00e4nger went in and tried to kill Hope. It was the doppelg\u00e4nger-not Aiden-whom Bo ended up killing, and who had really tried to kill Hope. Hope struggled with her feelings and eventually, Rafe and Hope decided to part ways. When it came out that Aiden had originally agreed to kill Hope on their wedding night, and had been switched out after they got married and not after he proposed to her like he had said, Hope dumped Aiden. Hope and Rafe reunited immediately after. The two declared their love for one another. Once again, Aiden came between the two and Hope was blackmailed (with her taped admission to murdering Stefano) into breaking it off with Rafe. After going back and forth, the extortion ended after Aiden finally realized what he was doing was wrong, and left town.\n\nUpon Aiden's departure from Salem, Hope believed she was in the clear. But Andre released a copy of Hope's confession, which resulted in Hope being arrested for the murder of the Dimera Patriarch. Hope was sentenced to life in prison much to the dismay of many Salemites. Hope spent months in jail, before it was discovered that Stefano was actually \"Alive and living in Athens\". In reality, it was Shane Donovan in a Stefano mask, but only he and Steve Johnson know it. They did it to get Hope free. Hope was exonerated of all charges and released. Returning to her life, Hope has dealt with Ciara's rebellion, and getting her job back.\n\nIn November 2017, Rafe broke up with Hope because she wasn't ready yet to get married. She begged him not to break up with her, and to listen to her, but he couldn't be with someone who wasn't ready to marry him, so he made her give the ring back, and then slept with Sami the very same night. The next morning, Hope found him in the park and told him she was willing to marry him. He married her on February 26 in a private ceremony at the cabin, promising to always be honest with Hope when in fact, he had never told her the truth about sleeping with Sami. Claire, meanwhile, had overheard Ciara and Trip talking about Rafe cheating with Sami, and Claire announced to Hope in front of everyone at the reception that Rafe cheated. Hope slapped Rafe and ran off. She later told him she wanted an annulment, but eventually, she forgave Rafe enough to hold off on the annulment. They are still trying to work through Rafe's lies and betrayal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams Hernandez ]]\n*[[Supercouple]]\n* Family Hernandez\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/hope.php Hope at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Hope}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Salemis a redirect, not an article.
