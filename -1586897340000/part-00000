In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is [[precocial]] and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is [[altricial]] and completely dependent on parenting. In [[marsupial]]s, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short [[gestation]]al period and develops further in its mother's womb's  [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]].\n\nIt is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]], with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], with the [[embryo]] developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals.\n\n==Mammals==\nLarge [[mammal]]s, such as [[primate]]s, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, some [[antelope]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion. In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is [[precocial]]. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.<ref name=Dorit/> In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimizes the risk of drowning.<ref>Mark Simmonds, ''Whales and Dolphins of the World'', New Holland Publishers (2007), Ch. 1, p. 32 {{ISBN|1845378202}}.</ref>  The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humpbackwhale.homestead.com/Humpback-Whale-Calf.html |title=Humpback Whale Calves |author=Crockett, Gary |year=2011 |publisher=Humpback whales Australia |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref>\n\nMost smaller mammals have multiple births, producing litters of young which may number twelve or more.

The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4&nbsp;cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a [[breech birth]]) of the baby is pushed against the [[cervix]], which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10&nbsp;cm diameter.  At some time, the [[amniotic sac]] bursts and the [[amniotic fluid]] escapes (also known as [[rupture of membranes]] or breaking the water).<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.6, ''Normal labour: first stage''</ref> In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the [[vagina]], which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with [[umbilical cord]] attached.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.7, ''Normal labour: second stage''</ref> In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the [[placenta]], amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.8, ''Normal labour: third stage''</ref>\n\nEnormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable [[breathing]] in air. In the uterus, the [[unborn baby]] is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which is a hole in the septum dividing the [[right atrium]] and [[left atrium]]. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the [[right ventricle]] starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the [[left atrium]], which is pumped into the [[left ventricle]], and then pumped into the main arterial system.  As result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The [[umbilical vein]], [[umbilical arteries]], [[ductus venosus]] and [[ductus arteriosus]] are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Human Body Book |page=215 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-8561-3007-3 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |author1=Houston, Rob (editor) |author2=Lea, Maxine (art editor)}}</ref>\n\n===Cattle===\n[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|thumb|alt=Series of photos showing a cow giving birth|A cow giving birth]]\nBirthing in [[cattle]] is typical of a larger mammal. A [[cow]] goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd.  Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the [[uterus]] are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's [[cervix]] gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the [[amniotic sac]] through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf's tail and rear end in a posterior presentation).<ref name=Alberta/>  During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the [[placenta]], which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] cow.<ref name=Alberta>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3451 |title=Calving |date=2000-02-01 |publisher=Alberta: Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref><ref name=ohio>{{cite web |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/vme-fact/pdf/0029.pdf |title=Calving Management in Dairy Herds: Timing of Intervention and Stillbirth|year=2012 |publisher=The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine Extension |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref>\n\n===Dogs===\n{{further|Canine reproduction#Gestation and litters}}\nBirth is termed whelping in dogs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kustritz, M.|year=2005|title=Reproductive behaviour of small animals|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/263302746/Conducta-Reproductiva-en-Pequenos-Animales|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64 |issue=3|pages=734\u2013746|via=|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.022|pmid=15946732}}</ref> Among [[dog]]s, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent.

Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60min intervals.

In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization<ref>Sea World, [http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&-rays/reproduction.htm Sharks & Rays]; accessed 2013.09.09.</ref>). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.<ref name=Attenborough>{{cite book |title=The Trials of Life |last=Attenborough |first=David |year=1990 |isbn=9780002199124 |pages=26\u201330 }}</ref>\n\n[[Ovoviviparity]] is a mode of reproduction in which [[embryo]]s develop inside [[egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain in the mother's body until they are ready to hatch.

The head (or the buttocks in a [[breech birth]]) of the baby is pushed against the [[cervix]], which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10&nbsp;cm diameter.  At some time, the [[amniotic sac]] bursts and the [[amniotic fluid]] escapes (also known as [[rupture of membranes]] or breaking the water).<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.6, ''Normal labour: first stage''</ref> In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the [[vagina]], which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with [[umbilical cord]] attached.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.7, ''Normal labour: second stage''</ref> In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the [[placenta]], amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.8, ''Normal labour: third stage''</ref>\n\nEnormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable [[breathing]] in air. In the uterus, the [[unborn baby]] is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which is a hole in the septum dividing the [[right atrium]] and [[left atrium]]. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the [[right ventricle]] starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the [[left atrium]], which is pumped into the [[left ventricle]], and then pumped into the main arterial system.  As result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The [[umbilical vein]], [[umbilical arteries]], [[ductus venosus]] and [[ductus arteriosus]] are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Human Body Book |page=215 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-8561-3007-3 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |author1=Houston, Rob (editor) |author2=Lea, Maxine (art editor)}}</ref>\n\n===Cattle===\n[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|thumb|alt=Series of photos showing a cow giving birth|A cow giving birth]]\nBirthing in [[cattle]] is typical of a larger mammal. A [[cow]] goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd.  Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the [[uterus]] are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's [[cervix]] gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the [[amniotic sac]] through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf's tail and rear end in a posterior presentation).<ref name=Alberta/>  During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the [[placenta]], which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] cow.<ref name=Alberta>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3451 |title=Calving |date=2000-02-01 |publisher=Alberta: Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref><ref name=ohio>{{cite web |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/vme-fact/pdf/0029.pdf |title=Calving Management in Dairy Herds: Timing of Intervention and Stillbirth|year=2012 |publisher=The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine Extension |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref>\n\n===Dogs===\n{{further|Canine reproduction#Gestation and litters}}\nBirth is termed whelping in dogs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kustritz, M.|year=2005|title=Reproductive behaviour of small animals|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/263302746/Conducta-Reproductiva-en-Pequenos-Animales|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64 |issue=3|pages=734\u2013746|via=|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.022|pmid=15946732}}</ref> Among [[dog]]s, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent.

This may last up to 12hrs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Stage two is the passage of the offspring.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[amniotic sac]] looking like a glistening grey balloon, with a puppy inside, is propelled through the [[vulva]].  After further contractions, the sac is expelled and the bitch breaks the membranes releasing clear fluid and exposing the puppy. The mother chews at the umbilical cord and licks the puppy vigorously, which stimulates it to breathe. If the puppy has not taken its first breath within about six minutes, it is likely to die.  Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60min intervals. If a pup has not been passed in 2 hrs a veterinarian should be contacted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Stage three is the passing of the placentas.

In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization<ref>Sea World, [http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&-rays/reproduction.htm Sharks & Rays]; accessed 2013.09.09.</ref>). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.<ref name=Attenborough>{{cite book |title=The Trials of Life |last=Attenborough |first=David |year=1990 |isbn=9780002199124 |pages=26\u201330 }}</ref>\n\n[[Ovoviviparity]] is a mode of reproduction in which [[embryo]]s develop inside [[egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain in the mother's body until they are ready to hatch.

The family moved to London while he was still young.\n\nAs a young man, he was one of the so-called \"[[Whitechapel Boys]]\", a group including [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Stephen Winsten|Samuel Weinstein]] and [[Joseph Leftwich|Joseph Lefkowitz]] (who coined the name in hindsight). From about 1911, when Rosenberg arrived, they began to aspire to literary careers; and in the years before 1914 Rodker was a published essayist and poet, in ''[[The New Age]]'' of [[A. R. Orage]] and elsewhere. Other \"Whitechapel Boys\" were the painters [[David Bomberg]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]]; they all met together at or near the Whitechapel Art Gallery.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Rodker was a [[conscientious objector]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wallis|first1=Holly|title=WW1: The conscientious objectors who refused to fight|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27404266|publisher=BBC|date=15 May 2014|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> He went on the run, sheltering with the poet [[R. C. Trevelyan]], before being arrested in April 1917, imprisoned, and then transferred to the Home Office Work Centre, [[Princetown]], in the former [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor]] Prison. He describes this in his book ''Memoirs of Other Fronts.''\n\nIn 1919 Rodker started the Ovid Press, a [[small press]] which lasted about a year. It published [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] (the first edition of ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'') and portfolios of drawings by [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] and [[Edward Wadsworth]]. In the opinion of one modern scholar, \"the Ovid Press remains his most significant contribution for the originality of the titles he chose and for the place the imprint maintains alongside other private presses of the period.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cloud|first1=Gerald W.|title=John Rodker's Ovid Press: A Bibliographical History|date=2010|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, Delaware|isbn=9781584562863|page=51}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Rodker took over from Pound as foreign editor of the New York magazine, ''The Little Review''.\n\nIn the 1920s he spent time in Paris on the second edition of [[James Joyce]]'s ''Ulysses'', at that time subject to censorship, and on French translations of Joyce. He then set up the Casanova Society, for limited editions. He continued in publishing, on [[occult]] subjects under the imprint \"J. Rodker\" also, until a bankruptcy in 1932, when (along with other such ventures such as the [[Fanfrolico Press]]) his business folded in the Depression. He was included in the 1930 [[Faber and Faber]] collection ''Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress'' of Joyceans.\n\nFor a period he dropped publishing, concentrating on translation from [[French literature]], and agency work for [[Preslit]], the Soviet overseas literature organ. At this time too he apparently abandoned literary ambitions for himself. In 1937, the centennial of the death of [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], he set up the Pushkin Press, another small press, publishing [[Oliver Elton]]'s English version of ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' and a trickle of other books.\n\nThe Imago Publishing Company was a separate, more substantial venture, set up after [[Sigmund Freud]] arrived in London in 1938. The stocks of Freud's works left when he fled [[Vienna]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] had been destroyed; Rodker with [[Anna Freud]] worked to publish a complete edition. This was done over a dozen years, being finished in 1952. Imago was wound up in 1961.\n\nRodker was fluent in French, writing regularly for a French literary magazine, and was posthumously awarded the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] by the government of France.<ref name=jpaul>{{Cite web|url=https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html|title=J Paul Morrison :: Biography|website=jpaulm.github.io}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nJohn Rodker's father, David, joined the mass exodus of Jews from what is now Poland to escape the pogroms of the 1880s, moving to England, where, like a number of his family members, he worked as a corset-maker.

He was institutionalized for mental illness from 1934 until his death in 1973.\n\nJohn Rodker married three times. He and his first wife, the writer [[Mary Butts]] (1890\u20131937), married in May 1918.

[[Jane Heap]], John Rodker, Martha Dennison, [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Margaret C. Anderson]], ca. 1920s]]\n\nJohn Rodker was born on 18 December 1894 in [[Manchester]], into a [[Jew]]ish immigrant family. The family moved to London while he was still young.\n\nAs a young man he was one of the so-called \"[[Whitechapel Boys]]\", a group including [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Stephen Winsten|Samuel Weinstein]] and [[Joseph Leftwich|Joseph Lefkowitz]] (who coined the name in hindsight). From about 1911, when Rosenberg arrived, they began to aspire to literary careers; and in the years before 1914 Rodker was a published essayist and poet, in ''[[The New Age]]'' of [[A. R. Orage]] and elsewhere. Other \"Whitechapel Boys\" were the painters [[David Bomberg]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]]; they all met together at or near the Whitechapel Art Gallery.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Rodker was a [[conscientious objector]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wallis|first1=Holly|title=WW1: The conscientious objectors who refused to fight|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27404266|publisher=BBC|date=15 May 2014|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> He went on the run, sheltering with the poet [[R. C. Trevelyan]], before being arrested in April 1917, imprisoned, and then transferred to the Home Office Work Centre, [[Princetown]], in the former [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor]] Prison. He describes this in his book ''Memoirs of Other Fronts.''\n\nIn 1919 Rodker started the Ovid Press, a [[small press]] which lasted about a year. It published [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] (the first edition of ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'') and portfolios of drawings by [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] and [[Edward Wadsworth]]. In the opinion of one modern scholar, \"the Ovid Press remains his most significant contribution for the originality of the titles he chose and for the place the imprint maintains alongside other private presses of the period.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cloud|first1=Gerald W.|title=John Rodker's Ovid Press: A Bibliographical History|date=2010|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, Delaware|isbn=9781584562863|page=51}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Rodker took over from Pound as foreign editor of the New York magazine, ''The Little Review''.\n\nIn the 1920s he spent time in Paris on the second edition of [[James Joyce]]'s ''Ulysses'', at that time subject to censorship, and on French translations of Joyce. He then set up the Casanova Society, for limited editions. He continued in publishing, on [[occult]] subjects under the imprint \"J. Rodker\" also, until a bankruptcy in 1932, when (along with other such ventures such as the [[Fanfrolico Press]]) his business folded in the Depression. He was included in the 1930 [[Faber and Faber]] collection ''Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress'' of Joyceans.\n\nFor a period he dropped publishing, concentrating on translation from [[French literature]], and agency work for [[Preslit]], the Soviet overseas literature organ. At this time too he apparently abandoned literary ambitions for himself. In 1937, the centennial of the death of [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], he set up the Pushkin Press, another small press, publishing [[Oliver Elton]]'s English version of ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' and a trickle of other books.\n\nThe Imago Publishing Company was a separate, more substantial venture, set up after [[Sigmund Freud]] arrived in London in 1938. The stocks of Freud's works left when he fled [[Vienna]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] had been destroyed; Rodker with [[Anna Freud]] worked to publish a complete edition. This was done over a dozen years, being finished in 1952. Imago was wound up in 1961.\n\nRodker was fluent in French, writing regularly for a French literary magazine, and was posthumously awarded the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] by the government of France.<ref name=jpaul>{{Cite web|url=https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html|title=J Paul Morrison :: Biography|website=jpaulm.github.io}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nJohn Rodker's father, David, joined the mass exodus of Jews from what is now Poland to escape the pogroms of the 1880s, moving to England, where, like a number of his family members, he worked as a corset-maker. As far as we know, all the Rodkers in the world are related \u2013 the name seems to have been invented for (or by) just this one family. This surname appears to be a [[toponymic surname]] based on the town of [[Rodka]], now in [[Romania]] and renamed to [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]].<ref name=jpaul/> David married Leah Jacobson; their children were John and Peter.\n\nJohn's younger brother Peter, who used the surname Roker (without the \"d\"), served for five years during World War I and married Helen Scott. He was institutionalized for mental illness from 1934 until his death in 1973.\n\nJohn Rodker married three times. He and his first wife, the writer [[Mary Butts]] (1890\u20131937), married in May 1918. He already had a daughter, [[Joan Rodker|Joan]] (1915\u20132010),<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/8277253/Joan-Rodker.html Obituary: Joan Rodker], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 23 January 2011 (online edition)</ref><ref>Jenny Diski [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/joan-rodker-political-activist-who-acted-in-ukraine-campaigned-for-the-rosenbergs-and-organised-postwar-peace-conferences-2183097.html Obituary: Joan Rodker], ''The Independent'', 13 January 2011</ref> from an earlier relationship with the dancer, Sonia Cohen (1885\u20131979). His daughter by Mary Butts was Camilla (1920\u20132007), who married Henry Israel.\n\nThe second marriage was to Barbara McKenzie-Smith (1902\u20131996), a painter, resulting in a son, [[John Paul Morrison|John Paul]] (born in 1937),<ref name=jpaul/> whose surname was changed to Morrison when his mother, after a divorce, married E.A. Morrison III. [[Moura Budberg]] was John Paul's godmother.\n\nThe third marriage was to Marianne Rais (died 1984), a Paris bookseller and daughter of his translator Ludmila Savitzky.\n\nJoan Rodker's son, Ernest Rodker (born 1937), by the actor [[Gerard Heinz]], was a post-[[World War II]] [[conscientious objector]], a founder member of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] and serves as the British spokesperson for [[Mordechai Vanunu]]<ref>[http://johntyrrell.co.uk/2010/09/update-on-mordechai-vanunu/ UK Campaign to Free Mordechai Vanunu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427205937/http://johntyrrell.co.uk/2010/09/update-on-mordechai-vanunu/ |date=27 April 2011 }}</ref> and became a founding member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group.<ref>\n[http://www.batterseapowerstation.org.uk/news/latest_news.html Battersea Power Station Community Group]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Published by Rodker's Ovid Press===\n*John Rodker, ''Poems'' (1914)\n*Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, ''Twenty Drawings from the Note-Books of H.

An [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Anglo]]-[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] under the command of [[Admiral]] [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] bombarded ships and the harbour defences of [[Algiers]].\n\nThere was a continuing campaign by various European navies and the American navy to suppress the [[Barbary pirates|piracy]] against [[Europe]]ans by the North African [[Barbary Coast|Barbary states]]. The specific aim of this expedition, however, was to free Christian slaves and to stop the practice of [[Barbary Slave Trade|enslaving Europeans]]. To this end, it was partially successful, as the [[Dey]] of Algiers freed around 3,000&nbsp;slaves following the bombardment and signed a treaty against the slavery of Europeans. However, this practice did not end completely until the [[French conquest of Algeria]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:EdwardPellew.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Edward Pellew, Lord Exmouth]]]]\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, the [[Royal Navy]] no longer needed the Barbary states as a source of supplies for [[Gibraltar]] and their fleet in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This freed Britain to exert considerable political pressure to force the Barbary states to end their piracy and practice of enslaving European Christians.\n\nIn early 1816, Exmouth undertook a diplomatic mission to [[Tunis]], [[Tripoli]], and Algiers, backed by a small squadron of [[ships of the line]], to convince the Deys to stop the practice and free the Christian slaves. The Deys of Tunis and Tripoli agreed without any resistance, but the Dey of Algiers was more recalcitrant and the negotiations were stormy. Exmouth believed that he had managed to negotiate a treaty to stop the slavery of Christians and returned to England. However, due to confused orders, Algerian troops massacred 200&nbsp;[[Corsica]]n, [[Sicily|Sicilian]], and [[Sardinia]]n fishermen who were under British protection just after the treaty was signed. This caused outrage in Britain and Europe, and Exmouth's negotiations were seen as a failure.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977),  p. 160</ref>\n\nAs a result, Exmouth was ordered to sea again to complete the job and punish the Algerians. He gathered a squadron of five [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], one 50-gun spar-decked frigate ([[HMS Leander (1813)|HMS ''Leander'']]), four conventional [[frigate]]s ([[HMS Severn (1813)|HMS ''Severn'']], ''Glasgow'', ''Granicus'', and ''Hebrus''), and five [[Bomb vessels|bomb ships]] (HMS ''Belzebub'', ''Fury'', ''Hecla'', and ''Infernal''). {{HMS|Queen Charlotte|1810|6}}\u2014100 guns\u2014was his [[flagship]] and Rear Admiral [[Sir David Milne|David Milne]] was his second in command aboard {{HMS|Impregnable|1810|6}}, 98 guns. This squadron was considered by many to be an insufficient force, but Exmouth had already unobtrusively surveyed the defences of Algiers; he was very familiar with the town, and was aware of a weakness in the field of fire of the defensive batteries. He believed that more large ships would have interfered with each other without being able to bring much more fire to bear. In addition to the main fleet, there were four sloops (HMS ''Heron'', ''Mutine'', ''Cordelia'', and ''Britomart''), eight ships' boats armed with [[Congreve rocket]]s, and some transports to carry the rescued slaves.\n\nWhen the British arrived in Gibraltar, a squadron of five Dutch frigates (''Melampus'', ''Frederica'', ''Dageraad'', ''Diana'', and ''Amstel'') and the [[corvette]] ''Eendragt'', led by [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Theodorus Frederik van Capellen]], offered to join the expedition. Exmouth decided to assign them to cover the main force from Algerian flanking batteries, as there was insufficient space in the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] for the Dutch frigates.<ref>Otridge ''et al.'', p. 233</ref>\n\n==Plan of attack==\n{{main|Bombardment of Algiers order of battle}}\n[[File:Nicolaas Baur - Krijgsraad aan boord van de 'Queen Charlotte'.jpg|thumb|250px|Council of war on board the ''Queen Charlotte'', 1818, [[Nicolaas Bauer]]]]\n\nThe day before the attack, the frigate ''Prometheus'' arrived and its captain W. B. Dashwood attempted to secretly rescue the British Consul and his wife and infant. Some of the rescue party was discovered and arrested. The attack was described by the U.S. Consul.\n\nThe plan of attack was for the larger ships to approach in a column. They were to sail into the zone where the majority of the Algerian guns could not be brought to bear. Then, they were to come to anchor and bombard the batteries and fortifications on the mole to destroy the defences. Simultaneously, {{HMS|Leander|1813|6}}\u201450 guns\u2014was to anchor off the mouth of the harbour and bombard the shipping inside the mole. To protect ''Leander'' from the shore battery, frigates {{HMS|Severn|1813|6}} and {{HMS|Glasgow|1814|2}} were to sail inshore and bombard the battery.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977),  p. 162-164</ref>\n\nTroops would then storm ashore on the mole with sappers of the [[Corps of Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"HCRE\">{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Maj Gen Whitworth |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Vol I |year=1889|publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham}}</ref>{{rp|392}}\n\n==Bombardment==\nExmouth in ''Queen Charlotte'' anchored approximately {{convert|80|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the mole, facing the Algerian guns. However, a number of the other ships anchored out of position, notably Admiral Milne aboard HMS ''Impregnable'', who was 400 yards from where he should have been. This error reduced the effectiveness of these ships and exposed them to fiercer Algerian fire. Some of the other ships sailed past ''Impregnable'' and anchored in positions closer to the plan. The unfortunate gap created by the misplaced HMS ''Impregnable'' was closed by the frigate HMS ''Granicus'' and the sloop ''Heron''.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977), p. 164-</ref>\n[[File:Bombardment Algiers 1816.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch showing the positions of the fleet during the bombardment]]\n[[File:Bombardment of Algiers 1816 by Chambers.jpg|thumb|250px|Painting by [[George Chambers (painter)|George Chambers Sr.]]]]\n\nIn their earlier negotiations, both Exmouth and the Dey of Algiers had stated that they would not fire the first shot. The Dey's plan was to allow the fleet to anchor and then to sortie from the harbour and board the ships with large numbers of men in small boats. But Algerian discipline was less effective and one Algerian gun fired a shot at 15:15.

No more than four or five guns that were still mounted were visible, and many fine houses had been destroyed. The bay was filled with the smoking hulks of the remains of the Algerine navy and by many floating bodies.<ref>Salam\u00e9, A.

Without the acceptance of these terms, you can have no peace with England.\"</blockquote>\n\nHe warned that if they were not accepted, then he would continue the action. The Dey accepted the terms, not realising that they were a bluff, as the fleet had already fired off almost all of its ammunition.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977),  p. 166</ref> A treaty was signed on September 24, 1816.

An [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Anglo]]-[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] under the command of [[Admiral]] [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] bombarded ships and the harbour defences of [[Algiers]].\n\nThere was a continuing campaign by various European navies and the American navy to suppress the [[Barbary pirates|piracy]] against [[Europe]]ans by the North African [[Barbary Coast|Barbary states]]. The specific aim of this expedition, however, was to free Christian slaves and to stop the practice of [[Barbary Slave Trade|enslaving Europeans]]. To this end, it was partially successful, as the [[Dey]] of Algiers freed around 3,000&nbsp;slaves following the bombardment and signed a treaty against the slavery of Europeans. However, this practice did not end completely until the [[French conquest of Algeria]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:EdwardPellew.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Edward Pellew, Lord Exmouth]]]]\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, the [[Royal Navy]] no longer needed the Barbary states as a source of supplies for [[Gibraltar]] and their fleet in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This freed Britain to exert considerable political pressure to force the Barbary states to end their piracy and practice of enslaving European Christians.\n\nIn early 1816, Exmouth undertook a diplomatic mission to [[Tunis]], [[Tripoli]], and Algiers, backed by a small squadron of [[ships of the line]], to convince the Deys to stop the practice and free the Christian slaves. The Deys of Tunis and Tripoli agreed without any resistance, but the Dey of Algiers was more recalcitrant and the negotiations were stormy. Exmouth believed that he had managed to negotiate a treaty to stop the slavery of Christians and returned to England. However, due to confused orders, Algerian troops massacred 200&nbsp;[[Corsica]]n, [[Sicily|Sicilian]], and [[Sardinia]]n fishermen who were under British protection just after the treaty was signed. This caused outrage in Britain and Europe, and Exmouth's negotiations were seen as a failure.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977),  p. 160</ref>\n\nAs a result, Exmouth was ordered to sea again to complete the job and punish the Algerians. He gathered a squadron of five [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], one 50-gun spar-decked frigate ([[HMS Leander (1813)|HMS ''Leander'']]), four conventional [[frigate]]s ([[HMS Severn (1813)|HMS ''Severn'']], ''Glasgow'', ''Granicus'', and ''Hebrus''), and five [[Bomb vessels|bomb ships]] (HMS ''Belzebub'', ''Fury'', ''Hecla'', and ''Infernal''). {{HMS|Queen Charlotte|1810|6}}\u2014100 guns\u2014was his [[flagship]] and Rear Admiral [[Sir David Milne|David Milne]] was his second in command aboard {{HMS|Impregnable|1810|6}}, 98 guns. This squadron was considered by many to be an insufficient force, but Exmouth had already unobtrusively surveyed the defences of Algiers; he was very familiar with the town, and was aware of a weakness in the field of fire of the defensive batteries. He believed that more large ships would have interfered with each other without being able to bring much more fire to bear. In addition to the main fleet, there were four sloops (HMS ''Heron'', ''Mutine'', ''Cordelia'', and ''Britomart''), eight ships' boats armed with [[Congreve rocket]]s, and some transports to carry the rescued slaves.\n\nWhen the British arrived in Gibraltar, a squadron of five Dutch frigates (''Melampus'', ''Frederica'', ''Dageraad'', ''Diana'', and ''Amstel'') and the [[corvette]] ''Eendragt'', led by [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Theodorus Frederik van Capellen]], offered to join the expedition. Exmouth decided to assign them to cover the main force from Algerian flanking batteries, as there was insufficient space in the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] for the Dutch frigates.<ref>Otridge ''et al.'', p. 233</ref>\n\n==Plan of attack==\n{{main|Bombardment of Algiers order of battle}}\n[[File:Nicolaas Baur - Krijgsraad aan boord van de 'Queen Charlotte'.jpg|thumb|250px|Council of war on board the ''Queen Charlotte'', 1818, [[Nicolaas Bauer]]]]\n\nThe day before the attack, the frigate ''Prometheus'' arrived and its captain W. B. Dashwood attempted to secretly rescue the British Consul and his wife and infant. Some of the rescue party was discovered and arrested. The attack was described by the U.S. Consul.\n\nThe plan of attack was for the larger ships to approach in a column. They were to sail into the zone where the majority of the Algerian guns could not be brought to bear. Then, they were to come to anchor and bombard the batteries and fortifications on the mole to destroy the defences. Simultaneously, {{HMS|Leander|1813|6}}\u201450 guns\u2014was to anchor off the mouth of the harbour and bombard the shipping inside the mole. To protect ''Leander'' from the shore battery, frigates {{HMS|Severn|1813|6}} and {{HMS|Glasgow|1814|2}} were to sail inshore and bombard the battery.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977),  p. 162-164</ref>\n\nTroops would then storm ashore on the mole with sappers of the [[Corps of Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"HCRE\">{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Maj Gen Whitworth |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Vol I |year=1889|publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham}}</ref>{{rp|392}}\n\n==Bombardment==\nExmouth in ''Queen Charlotte'' anchored approximately {{convert|80|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the mole, facing the Algerian guns. However, a number of the other ships anchored out of position, notably Admiral Milne aboard HMS ''Impregnable'', who was 400 yards from where he should have been. This error reduced the effectiveness of these ships and exposed them to fiercer Algerian fire. Some of the other ships sailed past ''Impregnable'' and anchored in positions closer to the plan. The unfortunate gap created by the misplaced HMS ''Impregnable'' was closed by the frigate HMS ''Granicus'' and the sloop ''Heron''.<ref>Northcote Parkinson (1977), p. 164-</ref>\n[[File:Bombardment Algiers 1816.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch showing the positions of the fleet during the bombardment]]\n[[File:Bombardment of Algiers 1816 by Chambers.jpg|thumb|250px|Painting by [[George Chambers (painter)|George Chambers Sr.]]]]\n\nIn their earlier negotiations, both Exmouth and the Dey of Algiers had stated that they would not fire the first shot. The Dey's plan was to allow the fleet to anchor and then to sortie from the harbour and board the ships with large numbers of men in small boats. But Algerian discipline was less effective and one Algerian gun fired a shot at 15:15. Exmouth immediately began the bombardment.\n\nThe Algerian flotilla of 40 gunboats made an attempt to board ''Queen Charlotte'' while the sailors were aloft setting sail, but twenty-eight of their boats were sunk by broadsides, and the remaining ran themselves on shore.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|395}} After an hour, the cannon on the mole were effectively silenced, and Exmouth turned his attention to the shipping in the harbour, which was destroyed by 19:30.

The following season, he scored nine goals in 28 appearances for the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|under-18s]], as well as appearing a further 10 times for the reserves.
