[[Varro]] states that the actual Circus was built around the Fields, which were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was laid in 220 BC.<ref>Varro, ''De Lingua Latina'', 5.153</ref> The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]]. The rebuilding of the theatre necessitated shortening the Circus itself, and required that several temples be destroyed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=507}}</ref> \n\nThe temple of Apollo \"''in circo''\" acquired special significance under Augustus, as a popular legend developed that he had been sired by the god while his mother [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] was visiting the temple.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> Augustus undertook myriad new constructions around the Circus, and probably had it paved for the first time. Most notably Augustus demolished the small theater dedicated to Apollo, as well as the temples of Diana and Pietas, to build the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] on the eastern side of the Circus.<ref name=\"Flaminius\">{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=510-511}}</ref> Augustus also built the [[Porticus Octaviae]], which hemmed in the Circus on its southeastern side.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-008.html|title=Rome Alive: A Source Guide to the Ancient City, Vol. 1| author=Peter Aicher| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci| year=2004}}</ref> Augustus' relation [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 38 BC)|Lucius Marcius Phillipus]] restored the [[Temple of Hercules Musarum]] with a surrounding portico that could be accessed from the Circus.<ref name=\"Flaminius\"/>\n\nIn AD 15, statues to the deified Augustus were erected, dedicated by [[Gaius Norbanus Flaccus (consul 15)|C. Norbanus Flaccus]]. In the early Principate two monumental arches were added at the north and south ends of the Circus, the northern one dedicated to [[Germanicus]] in the year of his death (19 AD), and the southern one to the stepson of Augustus, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=515}}</ref> \n\n===Location===\nThe ancient arcades which in the middle ages sheltered the workshops of artisans, and thus gave the ''Via delle Botteghe Oscure'' (\"Street of Dark Shops\") its name, were long believed to be the northern substructures of the Circus Flaminius. This placed the Circus north of the ''porticus Phillipi'' between the Piazza Paganica and Piazza Margana.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/nash/feature/c| title=The Urban Legacy of Ancient Rome| publisher=Stanford.edu| access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> In the 1960s the joining of new fragments to the [[Forma Urbis]] identified the arcades as in fact belonging to the [[Theatre of Balbus]] and its connecting portico (the \"Crypta Balbi\" as the archaeological site is known). New excavations combined with the new configuration of the Marble Plan altered the understanding of where the Circus Flaminius was located, moving it southwest closer to the Tiber and placing it on a southeast-northwest axis.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40310726?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A161880d4ef63c22d17ad222e84d37e0c&seq=8#page_scan_tab_contents| title=The Circus Flaminius| author=T.P.

It almost certainly lacked a track designed for [[chariot racing]].<ref>[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211</ref> The only ''ludi'' held there were the [[Taurian Games]], which featured horseback racing around turning posts ''(metae)''.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; also recorded by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''.</ref> The obscure Taurian Games were held to [[propitiation|propitiate]] the gods of the underworld ''([[Di Inferi|di inferi]])'', and seem to have been symbolically grounded in the site itself, as they were never moved to a different circus. Equestrian events were also associated with underworld deities in other rituals and festivals in the Campus Martius. [[Strabo]] makes no mention of equestrian activities taking place in the Circus Flaminius. [[Valerius Maximus]], who is likely to be in error, is the only ancient source that claims the ''Ludi Plebeii'' ([[Plebeian Games]]) were held there. In 2 BC, the circus was flooded for the slaughter of 36 crocodiles to commemorate the building of the [[Forum of Augustus]].<ref> Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 55.10</ref>\n\nThe Circus also hosted ceremonies related to the [[Roman triumph]], as the Flaminian Fields traditionally figured along the triumphal route towards Capitoline Hill. In 63 BC [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] celebrated his triumph in the [[Third Mithridatic War]] and exhibited his spoils in the Circus, including a solid gold statue of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> Augustus did the same when he exhibited the captured insignia of the enemy armies from his campaigns in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] in the northern part of the Circus.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], the Dictator [[Sulla]] massacred 6,000 prisoners in the Circus Flaminius after the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]] in 82 BC. Prisoners of war from the nearby town of [[Antemnae]] were rounded up in the Circus and slaughtered while the Senate met in the adjacent [[Temple of Bellona, Rome|Temple of Bellona]]; the screams which could be heard from the Temple were a way of intimidating the Senators.<ref>Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives''; XXX.II</ref>\n\nThe Circus Flaminius was also used as a market. [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]] were often held within it. In 9 BC, it was the venue when [[Augustus]] delivered the ''Laudatio'' of Drusus.\n\n==Later history==\nThe buildings remained in use until the end of the fourth century, when the area was finally abandoned. In the middle ages the ruins of the [[Stadium of Domitian]] (the [[Piazza Navona]]) were often incorrectly identified as the Circus Flaminius. In the 16th century the \"Castrum Aureum\" (\"golden camp\") mentioned in a [[Papal Bull]] of [[Pope Celestin III]] in 1192, was also identified as the Circus.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/nash/feature/c| title=The Urban Legacy of Ancient Rome| publisher=Stanford.edu| access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \n\nIn 1555 [[Pope Paul IV]] formed the [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish Ghetto]] in the area encompassing much of the former Circus Flaminius.

[[Varro]] states that the actual Circus was built around the Fields, which were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was laid in 220 BC.<ref>Varro, ''De Lingua Latina'', 5.153</ref> The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]]. The rebuilding of the theatre necessitated shortening the Circus itself, and required that several temples be destroyed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=507}}</ref> \n\nThe temple of Apollo \"''in circo''\" acquired special significance under Augustus, as a popular legend developed that he had been sired by the god while his mother [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] was visiting the temple.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> Augustus undertook myriad new constructions around the Circus, and probably had it paved for the first time.

Norbanus Flaccus]]. In the early Principate two monumental arches were added at the north and south ends of the Circus, the northern one dedicated to [[Germanicus]] in the year of his death (19 AD), and the southern one to the stepson of Augustus, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=515}}</ref> \n\n===Location===\nThe ancient arcades which in the middle ages sheltered the workshops of artisans, and thus gave the ''Via delle Botteghe Oscure'' (\"Street of Dark Shops\") its name, were long believed to be the northern substructures of the Circus Flaminius.

It almost certainly lacked a track designed for [[chariot racing]].<ref>[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211</ref> The only ''ludi'' held there were the [[Taurian Games]], which featured horseback racing around turning posts ''(metae)''.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; also recorded by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''.</ref> The obscure Taurian Games were held to [[propitiation|propitiate]] the gods of the underworld ''([[Di Inferi|di inferi]])'', and seem to have been symbolically grounded in the site itself, as they were never moved to a different circus.

Parsons Law Library''' (also known as the '''May and Cooney Dry Goods Company Building''') is a historic commercial building in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].  It was built in 1913 by the May and Cooney Dry Goods company to replace their building which was destroyed by a fire in 1911.  The store occupied the building until 1931, when they went bankrupt due to the [[Great Depression]].  [[J. C. Penney]] moved into the building in 1934 and remained until 1966, when it moved to \"The Mall\" on University Drive.  In 1973, it was purchased by the county and renovated to house a public [[law library]].\n\nThe building is a three-story structure with the fa\u00e7ade faced in white glazed [[terra cotta]].  The street level has a large arch, decorated with a line of [[bay leaf]] clusters surrounded by alternating green and red blocks.  The inside of the arch was converted from a storefront to large glass panes with a single central entrance in the 1973 renovation.  The second and third floors each have five one-over-one [[sash window]]s, with the third floor windows slightly smaller than the second.

Parsons Law Library''' (also known as the '''May and Cooney Dry Goods Company Building''') is a historic commercial building in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].  It was built in 1913 by the May and Cooney Dry Goods company to replace their building which was destroyed by a fire in 1911.  The store occupied the building until 1931, when they went bankrupt due to the [[Great Depression]].  [[J. C. Penney]] moved into the building in 1934 and remained until 1966, when it moved to \"The Mall\" on University Drive.  In 1973, it was purchased by the county and renovated to house a public [[law library]].\n\nThe building is a three-story structure with the fa\u00e7ade faced in white glazed [[terra cotta]].  The street level has a large arch, decorated with a line of [[bay leaf]] clusters surrounded by alternating green and red blocks.  The inside of the arch was converted from a storefront to large glass panes with a single central entrance in the 1973 renovation.  The second and third floors each have five one-over-one [[sash window]]s, with the third floor windows slightly smaller than the second.  The building is topped with a projecting course of bay leaf [[garland]]s, a set of five colored panels in line with the windows, and a [[corbel]]ed [[cornice]] with several rows of geometric designs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bayer |first=Linda |title=May and Cooney Dry Goods Company |url={{NRHP url|id=80000720}} |work=Historic Resources of Downtown Huntsville |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |date=May 31, 1979 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RXTYOyWb?url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/nrhp/text/80000720.pdf |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |url-status=live }} ''See also:'' {{cite web|title=Accompanying photos |url={{NRHP url|id=80000720|photos=y}} |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RXTZ65Ux?url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/nrhp/photos/80000720.pdf |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|May and Cooney Dry Goods Building}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Alabama}}\n\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huntsville, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1913]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Huntsville, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Libraries in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Law libraries]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Libraries established in 1973]]\n\n\n{{Alabama-NRHP-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbert_H._Parsons_Law_Library"}

He also played with [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] where he won the [[Super League Greece|Alpha Ethniki]] two times and the [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] once.\n\nAs a manager, Bajevi\u0107 has also had success, winning one [[Yugoslav Cup]] with Vele\u017e, four [[Super League Greece|Greek league title]]s, one [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]], one [[Greek League Cup]] and one [[Greek Super Cup]] with [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], then four Greek league titles and two Greek Cups with [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and one Greek Cup with [[PAOK FC|PAOK]].\n\n==Club career==\nBajevi\u0107 was the total player. He played almost 400 games for local club [[FK Vele\u017e Mostar|Vele\u017e Mostar]] where he scored 170 goals. His coach was [[Sulejman Rebac]]. He stayed in Vele\u017e from 1966 to 1977 before going to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], where he won the [[Superleague Greece|Greek championship]] twice. He is one of the most controversial figures in the history of the club. Bajevi\u0107 was a successful player, loved by AEK's fans who gave him the nickname \"'''Prince'''\" (''\u03a0\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2'').\n\nHe joined the team in 1977 along with other great players of the era and won two championships and one cup title. His combination with [[Thomas Mavros]] was one of the best in Europe and one of the club's most beloved scoring duo. Bajevi\u0107 was also the league's top scorer during the [[1979\u201380 Alpha Ethniki|1979\u201380 season]].\n\nHe came back to Vele\u017e in 1981 and stayed to 1983 before retiring. During his career, He was together with [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]] the best goalscorer in the [[1969\u201370 Yugoslav First League]] season, scoring 20 goals. Bajevi\u0107 is remembered as \"The Prince of Neretva\" and was part of the Vele\u017e three known as the \"Mostar BMV\" (Bajevi\u0107, [[Enver Mari\u0107|Mari\u0107]] and [[Franjo Vladi\u0107|Vladi\u0107]]) during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n\n==International career==\t\nBajevi\u0107 played for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]] in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] where he scored three goals against [[DR Congo national football team|Zaire]]. He scored 29 times and earend 37 caps for Yugoslavia during his international career which spanned for seven years, from 1970 to 1977.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Vele\u017e Mostar===\nAfter ending his football career in 1983, Bajevi\u0107 took over the role as manager of [[FK Vele\u017e Mostar|Vele\u017e]]. He led the team to win the [[Yugoslav Cup]] in 1986 by defeating [[Dinamo Zagreb]] 3\u20131 in the final. The next season Vele\u017e finished the league in second spot and Bajevi\u0107 went to Greece to manage [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].\n\n===AEK Athens===\nHe took over AEK's head coaching position in 1988. During his first season in charge ([[Alpha Ethniki 1988\u201389|1988\u201389]]), he managed to lead the team to an unexpected championship, delivering the league title to the club after a ten-year drought since he last won it as a player. He then went on to win three consecutive championships ([[Alpha Ethniki 1991-92|1992]], [[Alpha Ethniki 1992-93|1993]], [[Alpha Ethniki 1993-94|1994]]), one Greek Super Cup (1989), one League Cup (1990), one Pre-Mediterranean Cup (1991) and one Greek Cup ([[Greek Cup 1995-96|1996]]).\n\nThe club also had several decent campaigns in Europe under his management. Namely, they reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] last 16 once ([[1989\u201390 European Cup|1990]], and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] last 16 twice ([[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]]) and [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League|1995]]), the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] last 16 once ([[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1996]]) and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] last 16 once ([[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1992]]).\n\n===Olympiacos===\nIn 1996, after eight glorious seasons at AEK, Bajevi\u0107 moved to [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], bringing great fan hostility upon himself from AEK supporters. While he was Olympiacos' manager, Olympiacos won their first [[Alpha Ethniki|championship]] in 1997 after ten sterile years, and became champions for three consecutive times. In 1999, Olympiacos won [[Double (association football)|the Double]] and, for the first and only time in their history, reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter finals.\n\nIn the [[1996\u201397 Alpha Ethniki|1996\u201397]] season, Bajevi\u0107 led Olympiacos to the championship after 10 years, putting an end to the \"stone years'. This season, the team ended the [[Alpha Ethniki|League]] with a 12 points difference from [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], and 20 points difference from [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].\n\nThe next season, [[Alpha Ethniki 1997-98|1997\u201398]], Olympiacos participated for first time in the [[UEFA Champions League]] ending with a 3rd place in the group. In the Alpha Ethniki, Bajevi\u0107's team along with AEK and Panathinaikos were too close in the table, but finally Olympiacos made an important away win against Panathinaikos (0\u20132) and celebrated the second consecutive championship, with three points difference from Panathinaikos.\n\n1998\u201399 was a very successful season. Olympiacos reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter finals, losing to [[Juventus]] (1\u20132 loss in Italy and 1\u20131 in the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]]). They also won the domestic [[Double (association football)|double]]. In the league they ended with 10 points difference from AEK and 11 from Panathinaikos. In the [[Greek Cup 1998-99|Cup]], Olympiacos won 2\u20130, beating rivals Panathinaikos.\n\nThe fans had great expectations for the 1999\u201300 season with the additions of [[Giovanni Silva de Oliveira|Giovanni]] and [[Zlatko Zahovi\u010d]] to the squad, but Bajevi\u0107's team only achieved a 3rd place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage. The head coach was sacked on 11 November 1999, despite Olympiacos holding the top spot in the [[Alpha Ethniki 1999-2000|league]] at the time.\n\n===PAOK===\nBajevi\u0107 wasn't out of a job for long, moving [[Geography of Greece|north]] to the region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and its capital [[Thessaloniki]], where he had a decent spell at financially strapped [[PAOK FC|PAOK]]. During his stay at the club, he won the Greek Cup in 2001 (after a near-thirty year wait) beating \u039flympiakos 2\u20134 in Athens in a game in which his team delivered very high quality football.\n\n===AEK, second time===\nIn the summer of 2002, Bajevi\u0107 returned to AEK. Fans were bitterly divided among those who accepted him and those who couldn't forgive his defection to Olympiacos. The latter made his life a living hell. In the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|2002\u201303]] Champions League, AEK became the first and only team to collect six ties out of six games in the group phase and ended up at third position. A notable match was the 3\u20133 draw against reigning European champions [[Real Madrid]] at the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]] and another 2\u20132 draw against [[Real Madrid]] coming back from 2\u20130 down at the Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nStill, the antagonism with a section of AEK fans persisted. During a league match against [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]] on 25 January 2004, Bajevi\u0107 decided he had enough abuse and with no prior warning left the bench and resigned while the game was still in first half.\n\n===Olympiacos, second time===\nIn 2004, he returned to Olympiacos, where he won the double again. Also, his team got very close to the second round of the Champions League by collecting ten points, however the defeat against [[Liverpool F.C.]] with 3\u20131 in the last game stopped them not making it to the next round. Olympiacos went as far as the fourth round of the UEFA Cup. Despite these good results, he quit, mainly due to the pressure from Gate 7 fans who were not satisfied with the team's way of playing, although the majority of the fans were on his side.\n\n===Red Star Belgrade===\nOn 25 May 2006, Bajevi\u0107 became the coach of the former European Cup champion [[Red Star Belgrade]]. He was brought in by club president [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107]] as a replacement to recently departed [[Walter Zenga]], with the appointment generally welcomed by club's fans due to Bajevi\u0107's glowing reputation as an experienced coach with plenty of success from the Greek league.\n\nThe expectations were also plentiful as Red Star, [[First League of Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia-Montenegro league]] champion, was getting ready to start [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds|qualifying]]. After easily progressing from the initial stage versus Irish champions [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]], they were drawn against powerhouse [[AC Milan]] in the final qualifying round, putting up decent resistance en route to 1\u20133 aggregate loss. Despite the failure to get into the Champions League, many still took some positives from the Milan clash, however things were different when Bajevi\u0107's squad got eliminated from the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in the first round by [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]] with embarrassing ease (1\u20134 on aggregate, including the 1\u20132 loss at home) thus failing to reach the group stage.\n\nIn contrast to European failures, the domestic league form was satisfactory with Bajevi\u0107 leading the team to top of the league with 14 points in spare at the winter break. However, the second part of the season began with an inexplicable dip in form. The slide continued and on 24 February 2007 Red Star lost 4\u20132 to eternal rivals FK Partizan. A few days later on 27 February 2007, angry fans made damage to Bajevi\u0107's club-issued Toyota SUV by slaming a brick through its side window while the car was parked at the Markana stadium parking lot during Bajevi\u0107's guest appearance on SOS kanal TV station.<ref>[http://www.nezavisne.com/sport/ostali/6506/Bajevicu-razbijen-terenac.html Bajevi\u0107u razbijen terenac]; ''Nezavisne novine'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nThe end of Bajevi\u0107's stint with Red Star came in shocking fashion on 10 March 2007 during a league match versus [[FK Vojvodina]]. Red Star was down 0\u20132 at home, prompting the fans to start chanting \"Du\u0161an leave\". Soon after the chant was picked up by the majority of the north stand where the [[Delije|club's most loyal supporters]] gather, Bajevi\u0107 decided to walk out on the team in the middle of the match, leaving the pitch in 70th minute.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/14/europeanfootball.sport Red Star's lustre fading fast as Bajevic snaps again];Jonathan Wilson's Blog @ guardian.co.uk, 14 March 2007</ref> The match finished 0\u20133, shrinking Red Star's lead at the top of the table to only 6 points. Bajevi\u0107's overall league record at the helm of Red Star during [[2006\u201307 Serbian Superliga|2006\u201307 season]] was 14 league wins, 3 draws, and 3 losses.\n\n===Aris===\nOn 7 September 2007, Bajevi\u0107 signed a 3-year contract with [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arisfc.gr/index.php?SCREEN=trainer&TrainerID=5|title=Profile in Aris official website|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090810/http://www.arisfc.gr/index.php?SCREEN=trainer&TrainerID=5|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nDuring the [[2007\u201308 Alpha Ethniki|2007\u201308]] season, when he was the head coach of [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], the team played superb football. Aris reached both a respectable 4th place in the [[Greek Super League]] and reached the [[Greek Cup]] final, where the team was beaten by Greek champions [[Olympiacos F.C.]] with the score of 2\u20130. On 1 July 2008, he decided to resign, allegedly because Aris president Labros Skordas demanded that he bench star defender [[Avraam Papadopoulos]], after the latter rejected a contract extension.\n\nIn the UEFA Cup, Aris made excellent performances, eliminating [[Real Zaragoza]] and beating 3\u20130 Bajevi\u0107's old club Red Star Belgrade at home. Although, draws with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] and [[SC Braga]] and a 6\u20130 away loss to [[F.C. Bayern Munich|Bayern]] at Munich ended the team's dreams for qualification.\n\nAfter his resignation, he was immediately related with [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], while there were reports that there was a contract to be pented by the side of Bajevi\u0107. But he finally decided not to join the team, which eventually appointed [[Henk ten Cate]].\nBy the end of October, when the team of Panathinaikos was totally under-performing, and while ten Cate was on the verge of being sacked, the football manager of Panathinaikos, [[Kostas Antoniou]] was said to have asked once again Bajevi\u0107 to become the coach of the greens, but both sides rejected this relation.\n\n===AEK, third time===\nOn 21 November 2008, Bajevi\u0107 made his second return to AEK<ref>[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&n_id=4638 Bajevic returns to AEK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214174700/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&n_id=4638 |date=14 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=776619.html|title=AEK turn to familiar face Bajevi\u0107|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref> together with two other former players of AEK, [[Stelios Manolas]] in the position of the technical director and [[Lysandros Georgamlis]] as assistant coach.\n\nIn his first interview since being re-appointed as the head coach of AEK, Bajevi\u0107 covered a range of issues including the squad he had inherited, his ambitions for the remainder of what has so far been a difficult season, the possibility of a return to the club's symbolic home ground\u2014the Nikos Goumas Stadium at Nea Philadelphia\u2014and about his well-documented relationship with the fans.\n\nOn a possible return of AEK returning to the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]], Bajevi\u0107 said: \"It is my home because as a player and a manager I lived there\", \"I'm not the only one who wants a stadium at [[Nea Philadelphia]] \u2013 there are a lot of others who want it there.\"\nHe then went on to discuss his relationship with the fans and Original 21, \"I have said sorry to whoever I aggrieved and I say sorry again to everyone\", \"We can't afford to talk about it now though.

During his first season in charge ([[Alpha Ethniki 1988\u201389|1988\u201389]]), he managed to lead the team to an unexpected championship, delivering the league title to the club after a ten-year drought since he last won it as a player. He then went on to win three consecutive championships ([[Alpha Ethniki 1991-92|1992]], [[Alpha Ethniki 1992-93|1993]], [[Alpha Ethniki 1993-94|1994]]), one Greek Super Cup (1989), one League Cup (1990), one Pre-Mediterranean Cup (1991) and one Greek Cup ([[Greek Cup 1995-96|1996]]).\n\nThe club also had several decent campaigns in Europe under his management. Namely, they reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] last 16 once ([[1989\u201390 European Cup|1990]], and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] last 16 twice ([[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1993]]) and [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League|1995]]), the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] last 16 once ([[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1996]]) and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] last 16 once ([[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|1992]]).\n\n===Olympiacos===\nIn 1996, after eight glorious seasons at AEK, Bajevi\u0107 moved to [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], bringing great fan hostility upon himself from AEK supporters. While he was Olympiacos' manager, Olympiacos won their first [[Alpha Ethniki|championship]] in 1997 after ten sterile years, and became champions for three consecutive times. In 1999, Olympiacos won [[Double (association football)|the Double]] and, for the first and only time in their history, reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter finals.\n\nIn the [[1996\u201397 Alpha Ethniki|1996\u201397]] season, Bajevi\u0107 led Olympiacos to the championship after 10 years, putting an end to the \"stone years'. This season, the team ended the [[Alpha Ethniki|League]] with a 12 points difference from [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], and 20 points difference from [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].\n\nThe next season, [[Alpha Ethniki 1997-98|1997\u201398]], Olympiacos participated for first time in the [[UEFA Champions League]] ending with a 3rd place in the group. In the Alpha Ethniki, Bajevi\u0107's team along with AEK and Panathinaikos were too close in the table, but finally Olympiacos made an important away win against Panathinaikos (0\u20132) and celebrated the second consecutive championship, with three points difference from Panathinaikos.\n\n1998\u201399 was a very successful season. Olympiacos reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter finals, losing to [[Juventus]] (1\u20132 loss in Italy and 1\u20131 in the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]]). They also won the domestic [[Double (association football)|double]]. In the league they ended with 10 points difference from AEK and 11 from Panathinaikos. In the [[Greek Cup 1998-99|Cup]], Olympiacos won 2\u20130, beating rivals Panathinaikos.\n\nThe fans had great expectations for the 1999\u201300 season with the additions of [[Giovanni Silva de Oliveira|Giovanni]] and [[Zlatko Zahovi\u010d]] to the squad, but Bajevi\u0107's team only achieved a 3rd place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage. The head coach was sacked on 11 November 1999, despite Olympiacos holding the top spot in the [[Alpha Ethniki 1999-2000|league]] at the time.\n\n===PAOK===\nBajevi\u0107 wasn't out of a job for long, moving [[Geography of Greece|north]] to the region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and its capital [[Thessaloniki]], where he had a decent spell at financially strapped [[PAOK FC|PAOK]]. During his stay at the club, he won the Greek Cup in 2001 (after a near-thirty year wait) beating \u039flympiakos 2\u20134 in Athens in a game in which his team delivered very high quality football.\n\n===AEK, second time===\nIn the summer of 2002, Bajevi\u0107 returned to AEK. Fans were bitterly divided among those who accepted him and those who couldn't forgive his defection to Olympiacos. The latter made his life a living hell. In the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|2002\u201303]] Champions League, AEK became the first and only team to collect six ties out of six games in the group phase and ended up at third position. A notable match was the 3\u20133 draw against reigning European champions [[Real Madrid]] at the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]] and another 2\u20132 draw against [[Real Madrid]] coming back from 2\u20130 down at the Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nStill, the antagonism with a section of AEK fans persisted. During a league match against [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]] on 25 January 2004, Bajevi\u0107 decided he had enough abuse and with no prior warning left the bench and resigned while the game was still in first half.\n\n===Olympiacos, second time===\nIn 2004, he returned to Olympiacos, where he won the double again. Also, his team got very close to the second round of the Champions League by collecting ten points, however the defeat against [[Liverpool F.C.]] with 3\u20131 in the last game stopped them not making it to the next round. Olympiacos went as far as the fourth round of the UEFA Cup. Despite these good results, he quit, mainly due to the pressure from Gate 7 fans who were not satisfied with the team's way of playing, although the majority of the fans were on his side.\n\n===Red Star Belgrade===\nOn 25 May 2006, Bajevi\u0107 became the coach of the former European Cup champion [[Red Star Belgrade]]. He was brought in by club president [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107]] as a replacement to recently departed [[Walter Zenga]], with the appointment generally welcomed by club's fans due to Bajevi\u0107's glowing reputation as an experienced coach with plenty of success from the Greek league.\n\nThe expectations were also plentiful as Red Star, [[First League of Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia-Montenegro league]] champion, was getting ready to start [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds|qualifying]]. After easily progressing from the initial stage versus Irish champions [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]], they were drawn against powerhouse [[AC Milan]] in the final qualifying round, putting up decent resistance en route to 1\u20133 aggregate loss. Despite the failure to get into the Champions League, many still took some positives from the Milan clash, however things were different when Bajevi\u0107's squad got eliminated from the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in the first round by [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]] with embarrassing ease (1\u20134 on aggregate, including the 1\u20132 loss at home) thus failing to reach the group stage.\n\nIn contrast to European failures, the domestic league form was satisfactory with Bajevi\u0107 leading the team to top of the league with 14 points in spare at the winter break. However, the second part of the season began with an inexplicable dip in form. The slide continued and on 24 February 2007 Red Star lost 4\u20132 to eternal rivals FK Partizan. A few days later on 27 February 2007, angry fans made damage to Bajevi\u0107's club-issued Toyota SUV by slaming a brick through its side window while the car was parked at the Markana stadium parking lot during Bajevi\u0107's guest appearance on SOS kanal TV station.<ref>[http://www.nezavisne.com/sport/ostali/6506/Bajevicu-razbijen-terenac.html Bajevi\u0107u razbijen terenac]; ''Nezavisne novine'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nThe end of Bajevi\u0107's stint with Red Star came in shocking fashion on 10 March 2007 during a league match versus [[FK Vojvodina]]. Red Star was down 0\u20132 at home, prompting the fans to start chanting \"Du\u0161an leave\". Soon after the chant was picked up by the majority of the north stand where the [[Delije|club's most loyal supporters]] gather, Bajevi\u0107 decided to walk out on the team in the middle of the match, leaving the pitch in 70th minute.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/14/europeanfootball.sport Red Star's lustre fading fast as Bajevic snaps again];Jonathan Wilson's Blog @ guardian.co.uk, 14 March 2007</ref> The match finished 0\u20133, shrinking Red Star's lead at the top of the table to only 6 points. Bajevi\u0107's overall league record at the helm of Red Star during [[2006\u201307 Serbian Superliga|2006\u201307 season]] was 14 league wins, 3 draws, and 3 losses.\n\n===Aris===\nOn 7 September 2007, Bajevi\u0107 signed a 3-year contract with [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arisfc.gr/index.php?SCREEN=trainer&TrainerID=5|title=Profile in Aris official website|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090810/http://www.arisfc.gr/index.php?SCREEN=trainer&TrainerID=5|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nDuring the [[2007\u201308 Alpha Ethniki|2007\u201308]] season, when he was the head coach of [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], the team played superb football. Aris reached both a respectable 4th place in the [[Greek Super League]] and reached the [[Greek Cup]] final, where the team was beaten by Greek champions [[Olympiacos F.C.]] with the score of 2\u20130. On 1 July 2008, he decided to resign, allegedly because Aris president Labros Skordas demanded that he bench star defender [[Avraam Papadopoulos]], after the latter rejected a contract extension.\n\nIn the UEFA Cup, Aris made excellent performances, eliminating [[Real Zaragoza]] and beating 3\u20130 Bajevi\u0107's old club Red Star Belgrade at home. Although, draws with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] and [[SC Braga]] and a 6\u20130 away loss to [[F.C. Bayern Munich|Bayern]] at Munich ended the team's dreams for qualification.\n\nAfter his resignation, he was immediately related with [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], while there were reports that there was a contract to be pented by the side of Bajevi\u0107. But he finally decided not to join the team, which eventually appointed [[Henk ten Cate]].\nBy the end of October, when the team of Panathinaikos was totally under-performing, and while ten Cate was on the verge of being sacked, the football manager of Panathinaikos, [[Kostas Antoniou]] was said to have asked once again Bajevi\u0107 to become the coach of the greens, but both sides rejected this relation.\n\n===AEK, third time===\nOn 21 November 2008, Bajevi\u0107 made his second return to AEK<ref>[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&n_id=4638 Bajevic returns to AEK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214174700/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&n_id=4638 |date=14 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=776619.html|title=AEK turn to familiar face Bajevi\u0107|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref> together with two other former players of AEK, [[Stelios Manolas]] in the position of the technical director and [[Lysandros Georgamlis]] as assistant coach.\n\nIn his first interview since being re-appointed as the head coach of AEK, Bajevi\u0107 covered a range of issues including the squad he had inherited, his ambitions for the remainder of what has so far been a difficult season, the possibility of a return to the club's symbolic home ground\u2014the Nikos Goumas Stadium at Nea Philadelphia\u2014and about his well-documented relationship with the fans.\n\nOn a possible return of AEK returning to the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]], Bajevi\u0107 said: \"It is my home because as a player and a manager I lived there\", \"I'm not the only one who wants a stadium at [[Nea Philadelphia]] \u2013 there are a lot of others who want it there.\"\nHe then went on to discuss his relationship with the fans and Original 21, \"I have said sorry to whoever I aggrieved and I say sorry again to everyone\", \"We can't afford to talk about it now though.

AEK in the league, finished 4th, thus qualifying for the seasons annual play-offs in which AEK finished 2nd meaning qualification for next seasons [[Europa League]]. Bajevi\u0107 managed to get AEK to the Greek Cup Final where they came up short handed as they lost 16\u201315 on penalties to [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] after the game finished 4\u20134 after extra time.\n\nOn 7 August 2010 Bajevi\u0107 faced one of his worst moments in football.

{"title_page": "Desert Garden Conservatory", "text_new": "[[File:Flowering Aloe in the desert garden.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Desert Garden Conservatory]]\n[[Image:A CDP 4.JPG|thumb|right|Interior View of the Desert Garden Conservatory]]\n\nThe '''Desert Garden Conservatory''' is a large botanical [[greenhouse]] and part of the [[Huntington Library]], Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, in [[San Marino, California]].<ref>[http://www.huntington.org The Huntington Library website]</ref>   It was constructed in 1985. The Desert Garden Conservatory is adjacent to the {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Huntington Desert Garden]] itself. The Garden houses one of the most important collections of [[cacti]] and other [[succulent]] plants in the world, including a large number of rare and [[endangered species]]. The {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Desert Garden Conservatory serves The Huntington and public communities as a conservation facility, research resource and genetic diversity preserve. [[John N. Trager]] is the Desert Collection [[curator]].\n\nThere are an estimated 10,000 [[succulent]]s worldwide, about 1,500 of them classified as [[cacti]]. The Huntington Desert Garden Conservatory now contains more than 2,200 accessions, representing more than 43 plant families, 1,261 different [[species]] and [[subspecies]], and 246 [[genera]]. The plant collection contains examples from the world's major desert regions, including the southern United States, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, [[Canary Islands]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], Mexico and [[South Africa]]. The Desert Collection plays a critical role as a repository of [[biodiversity]], in addition to serving as an outreach and education center.\n\n== Propagation program to save rare and endangered plants ==\n\nSome studies estimate that as many as two-thirds of the world\u2019s flora and fauna may become extinct during the course of the 21st century, the result of global warming and encroaching development. Scientists alarmed by these prospects are working diligently to propagate plants outside their natural [[habitats]], in protected areas. Ex-situ cultivation, as this practice is known, can serve as a stopgap for plants that will otherwise be lost to the world as their habitats disappear. To this end, The Huntington has a program to protect and [[plant propagate]] endangered plant species, designated '''International Succulent Introductions''' (ISI).\n\nThe aim of the '''ISI program''' is to propagate and distribute new or rare succulents to collectors, nurseries and institutions to further research and appreciation of these remarkable plants. The ISI distributes as many as 40 new succulent varieties every year. Field-collected plants, [[cutting]]s or seeds are not sold, only [[seedling]]s, grafts and rooted cuttings produced under nursery conditions without detriment to wild populations.\n\n== The Schick hybrids ==\n\nThe '''Schick hybrids'''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huntington.org/BotanicalDiv/Schick/catalogindex.html |title=ISI Schick Hybrids |access-date=2008-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515092628/http://www.huntington.org/BotanicalDiv/Schick/catalogindex.html |archive-date=2008-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are derived primarily from crosses of Harry Johnson\u2019s Paramount [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, created in the 1930s and 40s, and from successive crosses of their progeny.

The Desert Garden Conservatory is adjacent to the {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Huntington Desert Garden]] itself. The Garden houses one of the most important collections of [[cacti]] and other [[succulent]] plants in the world, including a large number of rare and [[endangered species]]. The {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Desert Garden Conservatory serves The Huntington and public communities as a conservation facility, research resource and genetic diversity preserve. [[John N. Trager]] is the Desert Collection [[curator]].\n\nThere are an estimated 10,000 [[succulent]]s worldwide, about 1,500 of them classified as [[cacti]]. The Huntington Desert Garden Conservatory now contains more than 2,200 accessions, representing more than 43 plant families, 1,261 different [[species]] and [[subspecies]], and 246 [[genera]]. The plant collection contains examples from the world's major desert regions, including the southern United States, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, [[Canary Islands]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], Mexico and [[South Africa]]. The Desert Collection plays a critical role as a repository of [[biodiversity]], in addition to serving as an outreach and education center.\n\n== Propagation program to save rare and endangered plants ==\n\nSome studies estimate that as many as two-thirds of the world\u2019s flora and fauna may become extinct during the course of the 21st century, the result of global warming and encroaching development. Scientists alarmed by these prospects are working diligently to propagate plants outside their natural [[habitats]], in protected areas. Ex-situ cultivation, as this practice is known, can serve as a stopgap for plants that will otherwise be lost to the world as their habitats disappear. To this end, The Huntington has a program to protect and [[plant propagate]] endangered plant species, designated '''International Succulent Introductions''' (ISI).\n\nThe aim of the '''ISI program''' is to propagate and distribute new or rare succulents to collectors, nurseries and institutions to further research and appreciation of these remarkable plants. The ISI distributes as many as 40 new succulent varieties every year. Field-collected plants, [[cutting]]s or seeds are not sold, only [[seedling]]s, grafts and rooted cuttings produced under nursery conditions without detriment to wild populations.\n\n== The Schick hybrids ==\n\nThe '''Schick hybrids'''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huntington.org/BotanicalDiv/Schick/catalogindex.html |title=ISI Schick Hybrids |access-date=2008-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515092628/http://www.huntington.org/BotanicalDiv/Schick/catalogindex.html |archive-date=2008-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are derived primarily from crosses of Harry Johnson\u2019s Paramount [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, created in the 1930s and 40s, and from successive crosses of their progeny. Like the Paramount hybrids, the Schick hybrids can flower several times in a season and, with increasing age, can produce greater numbers of flowers. Under the Huntington\u2019s growing conditions the first flush of flowers is typically in April with successive flushes occurring in May, June and July, and, in some hybrids, even into August, September and October.
