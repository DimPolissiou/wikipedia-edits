After being informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died. Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease.  \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>.\n==Irony==\nThe irony of the death of Louise Mallard is something that plays a big role in the layout of the story. They say that she died \"From the joy that kills.\" She killed herself, not knowing that that would be the thing to kill her. She was finally realizing that she was happy without Brently in her life. When he arrives back home, she realizes that she is no longer happy again and that her life is just going to go back to the way it was before she thought he was dead. She ends up dying of heart complications, which in turn is the irony because we could read the story and see that she was going to die a lonely and almost depressed life. Then, she really ends up dying from her own joy killing her because she was excited to finally not have to deal with her husband.<ref>https://mycourses.purdue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabaction?tab_tab_group_id=_17_1</ref>\n==Themes==\n\"The Story of an Hour\" really focuses on women's search to find their own identities within themselves. Chopin, herself, liked to call this the \"possession of self-assertion.\" We can see by reading this story that she has brought her own life into the story. This story is like the background of Chopin. She had those rocky marriages. She was looking to find her own identity within herself. Louise is the Chopin during this story. She struggled to find herself many of times. This theme seems to really help Kate Chopin get an understanding of her own life during the times she was in. <ref>https://www.katechopin.org/the-story-of-an-hour/#themes</ref>\n\n==Critical responses==\nBert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459\u2013473.</ref>\n\nLawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L.

EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\nWhile most readers infer Kate Chopin\u2019s \u201cThe Story of an Hour\u201d tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man\u2019s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there\u2019s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201croomy\u201d armchairs, and how one armchair sat \u201cfacing the open window\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife \u2014A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>\n\nIn the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn\u2019t feel the same.

Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was \u201cpressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul\u201d simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change.

However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. \n\nInstead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.

Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].\n\nRegular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n===Under Roone Arledge===\nOnly after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic \u2013 Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]].

Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].\n\nRegular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n===Under Roone Arledge===\nOnly after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic \u2013 Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]].
