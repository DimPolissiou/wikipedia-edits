He returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence so that he can take part in a tryout with a semi-pro team, and decides to stay and help his father and older brother on their family ranch. Colt is frequently the butt of their jokes, particularly when it comes to his ranching skills (or lack thereof) and his disappointing pro football career.  He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense, but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue throughout the first season, it's implied that Colt has played for the [[Barcelona Dragons]], [[San Jose SaberCats]], [[Spokane Shock]], [[Orlando Predators]], [[Nebraska Danger]], [[Iowa Barnstormers]], [[Green Bay Blizzard]], [[Minnesota Axemen]], [[Portland Forest Dragons]] and [[Philadelphia Soul]]. Dialogue and team gear also indicates that he was a member of teams in [[Canada]], notably the [[Ottawa Redblacks]] and fictional [[Saskatoon]] Cold (\"Like the [[Miami Heat]]... only cold\").  He has also played on teams in [[Alaska]] and was a member of the [[Buffalo Bills]] practice squad. In the first episode of the series, Colt reveals that he was \"the back up to the back up to the back up\" for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] team that won the [[Bowl Championship Series|college football championship]] in 1999. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1\u20133), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for having to accept the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker. He has, however, been just as irresponsible as Colt, drinking too much and sleeping around. In the first half of Season 3, Rooster gets into hot water with Mary's intimidating boyfriend, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Much more lighthearted and caring than Beau, her company and advice is often sought out by the boys on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning their father. Maggie is something of a hippie and is an avid marijuana smoker.\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is difficult to get along with, perpetually annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He detests many modern amenities and is easily angered by his sons' antics. Beau appears to be a Republican with a special affinity for [[Ronald Reagan]] but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2\u20134; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him. As the series progresses, she breaks off her engagement to Kenny and ultimately marries Colt, having a baby girl, Peyton, down the line.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Dale Rivers, a hearing-impaired veterinarian and close friend of Beau's\n* Grady Lee Richmond as Hank, a regular Maggie's patron\n* [[Bret Harrison]] as Kenny Ballard, a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] manager and Abby's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Megyn Price]] as Mary Roth, a [[Cracker Barrel]] waitress and Rooster's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Kelli Goss]] as Heather Roth, Mary's younger daughter and Colt's ex-girlfriend, was pregnant with their child.\n* [[Molly McCook]] as Darlene Roth, Mary's older daughter\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Joanne, Beau's girlfriend and Mary's friend/coworker at the Cracker Barrel\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as \"Beer Pong\" Billy Tompkins, a police officer and high school friend of Colt and Rooster's.\n* Justin Mooney as Officer Wilkerson\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Nikki, Heather's friend and Billy's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Chasty Ballesteros]] as Tanya Showers, a sexy weather reporter and Kenny's current girlfriend\n* Laura Vallejo as Maria, a Maggie's waitress\n* [[Sharon Lawrence]] as Brenda Sanders, a widowed hairdresser who befriended Beau when he and Maggie separated\n* [[Maggie Lawson]] as Jen, an engineer who wants to build a pipeline underneath the Bennett Ranch and Rooster's love interest\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Lisa Neumann, owner of the Neumann's Hill ranching corporation\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Luke Matthews, the son of Beau's late brother Greg\n* [[Stephen Saux]] as Mike, a motel manager, first seen at the Thomas Rhett concert\n* Travis Case as Toby, Colt's high school classmate, who runs the neighboring Henderson Ranch\n*Josh Burrow as Nick, Mary\u2019s intimidating and abusive ex boyfriend, who runs Rooster out of town at gun point.

He returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence so that he can take part in a tryout with a semi-pro team, and decides to stay and help his father and older brother on their family ranch. Colt is frequently the butt of their jokes, particularly when it comes to his ranching skills (or lack thereof) and his disappointing pro football career.  He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense, but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue throughout the first season, it's implied that Colt has played for the [[Barcelona Dragons]], [[San Jose SaberCats]], [[Spokane Shock]], [[Orlando Predators]], [[Nebraska Danger]], [[Iowa Barnstormers]], [[Green Bay Blizzard]], [[Minnesota Axemen]], [[Portland Forest Dragons]] and [[Philadelphia Soul]]. Dialogue and team gear also indicates that he was a member of teams in [[Canada]], notably the [[Ottawa Redblacks]] and fictional [[Saskatoon]] Cold (\"Like the [[Miami Heat]]... only cold\").  He has also played on teams in [[Alaska]] and was a member of the [[Buffalo Bills]] practice squad. In the first episode of the series, Colt reveals that he was \"the back up to the back up to the back up\" for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] team that won the [[Bowl Championship Series|college football championship]] in 1999. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1\u20133), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for having to accept the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker. He has, however, been just as irresponsible as Colt, drinking too much and sleeping around. In the first half of Season 3, Rooster gets into hot water with Mary's intimidating boyfriend, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Much more lighthearted and caring than Beau, her company and advice is often sought out by the boys on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning their father. Maggie is something of a hippie and is an avid marijuana smoker.\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is difficult to get along with, perpetually annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He detests many modern amenities and is easily angered by his sons' antics. Beau appears to be a Republican with a special affinity for [[Ronald Reagan]] but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2\u20134; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him. As the series progresses, she breaks off her engagement to Kenny and ultimately marries Colt, having a baby girl, Peyton, down the line.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Dale Rivers, a hearing-impaired veterinarian and close friend of Beau's\n* Grady Lee Richmond as Hank, a regular Maggie's patron\n* [[Bret Harrison]] as Kenny Ballard, a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] manager and Abby's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Megyn Price]] as Mary Roth, a [[Cracker Barrel]] waitress and Rooster's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Kelli Goss]] as Heather Roth, Mary's younger daughter and Colt's ex-girlfriend, was pregnant with their child.\n* [[Molly McCook]] as Darlene Roth, Mary's older daughter\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Joanne, Beau's girlfriend and Mary's friend/coworker at the Cracker Barrel\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as \"Beer Pong\" Billy Tompkins, a police officer and high school friend of Colt and Rooster's.\n* Justin Mooney as Officer Wilkerson\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Nikki, Heather's friend and Billy's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Chasty Ballesteros]] as Tanya Showers, a sexy weather reporter and Kenny's current girlfriend\n* Laura Vallejo as Maria, a Maggie's waitress\n* [[Sharon Lawrence]] as Brenda Sanders, a widowed hairdresser who befriended Beau when he and Maggie separated\n* [[Maggie Lawson]] as Jen, an engineer who wants to build a pipeline underneath the Bennett Ranch and Rooster's love interest\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Lisa Neumann, owner of the Neumann's Hill ranching corporation\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Luke Matthews, the son of Beau's late brother Greg\n* [[Stephen Saux]] as Mike, a motel manager, first seen at the Thomas Rhett concert\n* Travis Case as Toby, Colt's high school classmate, who runs the neighboring Henderson Ranch\n*Josh Burrow as Nick, Mary\u2019s intimidating and abusive ex boyfriend, who runs Rooster out of town at gun point.

Heather trains as a veterinary technician and shadows Dale as he examines Colt's cows. Dale reports that Colt's bull is incapable of impregnating them, leaving Colt short of cash with no way to increase his herd. Colt declines Heather's request for help finding her mother and Luke.  Lisa Neumann argues with Beau about management of his ranch, which is now part of Neumann's Hill. Colt attempts to purchase a bull from Lisa, but she refuses to sell.

Colt denies Lisa\u2019s accusation that he stole a bull. Colt finds an open gate between his father\u2019s ranch and his, which allowed a bull onto Colt's.

Luke gives Heather $1,000 so she can pay the mortgage. Dale says Colt's sick cow is recovering after receiving epinephrine, revealing that Beau saved it by disregarding Colt's assessment of its condition. Abby works late, irritating Colt by denying him time with Peyton. Joanne counsels Colt that rather than be upset with Beau, he should be willing to listen to the advice of an experienced rancher. Heather tells Luke that Mary withdrew the money and fled, leaving nothing for the mortgage. Colt apologizes to Beau and says he should have been grateful for Beau\u2019s wisdom.

To Colt's irritation, Luke says he arrived late for work because he was searching for Mary. Luke says Colt's tractor has a cracked engine block, meaning expensive repairs. Despite his misgivings, Colt gives Luke suggestions for finding Mary. Joanne confesses to Beau that she turned down his proposal because she has early stage Alzheimer's disease and announces she is moving to Arizona to live with her daughter. Colt hits on the idea of crowdsourcing the sale of his cows, increasing profits by dealing directly with customers. Mary's family is evicted.  Mary is still missing, and took Heather's car, so Heather reports it stolen as a way to find her. Abby creates Colt's profile for the crowdsourcing website. Mary is arrested and Luke and Heather decline to post bail, hoping time in jail will restore her sobriety. Beau visits Joanne in Arizona and promises to stay with her no matter where she lives. Abby and Colt check the website and see several pre-orders for beef, indicating that crowdsourcing is viable. Happy at their success, they spend the night together.

Luke, Colt, and Beau find the stream is blocked by a Neumann's Hill dam. Dale tells Joanne that when Charlene was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, it motivated them to travel and do other activities they had long deferred. Lisa declines to remove the dam, saying her ranches need the water for alfalfa and other crops. Heather and Luke meet Mary at the bar to return the personal items they saved for her during the eviction, but Mary refuses to consider entering rehabilitation for her drug abuse. Based on Dale's advice, Joanne proposes and Beau accepts.

Jerry tells Colt that he and the other affected ranchers have a good case against the dam and he will ask a judge to issue an injunction against Neumann's Hill that prevents them from using it while the court case is pending. Joanne is frustrated when she believes her Alzheimer's symptoms may be affecting her memory. Abby suggests marriage counseling, but Colt refuses. Colt pleads with Lisa to remove the dam, but she refuses and promises to drag the court case out for so long that the affected ranchers will go out of business.

It was originally built in 398.\n\nIt is home to the [[Passionist]]s and is the burial place of [[St. Paul of the Cross]]. Additionally, it is the [[station church]] of the first Friday in [[Lent]].<ref name=va/>\n\n==History==\nThe church was built in 398, by [[Roman senate|senator]] [[Saint Pammachius|Pammachius]], over the home of two Roman soldiers, [[John and Paul]], martyred under the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in 362.  The church was thus called the ''Titulus Pammachii'' and is recorded as such in the acts of the synod held by [[Pope Symmachus]] in 499.<ref>[https://curate.nd.edu/show/9s16154719b \"Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome\", Curate ND]</ref>\n\nThe church was damaged during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack]] by [[Alaric I]] (410) and because of an earthquake (442), restored by [[Pope Paschal I]] (824), [[Sack of Rome (1084)|sacked again]] by the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] (1084), and again restored, with the addition of a monastery and a bell tower around 1099.<ref name=va>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/cult-martyrum/stazioni/descrizioni/vc_pa_martyrum_20030125_giovannipaolo_it.html \"Station to Saints John and Paul\", Vatican]</ref> \n\n==Interior==\nThe inside has three naves, with pillars joined to the original columns.

Among previous Cardinal Priests of this title are three who became Pope: [[Pope Honorius III]] (Cencio Savelli, elevated to cardinal in 1198), [[Pope Adrian VI]] (Adriaan Boeyens, elevated to cardinal in 1517) and [[Pope Pius XII]] (Eugenio Pacelli, elevated to cardinal in 1929). Since [[Francis Spellman]] became the new Cardinal Priest of the titulus in 1946 (after it had been vacated by Pacelli's election to the papacy in 1939), it was held until 2015 by cardinals who were [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archbishops of New York]]. In 2012, Archbishop [[Timothy Dolan]] of New York was elevated to cardinal and assigned a different title, because Cardinal [[Edward Egan]], the first prelate to enjoy the title of Archbishop Emeritus of New York, continued in the title of ''Ss.
