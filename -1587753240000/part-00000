Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them.

She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned, fugitive [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czech Resistance]] leader. They need the letters to escape to America to continue his work. German Major Strasser has come to Casablanca to see that Laszlo fails.\n\nWhen Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld figure and Rick's friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Privately, Rick refuses to sell at any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing {{lang|de|[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]}} (\"The Watch on the Rhine\"). Laszlo orders the house band to play {{lang|fr|[[La Marseillaise]]}}. When the band looks to Rick, he nods his head.

Laszlo, aware of Rick's love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety.\n\nWhen the police arrest Laszlo on a trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to [[Lisbon]] with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed\u2014\"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life\". Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone and Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene. As the police arrive, Renault pauses, then orders them to \"round up the usual suspects\".

AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, \"[''Casablanca''] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment.\"<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" />\n\nThe [[Library of Congress]] deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called the finished product \"state of the art\", it was mostly met with negative critical reception.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the ''[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]'' criticized the colorization, \"...&nbsp;''Casablanca'' in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor.\"<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> Bogart's son Stephen said, \"if you're going to colorize ''Casablanca'', why not put arms on the [[Venus de Milo]]?\"<ref name=\"harmetz342\"/>\n\n==Inaccuracies and a misquote==\nSeveral unfounded rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that [[Ronald Reagan]] was originally chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=74}}</ref> [[George Raft]] claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sklar|first=Robert|title=City Boys: Cagney, Bogart, Garfield|year=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-04795-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/cityboyscagneybo0000skla/page/135 135]|url=https://archive.org/details/cityboyscagneybo0000skla/page/135}}</ref>\n\nAnother story is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end. Koch later acknowledged: \n<blockquote>\nWhen we began, we didn't have a finished script&nbsp;... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know&nbsp;... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays/list |title=101 Greatest Screenplays |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, while rewrites did occur during filming, Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, according to critic [[Roger Ebert]], \"emotional\", not \"factual\".<ref name=\"Ebertcommentary\" />\n\nThe film has several logical flaws, one being the two \"letters of transit\" that enable their bearers to leave [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] territory. According to the {{Audio|Lettersoftransit.ogg|audio}}, Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either Vichy General [[Maxime Weygand|Weygand]] or [[Free French]] General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]. The French subtitles on the official DVD read Weygand; the English ones specify de Gaulle. Weygand had been the Vichy delegate-general for the [[French colonial empire|North African colonies]] until November 1941, a month before the film is set. But de Gaulle was the head of the Free French [[government in exile]], so a letter signed by him would have provided no benefit.<ref name=\"robertson\" /> The letters were invented as a [[MacGuffin]] by Joan Alison for the original play and never questioned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, \"This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault,\" Ebert points out, \"It makes no sense that he could walk around freely.&nbsp;... He would be arrested on sight.\"<ref name=\"Ebertcommentary\" /> In addition, no uniformed German troops were stationed in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918.<ref name=\"robertson\" />\n\nAccording to Harmetz, the usual route out of Germany, at least for people in the film industry, was not via Morocco and Lisbon but via Vienna, Prague, Paris and England. Only the film's technical adviser, Robert Aisner, traced the path to Morocco shown in the film's opening scene.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=208}}</ref>\n\nA line closely associated with ''Casablanca''\u2014\"Play it again, Sam\"\u2014is not spoken in the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie Misquotations |first=Fred R. |last=Shapiro |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217184411/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html |archivedate=December 17, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Darth Vader line is the daddy of film misquotes, finds poll |first=Ben |last=Child |newspaper=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=May 11, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115201651/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll |archivedate=November 15, 2016 }}</ref> When Ilsa first enters the Caf\u00e9 Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to \"Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake.\" After he feigns ignorance, she responds, \"Play it, Sam.

Spotting Rick's friend and house pianist, Sam, Ilsa asks him to play \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\". Rick storms over, furious that Sam disobeyed his order never to perform that song and is stunned to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned, fugitive [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czech Resistance]] leader. They need the letters to escape to America to continue his work. German Major Strasser has come to Casablanca to see that Laszlo fails.\n\nWhen Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld figure and Rick's friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Privately, Rick refuses to sell at any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing {{lang|de|[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]}} (\"The Watch on the Rhine\"). Laszlo orders the house band to play {{lang|fr|[[La Marseillaise]]}}. When the band looks to Rick, he nods his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Strasser demands Renault close the club, which he does on the pretext of suddenly discovering there is gambling on the premises.\n\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|alt=Black-and-white film screenshot of a man and woman as seen from the shoulders up.

When he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed her husband had been killed attempting to escape from a [[concentration camp]]. While preparing to flee with Rick from the imminent fall of the city during the [[Battle of France]], she learned Laszlo was alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to nurse her sick husband. Rick's bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, letting her believe she will stay with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick's love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety.\n\nWhen the police arrest Laszlo on a trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to [[Lisbon]] with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed\u2014\"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life\". Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone and Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene. As the police arrive, Renault pauses, then orders them to \"round up the usual suspects\". He suggests to Rick that they join the [[Free French]] in [[Brazzaville]]. As they walk away into the fog, Rick says, \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet in Casablanca crop.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|alt=Black-and-white film screenshot of two men, both wearing suits.

AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, \"[''Casablanca''] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment.\"<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" />\n\nThe [[Library of Congress]] deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called the finished product \"state of the art\", it was mostly met with negative critical reception.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the ''[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]'' criticized the colorization, \"...&nbsp;''Casablanca'' in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor.\"<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> Bogart's son Stephen said, \"if you're going to colorize ''Casablanca'', why not put arms on the [[Venus de Milo]]?\"<ref name=\"harmetz342\"/>\n\n==Inaccuracies and a misquote==\nSeveral unfounded rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that [[Ronald Reagan]] was originally chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=74}}</ref> [[George Raft]] claimed that he had turned down the lead role.

Koch later acknowledged: \n<blockquote>\nWhen we began, we didn't have a finished script&nbsp;... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know&nbsp;... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays/list |title=101 Greatest Screenplays |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, while rewrites did occur during filming, Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, according to critic [[Roger Ebert]], \"emotional\", not \"factual\".<ref name=\"Ebertcommentary\" />\n\nThe film has several logical flaws, one being the two \"letters of transit\" that enable their bearers to leave [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] territory. According to the {{Audio|Lettersoftransit.ogg|audio}}, Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either Vichy General [[Maxime Weygand|Weygand]] or [[Free French]] General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]. The French subtitles on the official DVD read Weygand; the English ones specify de Gaulle. Weygand had been the Vichy delegate-general for the [[French colonial empire|North African colonies]] until November 1941, a month before the film is set. But de Gaulle was the head of the Free French [[government in exile]], so a letter signed by him would have provided no benefit.<ref name=\"robertson\" /> The letters were invented as a [[MacGuffin]] by Joan Alison for the original play and never questioned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, \"This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault,\" Ebert points out, \"It makes no sense that he could walk around freely.&nbsp;... He would be arrested on sight.\"<ref name=\"Ebertcommentary\" /> In addition, no uniformed German troops were stationed in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918.<ref name=\"robertson\" />\n\nAccording to Harmetz, the usual route out of Germany, at least for people in the film industry, was not via Morocco and Lisbon but via Vienna, Prague, Paris and England. Only the film's technical adviser, Robert Aisner, traced the path to Morocco shown in the film's opening scene.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=208}}</ref>\n\nA line closely associated with ''Casablanca''\u2014\"Play it again, Sam\"\u2014is not spoken in the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie Misquotations |first=Fred R. |last=Shapiro |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217184411/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html |archivedate=December 17, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Darth Vader line is the daddy of film misquotes, finds poll |first=Ben |last=Child |newspaper=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=May 11, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115201651/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll |archivedate=November 15, 2016 }}</ref> When Ilsa first enters the Caf\u00e9 Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to \"Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake.\" After he feigns ignorance, she responds, \"Play it, Sam.

It is Yugi's message to the Pharaoh that \"Those of the dead should not remain in the world of the living.\" Yugi finally defeats Atem, but immediately collapses on his knees, crying. Despite Atem telling Yugi that he shouldn't cry, Yugi tells Atem that he (Yugi) is a coward, and that Atem was always his goal. Atem comforts Yugi, saying that he isn't a coward; instead, Yugi's victory has finally set him free. Atem then departs into the afterlife, while Yugi and his friends begin a new journey. Then, the Millennium Stone shatters, which causes the seven Millennium Items to fall into the pit left behind. Also, the shrine collapses, and Shadi's spirit is seen here one last time. Everybody barely makes it out in time. As a result of the shrine's destruction, the Millennium Items are buried forever. Then, Yugi tells Joey that, \"Sometimes, the end of one adventure is only beginning of another.\" This concludes the end of the 4-Kids version of the story.\n\nIn the extended ending (only in the original Japanese version), Yugi, Tea, Joey, Tristan, Bakura, Duke, Grandpa, Kaiba and Mokuba all leave Egypt and return to Domino City of Japan. In the airport, they meet up with Rebecca, Arthur, and Serenity. Both Duke and Tristan run towards Serenity, only to be pulled back by Joey. Rebecca hugs Yugi, much to Tea's annoyance. Weevil Underwood and Rex Raptor get into an argument again and decide to duel. Zigfried and Leon von Schroeder make a business proposition with Pegasus, to which he agrees. Mako Tsunami returns from a fishing trip, and he meets Espa and the Roba brothers at the harbor. Espa Roba starts his duel disk, intimating that a duel is about to take place. Mai Valentine and Vivian Wong are facing off in a two-on-two duel against the Paradox Brothers atop the Great Wall of China. The credits end with a cutscene where Grandpa is sweeping, while Yugi comes out from the house to join Tea, Joey, and Tristan to go to school. Yugi ends the show by saying that his story has not ended, and that his story extends beyond that of the Pharaoh, who after 5,000 years defeated the evil Zorc Necrophades (as well as the Great Leviathan).\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:2003 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:2004 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|Duel Monsters (season 5)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox television season\n| season_name      = ''Yu-Gi-Oh!

Yami Bakura tells the Pharaoh that the only way to regain his memory is to play a game (the Ultimate Shadow Game) before departing. Then, Yami Bakura kidnaps Mokuba and sends his soul to the Shadow Realm, which forces Kaiba to duel him. Yami Bakura turns the duel into a Shadow Game, and tells Kaiba that if he wins, then he will return Mokuba's soul. Planning to claim the great power of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon as his own, and to have Kaiba join ''\"The Ultimate Shadow Game\"'', Bakura attacks using a new deck of Egyptian-themed cards, including his \"tablet\" trap cards, and his spirit beast, Diabound Kernel.

Yami Bakura's departure into the past causes the spirits of Rex Raptor, Weevil Underwood, and Mokuba to be released from the Shadow Realm (not shown on screen). Later, Yami Bakura completely takes over the body of his ancient alter ego, ''Bakura the Thief King'', and frees him from his guards. Soon, his minions arrive, and free him from his chains. Then, Thief King Bakura (now under the control of Yami Bakura) raids the previous Pharaoh's tomb and heads off to the royal palace to claim the seven Millennium Items.\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Mahad draws upon his Millennium Ring to completely unearth his full powers, which he had sealed away within the academy for his own safety. Mahad's Illusion Magician faces off against Bakura's Diabound, which has grown in strength since his battle with the Pharaoh. However, Mahad's Illusion Magician has also grown in strength since then, but Bakura's Diabound is still the strongest monster on the field. Diabound gains the upper hand, and Thief King Bakura finishes the job by deliberately setting off the tomb's traps. To save himself, Mahad fuses his soul with his spirit beast, the Illusion Magician, transforming himself into the Dark Magician, which made him much more powerful than Bakura's Diabound, much to Bakura's disbelief. Bakura the Thief takes the Millennium Ring, however, Mahad as Dark Magician is able to destroy Bakura's Diabound, which causes the cavern to collapse.

Shada locates Diabound's stone tablet and plans to destroy it to eliminate the beast. However, Aknadin attacks him and takes the Millennium Key. Shada is dragged into Diabound's tablet by the spirits of Kul Elna. Diabound's attacks overwhelm the Pharaoh and his Guardians. As Diabound defeats them, the Pharaoh tries to surrender himself to the souls of Kul Elna.

Aknamkanon is able to trap the angry spirits within him, which releases Shada from Diabound's tablet, and leads the spirits to the Shadow Realm (trapping himself there as well). Bakura becomes enrages as the loss of the spirits weakens Diabound. Mahad is finally able to defeat Diabound with help from the Pharaoh.

Later, the Pharaoh entrusts the Millennium Items to the revived Priest Seto and makes him the next Pharaoh of Egypt. With his role in the past over, Atem's body dissolves even as Priest Seto promises to rule Egypt justly. Atem and his friends leave the Memory World.\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}} \n{{Episode table/part|p=The Final Duel |c=#006800 |nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Pharaoh Atem and Yugi then separate into two physical beings. The duel that will determine the fate of Atem and Yugi begin. Pharaoh Atem summons \"The Tricky\" with an attack power of 2000 but Yugi plays the magic card, \"Swords of Revealing Light\". Yugi is able to fuse the three monsters: \"Green Gadget\", \"Red Gadget\", and \"Yellow Gadget\" into one monster with 3000 attack points: the \"Mobile Fortress Stronghold\".\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Atem summons the three gods: Ra, Obelisk and Slifer to the field. The sum of their attack power exceeds ten thousand. Yugi is overwhelmed, but he parries Slifer's Summon Thunder Bullet with this episode's Key Point: a Quick Spell card, \"Mirage Magic.\" When a player's monsters' Attack Power and Defense Power increase or decrease due to an opponent's card, this negates the effect and recovers the difference in Life Points. Furthermore, Yugi also dodges Obelisk's attack with the Trap card \"Mirage Ruler.\" Yugi finally makes a counterattack move that threatens the Egyptian Gods.\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Now, Yugi must face his most trusted creature, the Dark Magician, if he wants to help Atem. (Note: When this aired in the U.S, the ending said \"To Be Concluded\" instead of \"To Be Continued\", thus signifying the end of the series.)\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Yugi was finally able to defeat the \"Dark Magician\" with his \"Silent Magician.\" Atem tries to activate the Spell card Monster Reborn so he can revive Slifer the Sky Dragon, but when Yugi opens the Gold Sarcophagus to reveal the card he sealed, the card was \"Monster Reborn\". It means neither of them can use that card in this game. It is Yugi's message to the Pharaoh that \"Those of the dead should not remain in the world of the living.\" Yugi finally defeats Atem, but immediately collapses on his knees, crying. Despite Atem telling Yugi that he shouldn't cry, Yugi tells Atem that he (Yugi) is a coward, and that Atem was always his goal. Atem comforts Yugi, saying that he isn't a coward; instead, Yugi's victory has finally set him free. Atem then departs into the afterlife, while Yugi and his friends begin a new journey. Then, the Millennium Stone shatters, which causes the seven Millennium Items to fall into the pit left behind. Also, the shrine collapses, and Shadi's spirit is seen here one last time. Everybody barely makes it out in time. As a result of the shrine's destruction, the Millennium Items are buried forever. Then, Yugi tells Joey that, \"Sometimes, the end of one adventure is only beginning of another.\" This concludes the end of the 4-Kids version of the story.\n\nIn the extended ending (only in the original Japanese version), Yugi, Tea, Joey, Tristan, Bakura, Duke, Grandpa, Kaiba and Mokuba all leave Egypt and return to Domino City of Japan. In the airport, they meet up with Rebecca, Arthur, and Serenity. Both Duke and Tristan run towards Serenity, only to be pulled back by Joey. Rebecca hugs Yugi, much to Tea's annoyance. Weevil Underwood and Rex Raptor get into an argument again and decide to duel. Zigfried and Leon von Schroeder make a business proposition with Pegasus, to which he agrees. Mako Tsunami returns from a fishing trip, and he meets Espa and the Roba brothers at the harbor. Espa Roba starts his duel disk, intimating that a duel is about to take place. Mai Valentine and Vivian Wong are facing off in a two-on-two duel against the Paradox Brothers atop the Great Wall of China. The credits end with a cutscene where Grandpa is sweeping, while Yugi comes out from the house to join Tea, Joey, and Tristan to go to school. Yugi ends the show by saying that his story has not ended, and that his story extends beyond that of the Pharaoh, who after 5,000 years defeated the evil Zorc Necrophades (as well as the Great Leviathan).\n| LineColor       = 006800\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:2003 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:2004 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|Duel Monsters (season 5)]]\n", "name_user": "Favre1fan93", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters_(season_5)"}

Soon after joining, Worker Ant became the group's mouthpiece, as he spoke for them in their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promos]].\n\nThe Colony would become one of the more prominent acts in Chikara in 2007 due to increasingly entertaining and innovative matches as a trio, and a heated feud with the ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' [[The Blackout (professional wrestling)|BLKOUT]], a feud which the Colony would win in September with a decisive victory on the Cibernetico undercard.\n\n====Feud with The UnStable (2008\u20132009)====\n[[File:Fire Ant on turnbuckles.jpg|thumb|Fire Ant in 2008]]\nBeginning in 2008, Fire Ant once again began competing semi-regularly as a singles wrestler and began a heated feud with former ally Equinox, who had since unmasked himself and began competing under his real name, Vin Gerard. \n\nAt the Young Lions Cup tournament on June 15, Fire Ant defeated Gerard for the Cup in a match that garnered significant praise from both the company and fans. However, the following month on July 13, Gerard gained revenge by defeating Fire Ant in a rematch for the Cup after utilizing the cup itself as a weapon, resulting in Fire Ant having the shortest title reign in Chikara history. Soon after the loss, Gerard successfully managed to manipulate ''technico'' [[Stigma (wrestler)|Shane Storm]] into aligning with him, effectively renaming him STIGMA. Gerard and STIGMA would feud with The Colony until September 7, when the two aligned with the returning [[Colin Delaney]] to form the UnStable, and thus evening the numbers of both groups. \n\nAt the [[Tag World Grand Prix#2008|2008 Tag World Grand Prix]], Fire Ant and Soldier Ant represented The Colony as the stable made its second appearance in the tournament. The Colony would go on to defeat the Fight Club in the opening round, the UnStable in the semi-finals and both [[The Osirian Portal]] and [[Martin Stone (wrestler)|Martin Stone]] and [[Pac (wrestler)|Pac]] in the finals to win the tournament.\n\nNow with a staggering seven points towards Campeonatos de Parejas contention, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant issued their challenge to the reigning Campeones The Osirian Portal for January 25, 2009. Owing to the number of points they accumulated, Director of Fun Leonard F. Chikarason allowed the Colony to choose their own stipulations for the match. They decreed that the match would be one fall instead of the conventional two-out-of-three falls, and the Portal's third member, Escorpion Egipcio, would be banned from ringside. Despite the stipulations, the Colony failed to win the title.\n\n====Rebuilding and Campeonatos de Parejas (2009\u20132010)====\nOn February 20, the Colony lost to [[The Kings of Wrestling|Team F.I.S.T.]] ([[Icarus (wrestler)|Icarus]], [[Gran Akuma]] and [[Chuck Taylor (wrestler)|Chuck Taylor]]) after Worker Ant was pinned by Icarus. After the match, Taylor performed his ''[[Chuck Taylor (wrestler)#In wrestling|Awful Waffle]]'' on Worker Ant onto the floor outside the ring, resulting in Worker Ant suffering ([[kayfabe]]) cranial injuries. Soon after the attack, a fourth Ant, later identified as Green Ant, made his debut to help tend to the injured Worker Ant.<ref name=WorkerRetires>{{cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?p=2888|title=Worker Ant retires from wrestling|work=Chikara Fans}}</ref> It was then announced on Chikara's website that Worker Ant retired from wrestling due to the severity of his injuries and that Green Ant would fill in for his absence.<ref name=WorkerRetires/> On May 24, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, with Green Ant in their corner, defeated Icarus and Chuck Taylor in a [[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Mask vs. Hair]] match, resulting in Icarus and Taylor having their heads shaved.

Soon after joining, Worker Ant became the group's mouthpiece, as he spoke for them in their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promos]].\n\nThe Colony would become one of the more prominent acts in Chikara in 2007 due to increasingly entertaining and innovative matches as a trio, and a heated feud with the ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' [[The Blackout (professional wrestling)|BLKOUT]], a feud which the Colony would win in September with a decisive victory on the Cibernetico undercard.\n\n====Feud with The UnStable (2008\u20132009)====\n[[File:Fire Ant on turnbuckles.jpg|thumb|Fire Ant in 2008]]\nBeginning in 2008, Fire Ant once again began competing semi-regularly as a singles wrestler and began a heated feud with former ally Equinox, who had since unmasked himself and began competing under his real name, Vin Gerard. \n\nAt the Young Lions Cup tournament on June 15, Fire Ant defeated Gerard for the Cup in a match that garnered significant praise from both the company and fans. However, the following month on July 13, Gerard gained revenge by defeating Fire Ant in a rematch for the Cup after utilizing the cup itself as a weapon, resulting in Fire Ant having the shortest title reign in Chikara history. Soon after the loss, Gerard successfully managed to manipulate ''technico'' [[Stigma (wrestler)|Shane Storm]] into aligning with him, effectively renaming him STIGMA. Gerard and STIGMA would feud with The Colony until September 7, when the two aligned with the returning [[Colin Delaney]] to form the UnStable, and thus evening the numbers of both groups. \n\nAt the [[Tag World Grand Prix#2008|2008 Tag World Grand Prix]], Fire Ant and Soldier Ant represented The Colony as the stable made its second appearance in the tournament. The Colony would go on to defeat the Fight Club in the opening round, the UnStable in the semi-finals and both [[The Osirian Portal]] and [[Martin Stone (wrestler)|Martin Stone]] and [[Pac (wrestler)|Pac]] in the finals to win the tournament.\n\nNow with a staggering seven points towards Campeonatos de Parejas contention, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant issued their challenge to the reigning Campeones The Osirian Portal for January 25, 2009. Owing to the number of points they accumulated, Director of Fun Leonard F. Chikarason allowed the Colony to choose their own stipulations for the match. They decreed that the match would be one fall instead of the conventional two-out-of-three falls, and the Portal's third member, Escorpion Egipcio, would be banned from ringside. Despite the stipulations, the Colony failed to win the title.\n\n====Rebuilding and Campeonatos de Parejas (2009\u20132010)====\nOn February 20, the Colony lost to [[The Kings of Wrestling|Team F.I.S.T.]] ([[Icarus (wrestler)|Icarus]], [[Gran Akuma]] and [[Chuck Taylor (wrestler)|Chuck Taylor]]) after Worker Ant was pinned by Icarus. After the match, Taylor performed his ''[[Chuck Taylor (wrestler)#In wrestling|Awful Waffle]]'' on Worker Ant onto the floor outside the ring, resulting in Worker Ant suffering ([[kayfabe]]) cranial injuries. Soon after the attack, a fourth Ant, later identified as Green Ant, made his debut to help tend to the injured Worker Ant.<ref name=WorkerRetires>{{cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?p=2888|title=Worker Ant retires from wrestling|work=Chikara Fans}}</ref> It was then announced on Chikara's website that Worker Ant retired from wrestling due to the severity of his injuries and that Green Ant would fill in for his absence.<ref name=WorkerRetires/> On May 24, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, with Green Ant in their corner, defeated Icarus and Chuck Taylor in a [[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Mask vs. Hair]] match, resulting in Icarus and Taylor having their heads shaved. When Gran Akuma attempted to interfere in the closing moments of the match, a new brown-colored Ant, Carpenter Ant, ran out to ringside to fend off Akuma's attack.<ref name=AniversarioYang>{{cite web|url=http://nationalsportsreview.com/sports/us/pwp/2009/06/10/dvd-reviews-chikara-aniversario-yang/|title=DVD Reviews - CHIKARA 'Aniversario Yang'}}</ref> During Chikara's June tour of [[Big Japan Pro Wrestling]], Kazuhiko Miyakami wore the costume of Green Ant after it was stolen by Chuck Taylor.<ref name=\"Green Ant\">{{cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=2907|title=Green Ant at Chikarafans.com}}</ref> The real Green Ant made his wrestling debut on July 31, 2009, in a six-man tag team match, where The Colony defeated The Order of the Neo-Solar Temple ([[UltraMantis Black]], [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]] and Crossbones).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=4301|title=\"Never Kneel at the Altar of Conformity\" \u2013 7/31/2009|accessdate=2010-03-14|date=2009-08-01|work=Chikara Fans}}</ref> Fire Ant and Soldier Ant acquired two more points over the next few months and challenged the Osirian Portal for the Campeonatos de Parejas again on September 13 at Hiding in Plain Sight.

His popular moves include \"the kicks of doom\" where he raises his arms high in the air before putting the in his pockets, he then lethargically kicks his opponents shin before doing a slow superkick on the shin. Usually the crowd acts like every kick is a devastating kick yet they are just gentle, lazy kicks to the shin  Another move is where he performs a suicide dive with his hands in his pockets. Most of his moves are done with his hands in his pockets.\n\nHe rarely speaks and on his way to the ring he poses with a lazy thumbs up with only half of his thumb sticking up.

In Europe, it was released for Windows on June 20, 2003, and the GameCube and Xbox on March 4, 2005. A [[PlayStation 2]] version was also planned, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. The game was released for Windows in the United States on September 22, 2003. A mobile port of the game was released worldwide for the iOS and Android on May 25, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nWoody is an average man who has a happy life, until his neighbor Mr. Rottweiler makes his life miserable. Woody decides to take full revenge on Mr. Rottweiler and calls to TV crew, which produces title [[reality show]] that shows the neighbor's relations form worst site.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn the game, the player plays as Woody, who creeps around the Rottweiler's house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. Woody is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game's objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called ''Chilli'', both of whom will try to alert the neighbour of Woody's presence. If Woody is caught by the Rottweiler, he is shown being brutally beaten and it is implied that Woody will be beaten to death. Then the episode is failed and player must restart the level.\n\nEach level's goal is to play some crude tricks on your neighbor by using every item near the player's character. Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (not including the training stages). Woody must move from zone to zone, as well as hide under the bed and in wardrobe to avoid caught. The neighbor moves in the house by his own routine, which can be disrupted in different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (for example, painting, washing clothes and so on). The game starts with only few rooms (the hall, bathroom, kitchen and the living room), but as the game progresses, more rooms are unlocked (in Season 2 is the balcony and bedroom, and in Season 3 is the basement and study), making the game more difficult.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 69/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/neighbors-from-hell|title=Neighbors from Hell for PC Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref><br />(Xbox) 49/100<ref name=MCXB>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/neighborsfromhell|title=Neighbours From Hell (xbx: 2005): Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=[[CNET]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913102810/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/neighborsfromhell|archivedate=September 13, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref><br />(GC) 41/100<ref name=MCGC>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/neighbors-from-hell|title=Neighbors From Hell for GameCube Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| CGM = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Review: Neighbors from Hell|magazine=[[Computer Games Magazine]]|publisher=[[theGlobe.com]]|issue=158|date=January 2004|page=76}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Del Sol|first=Arcadian|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_234.pdf|title=Neighbors From Hell|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|issue=234|date=January 2004|page=114|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040113101234/http://www.computergaming.com/article2/0,4364,1396253,00.asp|archivedate=January 13, 2004|url-status=live|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Martin|date=July 30, 2003|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_neighboursfromhell_pc|title=Neighbours From Hell (PC)|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=[[Gamer Network]]|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Colayco|first=Bob|date=September 23, 2003|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neighbors-from-hell-review/1900-6075608/|title=Neighbors From Hell Review (PC)|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Harker|first=Carla|date=October 23, 2003|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/neighbors-from-hell/6298p1.html|title=GameSpy: Neighbors From Hell (PC)|website=[[GameSpy]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| IGN = 7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Blevins|first=Tal|date=October 1, 2003|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/02/neighbors-from-hell-review|title=Neighbors from Hell Review (PC)|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 70%<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Saltzman|first=Marc|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/neighbors_from.html|title=Neighbors From Hell|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|volume=10|issue=11|date=November 2003|page=126|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315142254/http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/neighbors_from.html|archivedate=March 15, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| XPlay = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Hudak|first=Chris|date=October 23, 2003|url=http://www.techtv.com/xplay/reviews/story/0,24330,3549000,00.html|title='Neighbors From Hell' (PC) Review|website=[[X-Play]]|publisher=[[TechTV]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031023210119/http://www.techtv.com/xplay/reviews/story/0,24330,3549000,00.html|archivedate=October 23, 2003|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]''\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Saltzman|first=Marc|date=September 2, 2003|url=http://cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/090203_nfh.html|title=Neighbors from Hell (PC)|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330175729/http://cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/090203_nfh.html|archivedate=March 30, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe PC version received \"average\" reviews, while the GameCube and Xbox versions received \"generally unfavorable reviews\", according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggeregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=MCPC/><ref name=MCXB/><ref name=MCGC/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation}}\nIn 2004 a sequel was released, called ''[[Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation]]''.
