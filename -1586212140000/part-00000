The [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) had stopped running independent presidential candidates and consequently the term party in the SPA's name had confused the public. Replacing Socialist with Social Democrats, SDUSA clarified its vision to Americans who confused social democracy with the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] which SDUSA opposes.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html?_r=0|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn response, former SPA Co-Chairman [[Michael Harrington]] resigned from SDUSA in 1973 and founded the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) which criticized SDUSA's [[anti-communism]] and welcomed the [[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics movement]] associated with [[George McGovern]] and the [[New Left]].<ref name=\"Bloodworth147\">{{harvtxt|Bloodworth|2013|p=147}}</ref> SDUSA members opposed McGovern's politics and a few of them helped to start the [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]] and such members have been called [[Henry M. Jackson|Scoop Jackson]] Democrats or [[neoconservatives]], or both. SDUSA's members had been active in the [[civil rights movement]] which had been led since the 1940s by [[A. Philip Randolph]]. SDUSA's leaders had organized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], during which [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivered his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. Under the leadership of Randolph and [[Bayard Rustin]], SDUSA championed Rustin's [[Bayard Rustin#From Protest to Politics|emphasis on economic inequality]] as the most important issue facing African Americans after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. SDUSA's efforts to reduce [[Economic inequality in the United States|economic inequality]] led to a focus on labor unions and economic policy. As a result, SDUSA members were active in the [[AFL\u2013CIO]] confederation as well as in individual unions, especially the [[American Federation of Teachers]].\n\nSDUSA's electoral strategy of [[political realignment]] intended to organize labor unions, civil rights organizations and other constituencies into a coalition that would transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party. The realignment strategy emphasized working with unions and especially the AFL\u2013CIO, putting an emphasis on economic issues that would unite working class voters. SDUSA opposed the New Politics of Senator McGovern which had lost all states other than Massachusetts to [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], when Americans voted for a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1972 United States House of Representatives elections|House elections]]. While SDUSA had endorsed McGovern, it had adopted resolutions criticizing the New Politics for having made criticisms of [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] and [[Working class in the United States|working class]] Americans and for its advocacy of an immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\nSDUSA's organizational activities included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers\u2014it was known mainly because of its members' activities in other organizations. It included civil rights activists and leaders of labor unions such as Bayard Rustin, [[Norman Hill]] and [[Tom Kahn]] of the AFL\u2013CIO as well as [[Sandra Feldman]] and [[Rachelle Horowitz]] of the AFT. Kahn organized the AFL\u2013CIO's support of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], an [[Independent union|independent labor union]] that challenged the [[Polish People's Republic]].<ref name=\"Shevis32\">{{harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=32}}</ref> [[Penn Kemble]] and [[Carl Gershman]] cooperated with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administrations on [[democracy promotion]], beginning with the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. Other members included the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher [[Sidney Hook]]. SDUSA ceased operations in 2005 following the death of Penn Kemble. In 2008\u20132009, two small organizations emerged, each proclaiming itself to be the successor to SDUSA.\n\nSDUSA's politics were criticized by former SPA Chairman [[Michael Harrington]], who in 1972 announced that he favored an immediate pull-out of American forces from Vietnam (without requiring any guarantees). After losing all votes at the 1972 convention that changed the SPA to SDUSA, Harrington resigned in 1973 and formed his [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) which welcomed the New Politics and middle-class leadership.<ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/><ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\">\"The new strata of the issue-oriented and college-educated who provided the mass bass for [the McGovern Campaign] were, and are, extremely important to the creation of a new majority for change in this country.\"Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> The name change and the formation of DSOC represented a split with the [[socialist movement in the United States]].

Philip Randolph]], the [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] and [[Trade union|labor union]] leader; and with [[Michael Harrington]], the author of ''[[The Other America]]''. Even before the 1972 convention, Harrington had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the SPA<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> \"because he was upset about the group\u2019s failure to enthusiastically support [[George McGovern]] and because of its views on the [[Vietnam War]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GZM2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=social+democrats+usa&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TgNWVceQPO3hsAT5n4CICA&ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=social%20democrats%20usa&f=false Richard D.

''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored [[Darlington Hoopes]] as [[1956 United States presidential election|candidate for President in 1956]] and who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the SPA no longer sponsored party candidates in elections, continued use of the name \"party\" was \"misleading\" and hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party according to the majority report. The name \"Socialist\" was replaced by \"Social Democrats\" because many American associated the term \"[[Democratic socialism|socialism]]\" with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Moreover, the organization sought to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].<ref name=\"NYT27\">{{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=7&st=p}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1972 Convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one. The Convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for the Coalition Caucus of Harrington, two for the left-wing Debs Caucus and one for the independent [[Samuel H.

On foreign policy, the program called for \"firmness toward Communist aggression\". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed \"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect communist political cadres in [[South Vietnam]] from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for a [[ceasefire]] and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|immediate withdrawal]] of American forces was defeated.<!-- A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), [[Carl Gershman]] introduced the international program that was approved. --><ref name=\"NYT73\"/> Harrington complained that after its convention the SPA had endorsed [[George McGovern]] only with a statement loaded with \"constructive criticism\" and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern.

The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin's article \"From Protest to Politics\" in which Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. The needs of the black community demanded a shift in political strategy, where blacks would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like) to pursue a common economic agenda. It was time to move from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.<ref name=\"RustinFPTP\"/> A particular danger facing the black community was the chimera of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of [[Black Power]] which Rustin dismissed as a fantasy of middle-class African-Americans that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] while alienating the white allies needed by the black community.<ref name=\"RustinSeparatism\"/>\n\nSDUSA documents had similar criticisms of the agendas advanced by middle class activists increasing their role in the Democratic Party. SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated role of middle-class [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace activists]] in the Democratic Party, particularly associated with the \"New Politics\" of Senator [[George McGovern]], whose [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|presidential candidacy]] was viewed as an ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the United States.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/> In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.<ref name=\"NYT74\"/>\n\nIn foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing]] of [[North Vietnam]]. They demanded a negotiated peace treaty to end the [[Vietnam War]], but the majority opposed a unilateral withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, suggesting that such a withdrawal would lead to an annihilation of the free labor unions and of the political opposition.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref>These positions had been advanced by organizations like \"[[Penn Kemble#Negotiations Now!|Negotiations Now!]]\" since the 1960s.</ref><ref name=\"Gershman\">{{cite journal|last=Gershman|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Gershman|title=Totalitarian menace (Controversies: Detente and the left after Afghanistan)|journal=Society|date=3 November 1980|issn=0147-2011|pages=9\u201315|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF02694835}}</ref> After the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam and the victory of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Viet Cong]], SDUSA supported humanitarian assistance to refugees and condemned Senator McGovern for his failure to support such assistance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The View from Washington|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=6|number=2|date=November\u2013December 1978|pages=134\u2013135|jstor=30171704|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/00927678.1978.10553935}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Carl|last=Gershman|url=https://archive.org/details/AfterTheDominoesFell|title=After the dominoes fell|journal=Commentary|date=May 1978|series=SD papers|volume=3|ref=harv|authorlink=Carl Gershman}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational activities ==\n[[File:BayardRustinAug1963-LibraryOfCongress crop.jpg|thumb|upright|National Chairman [[Bayard Rustin]], who headed SDUSA]]\nSDUSA was governed by biannual conventions which invited the participation of interested observers.

[[A.&nbsp;Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Norman Hill]] were leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]. [[Tom Kahn]], [[Sandra Feldman]] and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and [[Penn Kemble]] served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] was a [[public intellectual]]. Writing after the death of [[Tom Kahn]], [[Ben Wattenberg]] commented that SDUSA as an \"umbrella organization\" associated with other [[letterhead organization]]s, saying the following: <blockquote>[SDUSA members seemed to be] ingeniously trying to bury the Soviet Union in a blizzard of letterheads. It seemed that each of Tom's colleagues\u2014Penn Kemble, Carl Gershman, Josh Muravchik and many more\u2014ran a little organization, each with the same interlocking directorate listed on the stationery. Funny thing: The Letterhead Lieutenants did indeed churn up a blizzard, and the Soviet Union is no more.\n\nI never did quite get all the organizational acronyms straight\u2014YPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISL\u2014but the key words were \"democratic\", \"labor\", \"young\" and, until events redefined it away from their understanding, \"socialist\". Ultimately, the umbrella group became \"Social Democrats, U.S.A\", and Tom Kahn was a principal \"theoretician\".\n\nThey talked and wrote endlessly, mostly about communism and democracy, despising the former, adoring the latter. It is easy today to say \"anti-communist\" and \"pro-democracy\" in the same breath. But that is because American foreign policy eventually became just such a mixture, thanks in part to those \"Yipsels\" (Young People's Socialist League), with Tom Kahn as provocateur-at-large.\n\nOn the conservative side, foreign policy used to be anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but nervous about being anti-communist. Tom theorized that to be either, you had to be both.\n\nIt was tough for labor-liberal intellectuals to be \"anti-communist\" in the 1970s. It meant being taunted as \"Cold Warriors\" who saw \"Commies under every bed\" and being labeled as\u2014the unkindest cut\u2014\"right-wingers\".<ref name=\"Wattenberg\">{{cite news|date=April 22, 1992|first=Ben|last=Wattenberg|authorlink=Ben Wattenberg|title=A man whose ideas helped change the world|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 November 2011|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-04-22/news/1992113044_1_tom-kahn-foreign-policy-anti-communist|id=Syndicated: (Thursday April 23, 1993). \"[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110504812 Remembering a man who mattered]\".

Philip Randolph came to national attention as the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]. Randolph proposed a march on Washington, D.C. to protest racial discrimination in the United States armed forces. Meeting with [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[Oval Office]], Randolph respectfully, politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that blacks would march in the capital unless desegregation would occur. The planned march was canceled after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the [[Fair Employment Act]]), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.\n\nIn 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]] to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, in war industries, in government agencies and in labor unions.&nbsp;Following the act, during the [[Philadelphia Transit Strike]] of 1944 the government backed African American workers' striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.\n\nIn 1947, Randolph, along with colleague [[Grant Reynolds (civil rights leader)|Grant Reynolds]], renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]].&nbsp; On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] abolished [[racial segregation]] in the armed forces through [[Executive Order 9981]].<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|title=Labor Hall of Fame Honoree (1989): A.

This article stated that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. To pursue its economic agenda, the black community needed to shift political strategy, strengthening its political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like). As its agenda shifted from civil rights to economic justice, the black community's tactics needed to shift from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.<ref name=RustinFPTP>Rustin wrote the following reports:\n* ''Civil rights: the true frontier'' New York, N.Y.: Donald Press, 1963\n* ''From protest to politics: the future of the civil rights movement'' New York: League for Industrial Democracy, 1965\n* ''The labor-Negro coalition, a new beginning'' [Washington?

Philip Randolph Institute, 1970</ref>\n\n===== Influence on William Julius Wilson =====\nRustin's analysis was supported by the later research by [[William Julius Wilson]].<ref name=\"RKRustin\"/> Wilson documented an increase in inequality within the black community, following educated blacks moving into white suburbs and following the decrease of demand for low-skill labor as industry declined in the Northern United States. Such economic problems were not being addressed by a civil rights leadership focused on \"[[affirmative action]]\", a policy benefiting the truly advantaged within the black community. Wilson's criticism of the neglect of working class and poor African Americans by civil rights organizations led to his being mistaken for a conservative, despite his having identified himself as a Rustin-style social democrat. Wilson has served on the advisory board of Social Democrats, USA.<ref>Wilson's ''The Declining Significance of Race'' won the [[American Sociological Association]]'s [[Sydney Spivack Award]]. In ''The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions'' (1978), [[Split labor market theory|Wilson]] argues that the significance of race is waning, and an African-American's class is comparatively more important in determining his or her life chances. His ''The Truly Disadvantaged'', which was selected by the editors of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received ''The Washington Monthly'' Annual Book Award and the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award. In ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy'' (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the \"[[spatial mismatch]]\" theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global [[economic restructuring]], and hence urban [[unemployment]] increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children, since the fathers would not be breadwinners. His ''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'', which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of ''The New York Times Book Review'' and received the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award. His ''The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics'' reaffirms the need for a coalition strategy, as Rustin suggested. In Wilson's most recent book, ''More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City'' (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans. He asks the question, \"Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?\" In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education. Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers. In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors. He tries \"to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture, but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality.\" Wilson's goal is to \"rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena\" ([http://www.prrac.org/pdf/WJWMayJune2009PRRAC.pdf PDF]).</ref>\n\n==== Labor movement, trade unions and social democracy ====\nRustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the [[African American]] community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social democratic politics.\n\nHe was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL\u2013CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL\u2013CIO newspaper.\n\nOn the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]].

Discharging this obligation entails risks, of course, but it is up to Solidarity, the ones on the front line, who know better than we the opportunities and dangers before them, to define the aid they need.

He summoned Kirkland to his office for lunch on September 3, 1980, during which he gave a 'negative assessment' of the Polish aid fund that the AFL-CIO had just launched and declared that the federation's open support for Solidarity could be 'deliberately misinterpreted' by the Kremlin in order to justify military intervention. Muskie was not alone in deploring labor's Polish initiative. In a ''New&nbsp;York Times'' column, Flora Lewis called the Workers&nbsp;Aid Fund 'most unfortunate.'

During her early years in the civil rights movement, Feldman worked to integrate [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants in [[Maryland]]. She soon became employment committee chairwoman of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] in [[Harlem]]. She also participated in several [[Freedom Rides]] and was arrested twice.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== Teaching ====\nUpon graduation from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1962, Feldman worked for six months as a substitute third-grade teacher in [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]]. She continued to be active in the civil rights movement, working to desegregate Howard Johnson restaurants in Maryland.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> She participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a [[master's degree]] program in literature at [[New York University]]. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]], which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won [[collective bargaining]] rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> During this time, Feldman became an associate of [[Albert Shanker]], then an organizer for the [[United Federation of Teachers]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== United Federation of Teachers ====\n{{see also|Albert Shanker|American Federation of Teachers}}\nIn 1966, Shanker\u2014now executive director of the UFT\u2014hired Feldman as a full-time field representative on the recommendation of Rustin. Over the next nine years, Feldman became the union's executive director and oversaw its staff. She was elected its secretary (the second-most powerful position in the local) in 1983.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter just two years on the UFT staff, Feldman played a crucial role in the [[American Federation of Teachers#Ocean Hill\u2013Brownsville strike|Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike]]. The city of New York had designated the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts in an effort to give the minority community more say in school affairs.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> The crisis began when the Ocean Hill-Brownsville governing board fired 13 teachers for allegedly sabotaging the decentralization experiment. Shanker demanded that specific charges be filed and the teachers given a chance to defend themselves in [[due process]] proceedings.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nA protracted fight erupted between those in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being \"Jewish-dominated\". Feldman was often at the center of the strike.<ref>Carter, ''Pickets, Parents, and Power,'' 1971.</ref> The UFT emerged from the crisis more powerful than ever and Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> Shanker was elected president of the AFT in 1974, but he retained his post as UFT President. In 1986, Shanker retired as UFT President and Feldman was elected president.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\n==== UFT President after Shanker ====\nFeldman was known for being a quiet yet very effective leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that [[Robert F. Wagner Jr. (deputy mayor)|Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and he was given a free hand.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nShe was instrumental in helping [[David Dinkins]] win election as mayor of New York in 1989 by using union members and resources to build a winning electoral coalition of black and white voters.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> However, once mayor Dinkins stalled on signing a new contract with the teachers' union and Feldman rarely criticized Dinkins publicly for his actions, but she kept the UFT out of Dinkins' 1993 re-election. Dinkins lost in a tight race to [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== American Federation of Teachers ====\nFeldman had been elected an AFT vice president in 1974,<ref>[http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/ward/aft/people.html See the list of AFT vice presidents at]</ref> serving on the national union's executive council and the executive council's executive committee.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won election as the AFT President in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew by more than 160,000 new members (about 17 percent). With Feldman as President, in 2002 AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a \"culture of organizing\" throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging in a series of publicity, legislative, funding and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work; and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nIn May 1997, Feldman was elected to the AFL\u2013CIO executive council and appointed to the executive council's executive committee. During her tenure at the head of the AFT, Feldman also served as a vice president of [[Education International]] and was a board member of the [[International Rescue Committee]] and [[Freedom House]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nFeldman died in 2005 at the age 65.<ref name=\"Feldman\">\n* ''Almanac of Famous People.'' 88th ed.

It is democracy as a way of life. What is \"democracy as a way of life.\" It is a society whose basic institutions are animated by an equality of concern for all human beings, regardless of class, race, sex, religion, and national origin, to develop themselves as persons to their fullest growth, to be free to live up to their desirable potentials as human beings. It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected.\n<!-- The Social Democrat therefore is interested in extending the area of equal opportunity beyond the political sphere to all other areas of social life. He believes that all social institutions to the extent to which they are modifiable must be judged by their, fruits or consequences an the lives of individual persons. It is from this premise of \"democracy as a way of life,\" of equal opportunity for all to develop themselves as persons, taken as a regulative moral ideal, not as an inexorable, \"dialectical\" law of history, that the social democrat derives the justification for multiple programs of social reform-whether it be social security, health and unemployment insurance, a guaranteed minimum family income, occupational safety, or improved and extended public education. -->\n<br />\nWhen it comes to the principled defense of freedom, and to opposition to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a free society has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.\n<br /><br />\nI want to conclude with a few remarks about the domestic scene and the role of Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.\n<br /><br />\nWe are few in number and limited in influence. So was the Fabian Society of Great Britain. But in time it reeducated a great political party and much of the nation. We must try to do the same.</blockquote>\n\n=== Penn Kemble ===\n[[Penn Kemble]] was an American [[political activist]] and a founding member of SDUSA.

The falsity of its more recent elements is readily ascertainable by anyone who cares for the truth\u2014namely, that George Bush was never a neoconservative and that most neoconservatives were never YPSL's. The earlier connections are more obscure but no less false. Although Shachtman was one of the elder statesmen who occasionally made stirring speeches to us, no YPSL of my generation was a Shachtmanite.

The [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) had stopped running independent presidential candidates and consequently the term party in the SPA's name had confused the public. Replacing Socialist with Social Democrats, SDUSA clarified its vision to Americans who confused social democracy with the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] which SDUSA opposes.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html?_r=0|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn response, former SPA Co-Chairman [[Michael Harrington]] resigned from SDUSA in 1973 and founded the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) which criticized SDUSA's [[anti-communism]] and welcomed the [[New Politics (1950s)|New Politics movement]] associated with [[George McGovern]] and the [[New Left]].<ref name=\"Bloodworth147\">{{harvtxt|Bloodworth|2013|p=147}}</ref> SDUSA members opposed McGovern's politics and a few of them helped to start the [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]] and such members have been called [[Henry M. Jackson|Scoop Jackson]] Democrats or [[neoconservatives]], or both. SDUSA's members had been active in the [[civil rights movement]] which had been led since the 1940s by [[A. Philip Randolph]]. SDUSA's leaders had organized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], during which [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivered his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. Under the leadership of Randolph and [[Bayard Rustin]], SDUSA championed Rustin's [[Bayard Rustin#From Protest to Politics|emphasis on economic inequality]] as the most important issue facing African Americans after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. SDUSA's efforts to reduce [[Economic inequality in the United States|economic inequality]] led to a focus on labor unions and economic policy. As a result, SDUSA members were active in the [[AFL\u2013CIO]] confederation as well as in individual unions, especially the [[American Federation of Teachers]].\n\nSDUSA's electoral strategy of [[political realignment]] intended to organize labor unions, civil rights organizations and other constituencies into a coalition that would transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party. The realignment strategy emphasized working with unions and especially the AFL\u2013CIO, putting an emphasis on economic issues that would unite working class voters. SDUSA opposed the New Politics of Senator McGovern which had lost all states other than Massachusetts to [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], when Americans voted for a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1972 United States House of Representatives elections|House elections]]. While SDUSA had endorsed McGovern, it had adopted resolutions criticizing the New Politics for having made criticisms of [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] and [[Working class in the United States|working class]] Americans and for its advocacy of an immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\nSDUSA's organizational activities included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers\u2014it was known mainly because of its members' activities in other organizations. It included civil rights activists and leaders of labor unions such as Bayard Rustin, [[Norman Hill]] and [[Tom Kahn]] of the AFL\u2013CIO as well as [[Sandra Feldman]] and [[Rachelle Horowitz]] of the AFT. Kahn organized the AFL\u2013CIO's support of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], an [[Independent union|independent labor union]] that challenged the [[Polish People's Republic]].<ref name=\"Shevis32\">{{harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=32}}</ref> [[Penn Kemble]] and [[Carl Gershman]] cooperated with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administrations on [[democracy promotion]], beginning with the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]].

In 2008\u20132009, two small organizations emerged, each proclaiming itself to be the successor to SDUSA.\n\nSDUSA's politics were criticized by former SPA Chairman [[Michael Harrington]], who in 1972 announced that he favored an immediate pull-out of American forces from Vietnam (without requiring any guarantees). After losing all votes at the 1972 convention that changed the SPA to SDUSA, Harrington resigned in 1973 and formed his [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) which welcomed the New Politics and middle-class leadership.<ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/><ref name=\"Harrington, Fragments\">\"The new strata of the issue-oriented and college-educated who provided the mass bass for [the McGovern Campaign] were, and are, extremely important to the creation of a new majority for change in this country.\"Harrington, ''Fragments of the Century,'' pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> The name change and the formation of DSOC represented a split with the [[socialist movement in the United States]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored [[Darlington Hoopes]] as [[1956 United States presidential election|candidate for President in 1956]] and who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the SPA no longer sponsored party candidates in elections, continued use of the name \"party\" was \"misleading\" and hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party according to the majority report. The name \"Socialist\" was replaced by \"Social Democrats\" because many American associated the term \"[[Democratic socialism|socialism]]\" with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Moreover, the organization sought to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].<ref name=\"NYT27\">{{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&scp=7&st=p}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1972 Convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one.

On foreign policy, the program called for \"firmness toward Communist aggression\". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed \"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect communist political cadres in [[South Vietnam]] from further military or police reprisals.

The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin's article \"From Protest to Politics\" in which Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. The needs of the black community demanded a shift in political strategy, where blacks would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like) to pursue a common economic agenda. It was time to move from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.<ref name=\"RustinFPTP\"/> A particular danger facing the black community was the chimera of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of [[Black Power]] which Rustin dismissed as a fantasy of middle-class African-Americans that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] while alienating the white allies needed by the black community.<ref name=\"RustinSeparatism\"/>\n\nSDUSA documents had similar criticisms of the agendas advanced by middle class activists increasing their role in the Democratic Party. SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated role of middle-class [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace activists]] in the Democratic Party, particularly associated with the \"New Politics\" of Senator [[George McGovern]], whose [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|presidential candidacy]] was viewed as an ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the United States.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref name=\"Bloodworth147\"/> In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.<ref name=\"NYT74\"/>\n\nIn foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing]] of [[North Vietnam]]. They demanded a negotiated peace treaty to end the [[Vietnam War]], but the majority opposed a unilateral withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, suggesting that such a withdrawal would lead to an annihilation of the free labor unions and of the political opposition.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/><ref>These positions had been advanced by organizations like \"[[Penn Kemble#Negotiations Now!|Negotiations Now!]]\" since the 1960s.</ref><ref name=\"Gershman\">{{cite journal|last=Gershman|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Gershman|title=Totalitarian menace (Controversies: Detente and the left after Afghanistan)|journal=Society|date=3 November 1980|issn=0147-2011|pages=9\u201315|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF02694835}}</ref> After the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam and the victory of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Viet Cong]], SDUSA supported humanitarian assistance to refugees and condemned Senator McGovern for his failure to support such assistance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The View from Washington|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=6|number=2|date=November\u2013December 1978|pages=134\u2013135|jstor=30171704|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/00927678.1978.10553935}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Carl|last=Gershman|url=https://archive.org/details/AfterTheDominoesFell|title=After the dominoes fell|journal=Commentary|date=May 1978|series=SD papers|volume=3|ref=harv|authorlink=Carl Gershman}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational activities ==\n[[File:BayardRustinAug1963-LibraryOfCongress crop.jpg|thumb|upright|National Chairman [[Bayard Rustin]], who headed SDUSA]]\nSDUSA was governed by biannual conventions which invited the participation of interested observers.

Members of SDUSA have served as officers for governmental, private and not-for-profit organizations. [[A.&nbsp;Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Norman Hill]] were leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]. [[Tom Kahn]], [[Sandra Feldman]] and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and [[Penn Kemble]] served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] was a [[public intellectual]]. Writing after the death of [[Tom Kahn]], [[Ben Wattenberg]] commented that SDUSA as an \"umbrella organization\" associated with other [[letterhead organization]]s, saying the following: <blockquote>[SDUSA members seemed to be] ingeniously trying to bury the Soviet Union in a blizzard of letterheads. It seemed that each of Tom's colleagues\u2014Penn Kemble, Carl Gershman, Josh Muravchik and many more\u2014ran a little organization, each with the same interlocking directorate listed on the stationery. Funny thing: The Letterhead Lieutenants did indeed churn up a blizzard, and the Soviet Union is no more.\n\nI never did quite get all the organizational acronyms straight\u2014YPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISL\u2014but the key words were \"democratic\", \"labor\", \"young\" and, until events redefined it away from their understanding, \"socialist\". Ultimately, the umbrella group became \"Social Democrats, U.S.A\", and Tom Kahn was a principal \"theoretician\".\n\nThey talked and wrote endlessly, mostly about communism and democracy, despising the former, adoring the latter. It is easy today to say \"anti-communist\" and \"pro-democracy\" in the same breath. But that is because American foreign policy eventually became just such a mixture, thanks in part to those \"Yipsels\" (Young People's Socialist League), with Tom Kahn as provocateur-at-large.\n\nOn the conservative side, foreign policy used to be anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but nervous about being anti-communist. Tom theorized that to be either, you had to be both.\n\nIt was tough for labor-liberal intellectuals to be \"anti-communist\" in the 1970s. It meant being taunted as \"Cold Warriors\" who saw \"Commies under every bed\" and being labeled as\u2014the unkindest cut\u2014\"right-wingers\".<ref name=\"Wattenberg\">{{cite news|date=April 22, 1992|first=Ben|last=Wattenberg|authorlink=Ben Wattenberg|title=A man whose ideas helped change the world|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 November 2011|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-04-22/news/1992113044_1_tom-kahn-foreign-policy-anti-communist|id=Syndicated: (Thursday April 23, 1993). \"[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110504812 Remembering a man who mattered]\".

Philip Randolph came to national attention as the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]. Randolph proposed a march on Washington, D.C. to protest racial discrimination in the United States armed forces. Meeting with [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[Oval Office]], Randolph respectfully, politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that blacks would march in the capital unless desegregation would occur. The planned march was canceled after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the [[Fair Employment Act]]), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.\n\nIn 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]] to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, in war industries, in government agencies and in labor unions.&nbsp;Following the act, during the [[Philadelphia Transit Strike]] of 1944 the government backed African American workers' striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.\n\nIn 1947, Randolph, along with colleague [[Grant Reynolds (civil rights leader)|Grant Reynolds]], renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]].&nbsp; On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S.

To pursue its economic agenda, the black community needed to shift political strategy, strengthening its political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like).

Philip Randolph Institute, 1970</ref>\n\n===== Influence on William Julius Wilson =====\nRustin's analysis was supported by the later research by [[William Julius Wilson]].<ref name=\"RKRustin\"/> Wilson documented an increase in inequality within the black community, following educated blacks moving into white suburbs and following the decrease of demand for low-skill labor as industry declined in the Northern United States. Such economic problems were not being addressed by a civil rights leadership focused on \"[[affirmative action]]\", a policy benefiting the truly advantaged within the black community. Wilson's criticism of the neglect of working class and poor African Americans by civil rights organizations led to his being mistaken for a conservative, despite his having identified himself as a Rustin-style social democrat. Wilson has served on the advisory board of Social Democrats, USA.<ref>Wilson's ''The Declining Significance of Race'' won the [[American Sociological Association]]'s [[Sydney Spivack Award]]. In ''The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions'' (1978), [[Split labor market theory|Wilson]] argues that the significance of race is waning, and an African-American's class is comparatively more important in determining his or her life chances. His ''The Truly Disadvantaged'', which was selected by the editors of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received ''The Washington Monthly'' Annual Book Award and the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award. In ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy'' (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the \"[[spatial mismatch]]\" theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global [[economic restructuring]], and hence urban [[unemployment]] increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children, since the fathers would not be breadwinners. His ''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'', which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of ''The New York Times Book Review'' and received the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award. His ''The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics'' reaffirms the need for a coalition strategy, as Rustin suggested. In Wilson's most recent book, ''More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City'' (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans. He asks the question, \"Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?\" In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education. Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers. In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors. He tries \"to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture, but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality.\" Wilson's goal is to \"rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena\" ([http://www.prrac.org/pdf/WJWMayJune2009PRRAC.pdf PDF]).</ref>\n\n==== Labor movement, trade unions and social democracy ====\nRustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the [[African American]] community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social democratic politics.\n\nHe was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL\u2013CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL\u2013CIO newspaper.\n\nOn the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]].

Politically, the AFL\u2013CIO supported the [[21 demands of MKS|twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers]] by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL\u2013CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund, which raised almost $300,000 by 1981.<ref name=\"Shevis31\"/> These funds purchased printing presses and office supplies.

It is an obligation from which we could not shrink without doing damage to the ''raison d'etre'' of the American labor movement itself. Discharging this obligation entails risks, of course, but it is up to Solidarity, the ones on the front line, who know better than we the opportunities and dangers before them, to define the aid they need. It was not for us to tell the workers of Poland what was good for them, how they should go about doing what no other workers in history had done. -->Solidarity made its needs known,<ref name=\"Emboldening added\">Emboldening added.</ref> with courage, with clarity, and publicly.

To ensure repayment, the international banking community has in the past pressured the Polish government into policies<ref name=\"Kahn 2008 234\"/> of austerity, which have been borne by the workers by higher prices and longer work weeks.

Its support worried the Carter administration, whose Secretary of State [[Edmund Muskie]] told Kirkland that the AFL\u2013CIO's continued support of Solidarity could trigger a Soviet invasion of Poland.<ref>{{harvtxt|Puddington|2008}} wrote:<blockquote>\"Kirkland's embrace of Solidarity brought him into immediate conflict with the Carter administration. Despite the administration's avowed commitment to human rights, Edmund Muskie, secretary of state, decided that quiet diplomacy was the most prudent course to follow in the Polish crisis. He summoned Kirkland to his office for lunch on September 3, 1980, during which he gave a 'negative assessment' of the Polish aid fund that the AFL-CIO had just launched and declared that the federation's open support for Solidarity could be 'deliberately misinterpreted' by the Kremlin in order to justify military intervention. Muskie was not alone in deploring labor's Polish initiative. In a ''New&nbsp;York Times'' column, Flora Lewis called the Workers&nbsp;Aid Fund 'most unfortunate.'

During her early years in the civil rights movement, Feldman worked to integrate [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants in [[Maryland]]. She soon became employment committee chairwoman of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] in [[Harlem]]. She also participated in several [[Freedom Rides]] and was arrested twice.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== Teaching ====\nUpon graduation from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1962, Feldman worked for six months as a substitute third-grade teacher in [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]]. She continued to be active in the civil rights movement, working to desegregate Howard Johnson restaurants in Maryland.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> She participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a [[master's degree]] program in literature at [[New York University]]. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]], which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won [[collective bargaining]] rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> During this time, Feldman became an associate of [[Albert Shanker]], then an organizer for the [[United Federation of Teachers]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== United Federation of Teachers ====\n{{see also|Albert Shanker|American Federation of Teachers}}\nIn 1966, Shanker\u2014now executive director of the UFT\u2014hired Feldman as a full-time field representative on the recommendation of Rustin. Over the next nine years, Feldman became the union's executive director and oversaw its staff. She was elected its secretary (the second-most powerful position in the local) in 1983.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter just two years on the UFT staff, Feldman played a crucial role in the [[American Federation of Teachers#Ocean Hill\u2013Brownsville strike|Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike]]. The city of New York had designated the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts in an effort to give the minority community more say in school affairs.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> The crisis began when the Ocean Hill-Brownsville governing board fired 13 teachers for allegedly sabotaging the decentralization experiment. Shanker demanded that specific charges be filed and the teachers given a chance to defend themselves in [[due process]] proceedings.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nA protracted fight erupted between those in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being \"Jewish-dominated\". Feldman was often at the center of the strike.<ref>Carter, ''Pickets, Parents, and Power,'' 1971.</ref> The UFT emerged from the crisis more powerful than ever and Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> Shanker was elected president of the AFT in 1974, but he retained his post as UFT President. In 1986, Shanker retired as UFT President and Feldman was elected president.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\n==== UFT President after Shanker ====\nFeldman was known for being a quiet yet very effective leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that [[Robert F. Wagner Jr. (deputy mayor)|Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and he was given a free hand.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/><ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/>\n\nShe was instrumental in helping [[David Dinkins]] win election as mayor of New York in 1989 by using union members and resources to build a winning electoral coalition of black and white voters.<ref name=\"FeldmanNYT\"/> However, once mayor Dinkins stalled on signing a new contract with the teachers' union and Feldman rarely criticized Dinkins publicly for his actions, but she kept the UFT out of Dinkins' 1993 re-election. Dinkins lost in a tight race to [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\n==== American Federation of Teachers ====\nFeldman had been elected an AFT vice president in 1974,<ref>[http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/ward/aft/people.html See the list of AFT vice presidents at]</ref> serving on the national union's executive council and the executive council's executive committee.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nAfter Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won election as the AFT President in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew by more than 160,000 new members (about 17 percent). With Feldman as President, in 2002 AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a \"culture of organizing\" throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging in a series of publicity, legislative, funding and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work; and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nIn May 1997, Feldman was elected to the AFL\u2013CIO executive council and appointed to the executive council's executive committee. During her tenure at the head of the AFT, Feldman also served as a vice president of [[Education International]] and was a board member of the [[International Rescue Committee]] and [[Freedom House]].<ref name=\"Feldman\"/>\n\nFeldman died in 2005 at the age 65.<ref name=\"Feldman\">\n* ''Almanac of Famous People.'' 88th ed.

It is democracy as a way of life. What is \"democracy as a way of life.\" It is a society whose basic institutions are animated by an equality of concern for all human beings, regardless of class, race, sex, religion, and national origin, to develop themselves as persons to their fullest growth, to be free to live up to their desirable potentials as human beings. It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected.\n<!-- The Social Democrat therefore is interested in extending the area of equal opportunity beyond the political sphere to all other areas of social life. He believes that all social institutions to the extent to which they are modifiable must be judged by their, fruits or consequences an the lives of individual persons. It is from this premise of \"democracy as a way of life,\" of equal opportunity for all to develop themselves as persons, taken as a regulative moral ideal, not as an inexorable, \"dialectical\" law of history, that the social democrat derives the justification for multiple programs of social reform-whether it be social security, health and unemployment insurance, a guaranteed minimum family income, occupational safety, or improved and extended public education. -->\n<br />\nWhen it comes to the principled defense of freedom, and to opposition to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a free society has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.\n<br /><br />\nI want to conclude with a few remarks about the domestic scene and the role of Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.\n<br /><br />\nWe are few in number and limited in influence. So was the Fabian Society of Great Britain. But in time it reeducated a great political party and much of the nation. We must try to do the same.</blockquote>\n\n=== Penn Kemble ===\n[[Penn Kemble]] was an American [[political activist]] and a founding member of SDUSA.

{"title_page": "Private military company", "text_new": "{{short description|company providing armed combat or security services}}\n{{globalize|date=April 2018}}\n{{Use American English|date=September 2019}}\nA '''private military company''' ('''PMC''') is a [[private company]] providing armed combat or security services for financial gain. PMCs refer to their staff as \"security contractors\" or \"private military contractors\". Private military companies refer to their business generally as the \"private military industry\" or \"The Circuit\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.circuit-magazine.com/ |title=The Circuit Magazine \u2013 For Security & Protection Specialists |author= |date= |website=Circuit Magazine |accessdate=6 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506015510/https://circuit-magazine.com/ |archivedate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe services and expertise offered by PMCs are typically similar to those of governmental security, military or police forces, most often on a smaller scale. While PMCs often provide services to train or supplement official [[armed forces]] in service of governments, they can also be employed by private companies to provide [[bodyguard]]s for key staff or protection of company premises, especially in hostile territories. However, contractors who use offensive force in a [[war]] zone could be considered [[unlawful combatant]]s, in reference to a concept outlined in the [[Geneva Conventions]] and explicitly specified by the 2006 American [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-blackwater15oct15,1,6804674,full.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage&ctrack=2&cset=true |title=America's own unlawful combatants? |first=Julian E. |last=Barnes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2007-10-15}}</ref> There has been controversy over whether PMCs in active combat zones should be considered [[mercenaries]].\n\nThe services of private contractors are used around the world. [[P. W. Singer]], author of ''Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry'', says \"In geographic terms, it operates in over 50 different countries. It\u2019s operated in every single continent but Antarctica.\"  Singer states that in the 1990s there used to be 50 military personnel for every 1 contractor, and now the ratio is 10 to 1. He also points out that these contractors have a number of duties depending on whom they are hired by. In developing countries that have natural resources, such as oil refineries in Iraq, they are hired to guard the area.

However, it was three years later before it was first used. In support of a [[United States Army Central|United States Third Army]] mission, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) used LOGCAP to contract for the construction and maintenance of two petroleum pipelines systems in [[Southwest Asia]].\n\nLater, USACE awarded the first contract under LOGCAP to Brown and Root Services (now [[KBR (company)|KBR]]) in August 1992 as a cost-plus-award-fee contract, which was used in December that year to support the [[United Nations]] forces in [[Somalia]].\n\nSome contractors have served in advisory roles, that help train local militaries to fight more effectively, instead of intervening directly. Much of the [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeper]] training Western governments have provided to African militaries was done by private firms,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and with the increasing absence of Western military support to international peace operations, the private sector was commonly utilized to provide services to [[peace and stability operations]] from [[Haiti]] to [[Darfur]].\n\nThe [[Center for Public Integrity]] reported that since 1994, the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] entered into 3,601 contracts worth $300 billion with 12 U.S. based  various PMCs within the [[United States]], specifically during the initial response after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[New Orleans]].\n\nDomestic operations are generally under the auspice of state or federal agencies such as the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] or the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] rather than the Department of Defense. Driven by increasingly greater fears of domestic [[terror attacks]] and civil unrest and disruption in the wake of disasters, more conventional security companies are moving into operations arenas that would fall within the definition of a PMC. The [[United States State Department]] also employs several companies to provide support in danger zones that would be difficult for conventional U.S. forces.\n\n===PMCs in Iraq===\nIn December 2006, there were estimated to be at least 100,000 contractors working directly for the [[United States Department of Defense]] in [[Iraq]] which was a tenfold increase in the use of private contractors for military operations since the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], just over a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120401311.html |title=Census Counts 100,000 Contractors in Iraq |newspaper=Washington Post |last=Merle |first=Renae |date=2006-12-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206025051/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120401311.html |archivedate=2006-12-06 }}</ref> The prevalence of PMCs led to the foundation of [[trade group]] the [[Private Security Company Association of Iraq]].

While having less publicity and scrutiny compared to PMC involvement in Iraq, in the Western media, the role of the PMCs in this area should not be underestimated. Up till today PMCs are active in this region to both provide support for the UN [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]] mission, and provide security for private shipping organizations that sail through the [[Gulf of Aden]]. At the seas the PMCs are hired to deter pirates from attacking vessels and taking the shipping crew and their transport hostage. While, a large variety of international naval missions with the same goals  (such as EU's [[Operation Atalanta|Atalanta]], NATO's [[Operation Ocean Shield|Ocean Shield]], and one by [[Combined Task Force 150|CTF 150]]) are and were active in this region, it still is necessary for the shipping companies to have security personnel on-deck. This is a service that could almost solely be provided by PMCs. While these PMCs seem to be successful in providing this de-centralized form of security, it also has the large down sight. Since, inherently to its de-centralized nature, it is very hard for the UN or other international organizations to provide effective oversight over what happens at the seas. Whereas, the UN showed that between 2010 and 2015 there were over 50 encounters between the national sovereign Navies, that participated to the missions, resulting in over 1200 detained pirates, only one PMC published information over this period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jarle Hansen|first=Stig|date=July 2012|title=International Interventions, State-Building and Democratization: Justifying the Role of the Private Security Companies in Somalia?|journal=African Security|language=en|volume=5|issue=3\u20134|pages=255\u2013266|doi=10.1080/19392206.2012.732897|issn=1939-2206}}</ref> Since the PMCs are so much more active in this area, and covering a larger part of it through it activities on board of trading ships, this seems to be a very low estimate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Affi|first=Ladan|last2=Elmi|first2=Afyare A.|last3=Knight|first3=W.

No international court has jurisdiction over these corporations and there is no preexisting mechanism in place bound by international law to account and manage for PMSCs use of force. However, there are a few soft law instruments in which these corporations are held responsible to some degree of legal status. One favorable argument for PMSCs is that they have the skills and expertise necessary to deploy in a short times notice with the ability to provide for a wide range of services (Malamud, 2014). However, outsourcing does bring on the risk of a lack of transparency in the selection process of third party personnel. In addition, the UN is held responsible to ensure a clean human rights record and maintaining a gold standard for missions that entail the use of private contractors. Often, states do not have control over these operations. In many cases, there are doubts to as if the work of private contractors does or does not fall within the boundaries of Article 47 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as relating to the Protections of International Armed Conflicts 1977 amongst others (Karska & Karski, 2014). Although, in 2012 the UN Department of Safety and security published a new policy in which oversees the use of armed private contractors. Planning is also underway at the United Nations to prepare a convention dealing with PMSCs. Establishing clear criteria is necessary to determine when it is permissible to use such companies and for what activities. Criteria such as transparent decision making procedures, solid vetting and screening measures, as well as standard operating procedures.\n\n==PMC activities elsewhere==\n* In 1994 and 1995 South African based PMC [[Executive Outcomes]] was involved in two military actions in Africa.

The development of this Standard was facilitated by the U.S. Department of Defense through a consensus-based process. The DOD was required by Congress through Section 833 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011 to begin using business and operational standards in contracting and management of PSCs, with the intent of raising the overall standard of performance of these companies.

PMCs refer to their staff as \"security contractors\" or \"private military contractors\". Private military companies refer to their business generally as the \"private military industry\" or \"The Circuit\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.circuit-magazine.com/ |title=The Circuit Magazine \u2013 For Security & Protection Specialists |author= |date= |website=Circuit Magazine |accessdate=6 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506015510/https://circuit-magazine.com/ |archivedate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe services and expertise offered by PMCs are typically similar to those of governmental security, military or police forces, most often on a smaller scale. While PMCs often provide services to train or supplement official [[armed forces]] in service of governments, they can also be employed by private companies to provide [[bodyguard]]s for key staff or protection of company premises, especially in hostile territories. However, contractors who use offensive force in a [[war]] zone could be considered [[unlawful combatant]]s, in reference to a concept outlined in the [[Geneva Conventions]] and explicitly specified by the 2006 American [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-blackwater15oct15,1,6804674,full.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage&ctrack=2&cset=true |title=America's own unlawful combatants? |first=Julian E. |last=Barnes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2007-10-15}}</ref> There has been controversy over whether PMCs in active combat zones should be considered [[mercenaries]].\n\nThe services of private contractors are used around the world. [[P. W. Singer]], author of ''Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry'', says \"In geographic terms, it operates in over 50 different countries. It\u2019s operated in every single continent but Antarctica.\"  Singer states that in the 1990s there used to be 50 military personnel for every 1 contractor, and now the ratio is 10 to 1. He also points out that these contractors have a number of duties depending on whom they are hired by. In developing countries that have natural resources, such as oil refineries in Iraq, they are hired to guard the area. They are also hired to guard companies that contract services and reconstruction efforts such as General Electric. Apart from securing companies, they secure officials and government affiliates. Private military companies carry out many different missions and jobs. Some examples include [[close protection]] for the Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] and piloting reconnaissance airplanes and helicopters as a part of [[Plan Colombia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38576 |title=COLOMBIA-ECUADOR: Coca Spraying Makes for Toxic Relations |first=Constanza |last=Vieira |publisher=IPS |date=2007-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118035255/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38576 |archivedate=2008-01-18}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1253 Private Security Transnational Enterprises in Colombia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417203427/http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1253 |date=2008-04-17 }}'' [[Jos\u00e9 Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective]] February, 2008.</ref> According to a study from 2003 the PMC industry was worth over $100 billion a year at that time.<ref name=\"Soldiers of Good Fortune\">{{cite magazine |last=Yeoman |first=Barry |title=Soldiers of Good Fortune |magazine=Mother Jones |date=2003-06-01 |url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/05/ma_365_01.html |accessdate=2007-05-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520151719/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/05/ma_365_01.html |archivedate=2007-05-20 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2008 study by the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], private contractors make up 29% of the workforce in the [[United States Intelligence Community]] and cost the equivalent of 49% of their personnel budgets.<ref name=TopSecretAmerica>{{cite book |last=Priest |first=Dana |title=Top Secret America: The Rise of the New American Security State |year=2011 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |isbn=978-0-316-18221-8 |page=320}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Special Air Service (sas) in North Africa during the Second World War E21340.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[David Stirling]], an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] veteran, founded a PMC in the 1960s.]]\nModern PMCs trace their origins back to a group of ex-[[Special Air Service|SAS]] British veterans in 1965 who, under the leadership of the founder of the SAS, Sir [[David Stirling]] and [[John Woodhouse (British Army officer)|John Woodhouse]], founded WatchGuard International (formerly with offices in [[Sloane Street]] before moving to South Audley Street in [[Mayfair]]) as a private company that could be contracted out for security and military purposes.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=a4h_c4TqZM4C |title=Physical and Logical Security Convergence: Powered By Enterprise Security Management: Powered By Enterprise Security Management |author1=Crowell, William P |author2=Contos, Brian T |author3=DeRodeff, Colby |author4=Dunkel, Dan |year=2011 |publisher=Syngress |accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9780080558783 }}</ref>\n\nThe company's first assignment was to go to [[Yemen]] to report on the state of the royalist forces when a cease-fire was declared. At the same time Stirling was cultivating his contacts in the [[Iran]]ian government and exploring the chances of obtaining work in [[Africa]]. The company eventually operated in [[Zambia]] and in [[Sierra Leone]], providing training teams and advising on security matters. Stirling also organised deals to sell British weapons and military personnel to other countries for various privatised foreign policy operations. Contracts were mainly with the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] and involved weapons supply and training. The company was also linked with a failed attempt to overthrow Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] from power in [[Libya]] in 1971.

In support of a [[United States Army Central|United States Third Army]] mission, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) used LOGCAP to contract for the construction and maintenance of two petroleum pipelines systems in [[Southwest Asia]].\n\nLater, USACE awarded the first contract under LOGCAP to Brown and Root Services (now [[KBR (company)|KBR]]) in August 1992 as a cost-plus-award-fee contract, which was used in December that year to support the [[United Nations]] forces in [[Somalia]].\n\nSome contractors have served in advisory roles, that help train local militaries to fight more effectively, instead of intervening directly. Much of the [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeper]] training Western governments have provided to African militaries was done by private firms,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and with the increasing absence of Western military support to international peace operations, the private sector was commonly utilized to provide services to [[peace and stability operations]] from [[Haiti]] to [[Darfur]].\n\nThe [[Center for Public Integrity]] reported that since 1994, the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] entered into 3,601 contracts worth $300 billion with 12 U.S. based  various PMCs within the [[United States]], specifically during the initial response after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[New Orleans]].\n\nDomestic operations are generally under the auspice of state or federal agencies such as the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] or the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] rather than the Department of Defense. Driven by increasingly greater fears of domestic [[terror attacks]] and civil unrest and disruption in the wake of disasters, more conventional security companies are moving into operations arenas that would fall within the definition of a PMC. The [[United States State Department]] also employs several companies to provide support in danger zones that would be difficult for conventional U.S. forces.\n\n===PMCs in Iraq===\nIn December 2006, there were estimated to be at least 100,000 contractors working directly for the [[United States Department of Defense]] in [[Iraq]] which was a tenfold increase in the use of private contractors for military operations since the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], just over a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120401311.html |title=Census Counts 100,000 Contractors in Iraq |newspaper=Washington Post |last=Merle |first=Renae |date=2006-12-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206025051/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120401311.html |archivedate=2006-12-06 }}</ref> The prevalence of PMCs led to the foundation of [[trade group]] the [[Private Security Company Association of Iraq]].

While having less publicity and scrutiny compared to PMC involvement in Iraq, in the Western media, the role of the PMCs in this area should not be underestimated. Up till today PMCs are active in this region to both provide support for the UN [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]] mission, and provide security for private shipping organizations that sail through the [[Gulf of Aden]]. At the seas the PMCs are hired to deter pirates from attacking vessels and taking the shipping crew and their transport hostage. While, a large variety of international naval missions with the same goals  (such as EU's [[Operation Atalanta|Atalanta]], NATO's [[Operation Ocean Shield|Ocean Shield]], and one by [[Combined Task Force 150|CTF 150]]) are and were active in this region, it still is necessary for the shipping companies to have security personnel on-deck. This is a service that could almost solely be provided by PMCs. While these PMCs seem to be successful in providing this de-centralized form of security, it also has the large down sight. Since, inherently to its de-centralized nature, it is very hard for the UN or other international organizations to provide effective oversight over what happens at the seas. Whereas, the UN showed that between 2010 and 2015 there were over 50 encounters between the national sovereign Navies, that participated to the missions, resulting in over 1200 detained pirates, only one PMC published information over this period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jarle Hansen|first=Stig|date=July 2012|title=International Interventions, State-Building and Democratization: Justifying the Role of the Private Security Companies in Somalia?|journal=African Security|language=en|volume=5|issue=3\u20134|pages=255\u2013266|doi=10.1080/19392206.2012.732897|issn=1939-2206}}</ref> Since the PMCs are so much more active in this area, and covering a larger part of it through it activities on board of trading ships, this seems to be a very low estimate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Affi|first=Ladan|last2=Elmi|first2=Afyare A.|last3=Knight|first3=W.

No international court has jurisdiction over these corporations and there is no preexisting mechanism in place bound by international law to account and manage for PMSCs use of force. However, there are a few soft law instruments in which these corporations are held responsible to some degree of legal status. One favorable argument for PMSCs is that they have the skills and expertise necessary to deploy in a short times notice with the ability to provide for a wide range of services (Malamud, 2014). However, outsourcing does bring on the risk of a lack of transparency in the selection process of third party personnel. In addition, the UN is held responsible to ensure a clean human rights record and maintaining a gold standard for missions that entail the use of private contractors. Often, states do not have control over these operations. In many cases, there are doubts to as if the work of private contractors does or does not fall within the boundaries of Article 47 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as relating to the Protections of International Armed Conflicts 1977 amongst others (Karska & Karski, 2014). Although, in 2012 the UN Department of Safety and security published a new policy in which oversees the use of armed private contractors. Planning is also underway at the United Nations to prepare a convention dealing with PMSCs. Establishing clear criteria is necessary to determine when it is permissible to use such companies and for what activities. Criteria such as transparent decision making procedures, solid vetting and screening measures, as well as standard operating procedures.\n\n==PMC activities elsewhere==\n* In 1994 and 1995 South African based PMC [[Executive Outcomes]] was involved in two military actions in Africa.

The development of this Standard was facilitated by the U.S. Department of Defense through a consensus-based process. The DOD was required by Congress through Section 833 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011 to begin using business and operational standards in contracting and management of PSCs, with the intent of raising the overall standard of performance of these companies. This Standard fulfills that mandate. It has also been recognized by the American National Standards Institute and are achieving international recognition.\n\nPSC.2 \u2013 CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT AND AUDITING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR QUALITY OF PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY OPERATION<ref name=\"psm.du.edu\"/>\nThis Standard provides requirements and guidance for conducting conformity assessment of the Management System for Quality of Private Security Company Operations (PSC) Standard. It provides requirements for bodies providing auditing and third party certification of Private Security Company Operations \u2013 private security providers working for any client. It provides requirements and guidance on the management of audit programs, conduct of internal or external audits of the management system and PSC operations, as well as on competence and evaluation of auditors.\n\nPSC.3 \u2013 MATURITY MODEL FOR THE PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICE PROVIDERS<ref name=\"psm.du.edu\"/>\nStandard PSC.3 development is complete and has been approved in January 2013. PSC.3 will benefit private security service providers in improving their quality of services consistent with respect for human rights and legal and contractual obligations. It will provide a basis for managing risk while reducing costs, demonstrating legal compliance, enhancing stakeholder relations, and meeting client expectations. The model standard outlines six phases ranging from no process in place for quality assurance management, to going beyond the requirements of the standard. Criteria based on core elements of  ANSI/ASIS PSC.1-2012  Standard can be used to demonstrate continual improvement and are compatible with rewards and recognition programs.\n\nPSC.4 \u2013 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND SECURITY MANAGEMENT FOR PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY'S OPERATING IN THE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT<ref name=\"psm.du.edu\"/>\nThis Standard provides guidance for PMSCs to implement the ANSI/ASIS PSC.1-2012 for private maritime security companies.

Martana is on the left and Bisentino on the right. The straight shore to the far left is Marta. To the left of Martana is the headland of Capodimonte.]]\n'''Lake Bolsena''' ({{lang-it|'''Lago di Bolsena'''}}) of central [[Italy]], is a lake of [[volcano|volcanic]] and tectonic origin. Roman historic records indicate activity of the Vulsini volcano occurred as recently as 104 BC; it has been dormant since then. The two islands in the southern part of the lake were formed by underwater eruptions following the collapse that created the depression.\n\nThe lake is supplied entirely from the aquifer, rainfall and runoff, with one outlet at the southern end. A sewage treatment plant filters most of the raw sewage from the surrounding communities. Constructed in 1996, it features pipelines transporting the sewage from every major community around the lake to the treatment plant on the Marta River; that is, no effluents enter the lake.<ref name=M2>Mosello (2004) p. 2.</ref> Fertilizers are a second source of contamination. However, the chemical content of the lake is monitored at several stations around it.\n\nLying within the northern part of the  [[province of Viterbo]] that is called ''Alto Lazio'' (\"Upper Latium\") or ''[[Tuscia]]'', the lake has a long historic tradition. The Romans called it ''Lacus Volsinii'', adapting the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] name, [[Velzna]], of the last Etruscan city to hold out against Rome, which was translocated after 264 BC, and its original location today has not been securely identified. The lake is bordered on one side by a modernized version of the Roman consular road ''[[Via Cassia]]''. In addition to the historic sites of all periods, Lake Bolsena is currently surrounded by numerous tourist establishments, largely for camping, agrotourism and bed and breakfasts.\n\nOne third of the lake was donated to the [[Catholic church]] by the noble family Alberici of Orvieto. In recognition of the donation the Alberici family was honored with a ceremony three times a year performed by the [[Bishop of Orvieto]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe lake has an oval shape typical of [[Volcanic crater|crater]] lakes. The long axis of the [[ellipse]] is aligned in a north-south direction. The bottom is roughly conical reaching a maximum depth at a point in the middle. The entire lake is surrounded by hills on the flanks and summits of which are the comuni. The watershed was home to 22,000 permanent residents in 2004, and 35,000 in the summer season.<ref name=M2/>\n\nElevations on the north of the lake are the highest, with a maximum of {{convert|702|m|ft|abbr=on}}. As the lake is at {{convert|305|m|ft|abbr=on}}, no hill is more than {{convert|397|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than it. On the northern rim of the caldera is [[San Lorenzo Nuovo]] (\"New Saint Lawrence\"), which was moved from an older site (a hypothetical San Lorenzo Vecchio, \"Old Saint Lawrence\") further down the slope to avoid [[malaria]]. The northern shore of the lake once featured marshes, breeding grounds for the mosquitos that carry the disease. Currently it is agricultural. At the site of old San Lorenzo are [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities. To the north of San Lorenzo Nuovo and the caldera rim is [[Acquapendente]].\n\nThe hills to the east are {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|650|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Bolsena]] extends upward on the northeast shore, with [[Orvieto]] {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} further to the northeast, at the edge of the volcanic region. On the southeast of the lake is [[Montefiascone]] at an elevation of {{convert|633|m|ft|abbr=on}}, up on the ridge of Montefiascone caldera. To the south of the lake is [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]], on the right bank of the Marta River, sole effluent of the lake. The shore there is straight and developed. Elevations are within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the lake. Next to Marta are [[Valentano]] and [[Capodimonte, Lazio|Capodimonte]], the latter being built on and around nearly the only headland on the lake, which forms a protective harbor. About {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south are [[Tuscania]] and [[Viterbo]], the latter being the regional capital.\n\nFrom [[Valentano]] north is the Latera caldera, a shallow crater perhaps half the size of Lake Bolsena, with [[Lake Mezzano]] (usually too small for the map) at the western end. On its north rim is [[Latera]]. The floor of the caldera is mainly agricultural although the uncultivable rocky lava flows have been left forested. Although the hills on the west side of Lake Bolsena are only slightly higher than those on the south, the terrain is somewhat too rough for settlement. Fields extend as far as they can into v-shaped valleys and there is no flat shore.\n\nThe hills to the north loom over the lake. At their western edge are [[Grotte di Castro]] and [[Gradoli]].<ref>Washington (1906) pp. 3-4.</ref>\n[[File:Bolsenasee nordhaelfte panorama.jpg|none|thumb|600px|The western and northern shores viewed from the eastern shore.

The city on the left of the far shore is [[Bolsena]]]]\n[[File:Bolsenasee suedhaelfte panorama.jpg|none|thumb|600px|Northward view of the lake from the vicinity of [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]]. Bolsena is visible in the far distance, as well as the two islands on the left.]]\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Vulsini}}\nLake Bolsena is at the center of the Vulsinii (or Vulsino) Volcanic District of the Roman Comagmatic Region. The lake formed when a circular area collapsed after the depletion of the underlying magmatic chamber that fed the whole volcanic district. Although it is generally known as a volcanic lake, like its southern neighbor [[Lake Bracciano]] it is not a crater lake nor it occupies a caldera. The major calderas of the area are found close to the lake's rim (Latera to the west and Montefiascone to the south east).\n\n==Islands of the lake==\n\n===Bisentina===\n[[File:Isola Bisentina, Lago di Bolsena.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Isola Bisentina]]\nWith an area of {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, Bisentina is the largest island, and is accessible via a ferry service from [[Capodimonte, Lazio|Capodimonte]]. On the island are groves of [[evergreen oak]]s, Italian gardens, and various monuments: the [[church (building)|church]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] and [[Saint Christopher]] with its [[cupola]] built by the [[architect]] [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]; the Franciscan [[convent]]; the ''Rocchina'', a small temple dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]]. The latter was constructed in an octagonal floorplan by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Antonio da Sangallo]], over an Etruscan [[columbarium]] previously erected on a rocky outcrop on the lake. Another monument, the [[chapel]] of the [[Crucifix]], contains [[fresco]]s of the fifth century. The ''Malta dei Papi'', a former [[prison]] for [[ecclesiastic]]s found guilty of [[heresy]], was shaped from a small cave with a trapdoor placed at a height of {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[Etruscans]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] left few traces of their stay on the island.  In the 9th century it provided refuge from the incursions of the [[Saracen]]s.\n\nAbout 1250, it became the property of the lord of Bisenzio, who abandoned it and burned it following disagreements with the inhabitants of the island. In 1261, [[Urban IV]] reconquered it. The island was destroyed again in 1333 by [[Louis IV of Bavaria]], accused of heresy and excommunicated by the pope. The property of the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] family from 1400 onwards, it had a period of prosperity and was visited by many popes. In 1635, it was governed by [[Odoardo Farnese]], duke of [[Castro (city)|Castro]], who entered into conflict with the Church, resulting in the total destruction of Castro. The two islands returned to the Church's control but were soon ceded again.  The princess Beatrice Spada Potenziani, wife of the duke Fieschi Ravaschieri, owned it until 2017. Where it was sold to a foundation.\n\n===Martana===\n[[File:Isla Martana Lago Bolsena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Isola Martana]]\nLocated opposite the town of [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]], the island of Martana is reputed to have once guarded the [[relic]]s of [[Christina of Bolsena|Saint Christine]] to keep them from falling into the hands of the [[barbarian]]s.  Later, it is said that, during the dominion of the [[Goths]], their queen [[Amalasuntha]] was assassinated there.\n\nThe island is currently private property and no visitors are allowed.\n\n==Marta outlet==\nThe Marta is an [[Emissary (hydraulics)|emissary]] of Lake Bolsena to the east of the community of  [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]], emptying into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

Martana is on the left and Bisentino on the right. The straight shore to the far left is Marta. To the left of Martana is the headland of Capodimonte.]]\n'''Lake Bolsena''' ({{lang-it|'''Lago di Bolsena'''}}) of central [[Italy]], is a lake of [[volcano|volcanic]] and tectonic origin. Roman historic records indicate activity of the Vulsini volcano occurred as recently as 104 BC; it has been dormant since then. The two islands in the southern part of the lake were formed by underwater eruptions following the collapse that created the depression.\n\nThe lake is supplied entirely from the aquifer, rainfall and runoff, with one outlet at the southern end. A sewage treatment plant filters most of the raw sewage from the surrounding communities. Constructed in 1996, it features pipelines transporting the sewage from every major community around the lake to the treatment plant on the Marta River; that is, no effluents enter the lake.<ref name=M2>Mosello (2004) p. 2.</ref> Fertilizers are a second source of contamination. However, the chemical content of the lake is monitored at several stations around it.\n\nLying within the northern part of the  [[province of Viterbo]] that is called ''Alto Lazio'' (\"Upper Latium\") or ''[[Tuscia]]'', the lake has a long historic tradition. The Romans called it ''Lacus Volsinii'', adapting the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] name, [[Velzna]], of the last Etruscan city to hold out against Rome, which was translocated after 264 BC, and its original location today has not been securely identified. The lake is bordered on one side by a modernized version of the Roman consular road ''[[Via Cassia]]''. In addition to the historic sites of all periods, Lake Bolsena is currently surrounded by numerous tourist establishments, largely for camping, agrotourism and bed and breakfasts.\n\nOne third of the lake was donated to the [[Catholic church]] by the noble family Alberici of Orvieto. In recognition of the donation the Alberici family was honored with a ceremony three times a year performed by the [[Bishop of Orvieto]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe lake has an oval shape typical of [[Volcanic crater|crater]] lakes. The long axis of the [[ellipse]] is aligned in a north-south direction. The bottom is roughly conical reaching a maximum depth at a point in the middle. The entire lake is surrounded by hills on the flanks and summits of which are the comuni. The watershed was home to 22,000 permanent residents in 2004, and 35,000 in the summer season.<ref name=M2/>\n\nElevations on the north of the lake are the highest, with a maximum of {{convert|702|m|ft|abbr=on}}. As the lake is at {{convert|305|m|ft|abbr=on}}, no hill is more than {{convert|397|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than it. On the northern rim of the caldera is [[San Lorenzo Nuovo]] (\"New Saint Lawrence\"), which was moved from an older site (a hypothetical San Lorenzo Vecchio, \"Old Saint Lawrence\") further down the slope to avoid [[malaria]]. The northern shore of the lake once featured marshes, breeding grounds for the mosquitos that carry the disease. Currently it is agricultural. At the site of old San Lorenzo are [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities. To the north of San Lorenzo Nuovo and the caldera rim is [[Acquapendente]].\n\nThe hills to the east are {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|650|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Bolsena]] extends upward on the northeast shore, with [[Orvieto]] {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} further to the northeast, at the edge of the volcanic region. On the southeast of the lake is [[Montefiascone]] at an elevation of {{convert|633|m|ft|abbr=on}}, up on the ridge of Montefiascone caldera. To the south of the lake is [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]], on the right bank of the Marta River, sole effluent of the lake. The shore there is straight and developed. Elevations are within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the lake. Next to Marta are [[Valentano]] and [[Capodimonte, Lazio|Capodimonte]], the latter being built on and around nearly the only headland on the lake, which forms a protective harbor. About {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south are [[Tuscania]] and [[Viterbo]], the latter being the regional capital.\n\nFrom [[Valentano]] north is the Latera caldera, a shallow crater perhaps half the size of Lake Bolsena, with [[Lake Mezzano]] (usually too small for the map) at the western end. On its north rim is [[Latera]]. The floor of the caldera is mainly agricultural although the uncultivable rocky lava flows have been left forested. Although the hills on the west side of Lake Bolsena are only slightly higher than those on the south, the terrain is somewhat too rough for settlement. Fields extend as far as they can into v-shaped valleys and there is no flat shore.\n\nThe hills to the north loom over the lake. At their western edge are [[Grotte di Castro]] and [[Gradoli]].<ref>Washington (1906) pp. 3-4.</ref>\n[[File:Bolsenasee nordhaelfte panorama.jpg|none|thumb|600px|The western and northern shores viewed from the eastern shore.

Bolsena is visible in the far distance, as well as the two islands on the left.]]\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Vulsini}}\nLake Bolsena is at the center of the Vulsinii (or Vulsino) Volcanic District of the Roman Comagmatic Region. The lake formed when a circular area collapsed after the depletion of the underlying magmatic chamber that fed the whole volcanic district. Although it is generally known as a volcanic lake, like its southern neighbor [[Lake Bracciano]] it is not a crater lake nor it occupies a caldera. The major calderas of the area are found close to the lake's rim (Latera to the west and Montefiascone to the south east).\n\n==Islands of the lake==\n\n===Bisentina===\n[[File:Isola Bisentina, Lago di Bolsena.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Isola Bisentina]]\nWith an area of {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, Bisentina is the largest island, and is accessible via a ferry service from [[Capodimonte, Lazio|Capodimonte]]. On the island are groves of [[evergreen oak]]s, Italian gardens, and various monuments: the [[church (building)|church]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] and [[Saint Christopher]] with its [[cupola]] built by the [[architect]] [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]; the Franciscan [[convent]]; the ''Rocchina'', a small temple dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]]. The latter was constructed in an octagonal floorplan by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Antonio da Sangallo]], over an Etruscan [[columbarium]] previously erected on a rocky outcrop on the lake. Another monument, the [[chapel]] of the [[Crucifix]], contains [[fresco]]s of the fifth century. The ''Malta dei Papi'', a former [[prison]] for [[ecclesiastic]]s found guilty of [[heresy]], was shaped from a small cave with a trapdoor placed at a height of {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[Etruscans]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] left few traces of their stay on the island.  In the 9th century it provided refuge from the incursions of the [[Saracen]]s.\n\nAbout 1250, it became the property of the lord of Bisenzio, who abandoned it and burned it following disagreements with the inhabitants of the island. In 1261, [[Urban IV]] reconquered it. The island was destroyed again in 1333 by [[Louis IV of Bavaria]], accused of heresy and excommunicated by the pope. The property of the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] family from 1400 onwards, it had a period of prosperity and was visited by many popes. In 1635, it was governed by [[Odoardo Farnese]], duke of [[Castro (city)|Castro]], who entered into conflict with the Church, resulting in the total destruction of Castro. The two islands returned to the Church's control but were soon ceded again.  The princess Beatrice Spada Potenziani, wife of the duke Fieschi Ravaschieri, owned it until 2017. Where it was sold to a foundation.\n\n===Martana===\n[[File:Isla Martana Lago Bolsena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Isola Martana]]\nLocated opposite the town of [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]], the island of Martana is reputed to have once guarded the [[relic]]s of [[Saint Christine]] to keep them from falling into the hands of the [[barbarian]]s.  Later, it is said that, during the dominion of the [[Goths]], their queen [[Amalasuntha]] was assassinated there.\n\nThe island is currently private property and no visitors are allowed.\n\n==Marta outlet==\nThe Marta is an [[Emissary (hydraulics)|emissary]] of Lake Bolsena to the east of the community of  [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]], emptying into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. After passing through Marta, [[Tuscania]] and [[Tarquinia]], it reaches the sea near [[Lido di Tarquinia]]. Salt pans have been constructed between its mouth and that of the [[Mignone]] river.\n\n==''Comuni'' bordering the lake==\nThe following ''[[comune|comuni]]'' are situated on the shore of Lake Bolsena:\n\n* [[Bolsena]]\n* [[Montefiascone]]\n* [[Marta, Lazio|Marta]]\n* [[Capodimonte, Lazio|Capodimonte]]\n* [[Valentano]]\n* [[Gradoli]]\n* [[Grotte di Castro]]\n* [[San Lorenzo Nuovo]]\n\nEach has a designated length of beach for summer swimming.

He decried the overall level of military spending as opposed to the funding of education and of what he regarded as the consequent, poor educational outcomes achieved.\n\nSenator Gravel called on congressional Democrats to force a 'constitutional crisis' by denying all further budgetary appropriations in aid of continued American military involvement in Iraq. He further argued that the [[income tax]] should be 'wiped out' in favor of the [[FairTax]] proposal - which imposes a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] [[sales tax]] on newly manufactured items varying from 19% to 23% while providing 'prebates' to 'untax' families spending on necessities, up to the poverty level.

And he voiced his support for the constitutional and legal reform necessary to effect the [[National Initiative]] as a means of enabling citizen-initiated national lawmaking.\n\nSenator Gravel also spoke in favor of public financial assistance for campaigning presidential candidates.\n\nOn February 26, 2007, Senator Gravel was interviewed about his campaign on the American [[C-SPAN]] network's ''[[Washington Journal]]'' program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gravel2008.com/?q=node/440|title=\u304a\u85a6\u3081\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u7dcf\u5408\u60c5\u5831\u6bd4\u8f03WEB\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|author=|date=|website=www.gravel2008.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn a February 25, 2007 [[Washington Post]]/[[ABC News]] nationwide poll of voters who lean Democratic, 0% supported Gravel for the Democratic presidential nomination.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_022607.htm | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=2010-05-12 | title=Washington Post-ABC News Poll}}</ref>  Indeed, through February 2007, such [[Opinion polling for the Democratic Party (United States) 2008 presidential candidates|opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination]] all showed Gravel with a 1% or less support level.\n\nAt the close of the first quarter 2007 reporting period, the campaign committee had $498 in cash against debts and obligations amounting to $88,515.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00423202/285065/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120021914/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00423202/285065/ |archive-date=2008-11-20 |df= }} [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] Quarterly filing for April quarter 2007</ref>\n\n===Second quarter===\nBecause of his time in the Senate, Gravel was invited to many of the early Democratic presidential debates.

He stated that the [[Iraq War]] had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the \"war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.\"  He maintained that an end to the war could be effected by a bill passed in the House and a Senate filibuster on such a bill defeated by a daily vote on cloture, but that the will to do so was lacking.  Further, he suggested a bill requiring the president to withdraw from Iraq on pain of criminal penalties. He said the recent threat of a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] in the \"war on terror\" was immoral and would be dropped under a Gravel administration, and that America has no important military enemies and it is the influence of the military-industrial complex that has conditioned Americans to think of the world in terms of enemies.  He characterized the CIA overthrow of democracy in Iran in the 1950s lies as the root of U.S. problems with that country.

He said that the fact that the other candidates knew, or should have known, that there were \"two sets of books\" being kept on intelligence from Iraq, and that they voted the resolution that authorized the war in spite of that fact, indicates that morality plays no part in their political decisions and that lack of moral judgment ought to keep them from the presidency.\n\nTwo of eight candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator.

He asserted that the prison population of the US had increased 1285% over the past 35 years and that 70% of that population is African-American. Gravel compared the legal basis for the war on drugs to Prohibition, claimed that it made criminals of people who otherwise were not criminals, and that they were disproportionately African-American. Gravel asserted that the money spent on the war in Iraq could have built 4 million houses thus helping victims of hurricane Katrina, or financed 21 million four-year college scholarships, or hired 7.6 million new teachers. Gravel said that the income tax code was especially open to corruption. That the tax code was now so complicated and corrupted that no one alive understood it. He said that with his alternative, progressive sales tax proposal everyone would know what everyone else was paying in taxes. Gravel said that equal justice before the law would only be possible if the people were empowered as lawmakers.

Along with the other candidates Gravel committed to immigration reform in his first year as president. Gravel then charged that the national immigration issue was in fact a case of scapegoating immigrants for other systemic problems in the US, in education and health care for example. Gravel said he was embarrassed that the US was building a wall on its southern border. Gravel charged that CAFTA and NAFTA were the real causes of many of the problems on both sides of the US borders but confessed that he thought remedying those acts would have to await the enactment of the National Initiative for Democracy and the empowerment of US citizens as legislators. Gravel said that instead he would reach out to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and to Castro leadership in Cuba as well. Reminded that health problems had forced Gravel into bankruptcy, Gravel was asked how he would apply his personal experience to the problem of health care. Gravel outlined his plan for healthcare vouchers, paid for out of general revenues, to be applied against premiums of up to five private plans and one government plan, each with identical defined benefits, each mandated to allow freedom of choice of provider.\n\nAll candidates were accorded equal talk times at the Univision forum.<ref>http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/09/09/23/English_transcript.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf</ref>\n\nA September 11, 2007 [[Los Angeles Times]]/Bloomberg poll found that, among registered [[South Carolina]] voters who plan to vote in the Democratic primary or usually vote for Democrats, 2% would vote for Gravel \"if the presidential primary were held today\".<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/282208/LAT-Bloomberg-Presidential-Poll-09112007 [[Scribd.com]] LAT Bloomberg Presidential Poll 09-11-2007</ref> Candidates [[Chris Dodd]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[Bill Richardson]] each got 1% of respondents to that question.

As well, he offered that he thought it futile to try to get the Congress to pass such a law, that it would instead require his proposed National Initiative and the empowering of the people to do so. Further he said that the nation could eliminate gasoline as an energy source in 5 years and all carbon based fuels in 10 years if it could just summon the will to do so, substituting wind generated electricity, for instance, for nuclear reactors as a source of power.\n\nNone of the eight candidates were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator, who accorded himself 19.42 minutes of talk-time.

Truman's racial desegregation of the US military in 1948]], he criticized former President [[Bill Clinton]] as 'dead wrong' and 'mousy' for his innovation of the '[[don't ask don't tell]]' policy covering homosexual conduct by military members:\n\n<blockquote>When Clinton got to be President, well, the first he's doing is standing there on two legs waffling back and forth, oh, don't tell us you're gay. What are you talking about? If you had any knowledge of history, ancient history, in Sparta they ''encouraged'' homosexuality because they fight for the people they love. And if it's your partner and you love them, you're prepared to die for them, and that's the same ethic you see in the military today. It's not the country. It's my partner. Go see the movies on war, and it's always the person next to me who is in my foxhole with me. Well, I got to tell you, extend that a little further and you'll see why the Spartans trained their people to be homosexuals, because they're better fighters.</blockquote>\n\nOn February 11, 2007, the senator addressed the Jefferson County Presidents Day Dinner in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gravel08.us/?q=node/381|title=Democratic Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel To Give Keynote Address At Jefferson County President's Day Dinner - Mike Gravel For President 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=gravel08.us|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn February 13, 2007, the senator released a statement outlining his views on the possibility of [[impeachment]] proceedings against President [[George W. Bush]], regarding it as 'not sufficient' and favoring a congressional inquiry which could ultimately lead to criminal charges being brought against the President.\n\nSenator Gravel participated in the AFSCME Democratic Presidential Forum on 21 February 2007 in [[Carson City, Nevada]], at the Carson City Community Center. He appears toward the end of the video of the broadcast of the event<!-- and in the video of the his participation on his Youtbe channel -->.\n\nIn the Carson City Forum, he roundly condemned President Bush's policy of military involvement in Iraq and reminded those present of his statements warning of lies and distortions about [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's supposed unlawful weapons of mass destruction]] as far back as early 2002 (the time of the occurrence of the first signs of the Bush Administration's formulation of an agenda for military action against Iraq). He decried the overall level of military spending as opposed to the funding of education and of what he regarded as the consequent, poor educational outcomes achieved.\n\nSenator Gravel called on congressional Democrats to force a 'constitutional crisis' by denying all further budgetary appropriations in aid of continued American military involvement in Iraq. He further argued that the [[income tax]] should be 'wiped out' in favor of the [[FairTax]] proposal - which imposes a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] [[sales tax]] on newly manufactured items varying from 19% to 23% while providing 'prebates' to 'untax' families spending on necessities, up to the poverty level. He stated his view that experience showed [[income taxes]] were successfully 'gamed' by the wealthy at the expense of the poor and middle income earners. And he voiced his support for the constitutional and legal reform necessary to effect the [[National Initiative]] as a means of enabling citizen-initiated national lawmaking.\n\nSenator Gravel also spoke in favor of public financial assistance for campaigning presidential candidates.\n\nOn February 26, 2007, Senator Gravel was interviewed about his campaign on the American [[C-SPAN]] network's ''[[Washington Journal]]'' program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gravel2008.com/?q=node/440|title=\u304a\u85a6\u3081\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u7dcf\u5408\u60c5\u5831\u6bd4\u8f03WEB\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|author=|date=|website=www.gravel2008.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn a February 25, 2007 [[Washington Post]]/[[ABC News]] nationwide poll of voters who lean Democratic, 0% supported Gravel for the Democratic presidential nomination.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_022607.htm | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=2010-05-12 | title=Washington Post-ABC News Poll}}</ref>  Indeed, through February 2007, such [[Opinion polling for the Democratic Party (United States) 2008 presidential candidates|opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination]] all showed Gravel with a 1% or less support level.\n\nAt the close of the first quarter 2007 reporting period, the campaign committee had $498 in cash against debts and obligations amounting to $88,515.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00423202/285065/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120021914/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00423202/285065/ |archive-date=2008-11-20 |df= }} [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] Quarterly filing for April quarter 2007</ref>\n\n===Second quarter===\nBecause of his time in the Senate, Gravel was invited to many of the early Democratic presidential debates. The first Democratic debate of the pre-primary season was in the evening of April 26, 2007, in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina]], at [[South Carolina State University]].

He stated that the [[Iraq War]] had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the \"war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis.\"  He maintained that an end to the war could be effected by a bill passed in the House and a Senate filibuster on such a bill defeated by a daily vote on cloture, but that the will to do so was lacking.  Further, he suggested a bill requiring the president to withdraw from Iraq on pain of criminal penalties. He said the recent threat of a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] in the \"war on terror\" was immoral and would be dropped under a Gravel administration, and that America has no important military enemies and it is the influence of the military-industrial complex that has conditioned Americans to think of the world in terms of enemies.  He characterized the CIA overthrow of democracy in Iran in the 1950s lies as the root of U.S. problems with that country.  Overall, he said that all American armed forces who died in Vietnam died in vain and American armed forces in Iraq were dying in vain.

Gravel claimed that the history of Southeast Asia after U.S. withdrawal showed Iraq withdrawal would not necessarily be dire, and that the insurgency in Iraq was successful because it had the support of the Iraqi people.  He said that the fact that the other candidates knew, or should have known, that there were \"two sets of books\" being kept on intelligence from Iraq, and that they voted the resolution that authorized the war in spite of that fact, indicates that morality plays no part in their political decisions and that lack of moral judgment ought to keep them from the presidency.\n\nTwo of eight candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator.

He asserted that the prison population of the US had increased 1285% over the past 35 years and that 70% of that population is African-American. Gravel compared the legal basis for the war on drugs to Prohibition, claimed that it made criminals of people who otherwise were not criminals, and that they were disproportionately African-American. Gravel asserted that the money spent on the war in Iraq could have built 4 million houses thus helping victims of hurricane Katrina, or financed 21 million four-year college scholarships, or hired 7.6 million new teachers. Gravel said that the income tax code was especially open to corruption. That the tax code was now so complicated and corrupted that no one alive understood it. He said that with his alternative, progressive sales tax proposal everyone would know what everyone else was paying in taxes. Gravel said that equal justice before the law would only be possible if the people were empowered as lawmakers.

This informal discussion was attended by seven of the eight presidential candidates, with Joe Biden not attending due to votes in Congress. ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' writer [[Matt Bai]] and DailyKos Contributing Editor and Fellow Joan McCarter moderated. The debate was broken down into Domestic Policy, Foreign Policy, and Philosophy and Leadership. Candidates were allotted 90 seconds for each question with 45 second rebuttals, although the time limits were not strictly enforced. After the debate, breakout sessions were held where convention goers could question each candidate individually.\n\nGravel expounded upon the shortcomings of representational government, concluding with, \"So the only answer is for you to realize that the answer is not up here on the dais, the answer is with you, the American people, to acquire lawmaking powers.\"  He reiterated that the U.S. Senate had the power to shut down the Iraq War with a series of forced cloture votes if they so chose.  And he talked about the effect of the concentration of the media and of money in politics, saying \"You gotta keep in mind that all politicians sort of walk in the mud. You know their head may be up here but they walk in the mud. And you have to understand that, because of the way the system is structured, you have to raise money. We're raising hundreds of millions of dollars on this dais for these people to talk to you, when we all know that money is the corrupting agent of politics, and lo and behold the media, which is now controlled in this country by five corporations, is telling us that these people who raise the most, who technically are the most corrupt, are the ones that should get to be elected.\"<!-- [http://www.yearlykosconvention.org/node/741 YearlyKos Video],--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yearlykosconvention.org/node/7|title=yearlykosconvention.org - This website is for sale! - yearlykosconvention Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.yearlykosconvention.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=944TsmjXPK0|title=TPMtv: Yearly Kos Chapter 18|first=|last=Veracifier|date=5 August 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOn August 9, 2007, Gravel participated in an LGBT network [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] hosted debate focusing on [[LGBT]] issues, moderated by [[Human Rights Campaign]] President [[Joe Solmonese]] and singer [[Melissa Etheridge]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

Asked if he believed in the [[efficacy of prayer]] Gravel replied that he believed in love, that love implements courage, and that courage fosters all the other virtues useful in life. Gravel observed that many of the people who pray are the same ones who want to go to war and thus to kill fellow human beings. Gravel said that more love between individual Americans, individual Iowans, would enable more individual courage, and that more courage would enable Americans to grapple with the problems of governance. Gravel also questioned Americans' view of their country as \"Number 1\" in the world.\n\nFive of eight candidates, Joe Biden, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator.

Along with the other candidates Gravel committed to immigration reform in his first year as president. Gravel then charged that the national immigration issue was in fact a case of scapegoating immigrants for other systemic problems in the US, in education and health care for example. Gravel said he was embarrassed that the US was building a wall on its southern border. Gravel charged that CAFTA and NAFTA were the real causes of many of the problems on both sides of the US borders but confessed that he thought remedying those acts would have to await the enactment of the National Initiative for Democracy and the empowerment of US citizens as legislators. Gravel said that instead he would reach out to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and to Castro leadership in Cuba as well. Reminded that health problems had forced Gravel into bankruptcy, Gravel was asked how he would apply his personal experience to the problem of health care. Gravel outlined his plan for healthcare vouchers, paid for out of general revenues, to be applied against premiums of up to five private plans and one government plan, each with identical defined benefits, each mandated to allow freedom of choice of provider.\n\nAll candidates were accorded equal talk times at the Univision forum.<ref>http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/09/09/23/English_transcript.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf</ref>\n\nA September 11, 2007 [[Los Angeles Times]]/Bloomberg poll found that, among registered [[South Carolina]] voters who plan to vote in the Democratic primary or usually vote for Democrats, 2% would vote for Gravel \"if the presidential primary were held today\".<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/282208/LAT-Bloomberg-Presidential-Poll-09112007 [[Scribd.com]] LAT Bloomberg Presidential Poll 09-11-2007</ref> Candidates [[Chris Dodd]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[Bill Richardson]] each got 1% of respondents to that question.

As well, he offered that he thought it futile to try to get the Congress to pass such a law, that it would instead require his proposed National Initiative and the empowering of the people to do so. Further he said that the nation could eliminate gasoline as an energy source in 5 years and all carbon based fuels in 10 years if it could just summon the will to do so, substituting wind generated electricity, for instance, for nuclear reactors as a source of power.\n\nNone of the eight candidates were accorded greater talk-time than the moderator, who accorded himself 19.42 minutes of talk-time.
