After starting to act in a London theatre club at the age of 15, he began his film career by playing [[Cedric Diggory]] in the fantasy film ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' (2005). He went on to star as [[Edward Cullen]] in the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|film adaptations]] of the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' novels]], consisting of five films between 2008 and 2012, which earned a combined total of over $3.3 billion worldwide. It brought Pattinson worldwide fame and established him among the highest-paid actors in the world. In 2010, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]], and he was featured in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100]] list.\n\nAfter starring in the romantic dramas ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]'' (2010) and ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011), Pattinson eschewed roles in big-budget films in favour of independent productions helmed by auteurs, which have earned him critical acclaim. He played a manipulative billionaire in [[David Cronenberg]]'s thriller ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]'' (2012), an aspiring actor in Cronenberg's satire ''[[Maps to the Stars]]'' (2014), an explorer in [[James Gray (film director)|James Gray]]'s adventure drama ''[[The Lost City of Z (film)|The Lost City of Z]]'' (2017), a bank robber in the [[Safdie Brothers]]' crime drama ''[[Good Time (film)|Good Time]]'' (2017), a criminal in a spaceship in [[Claire Denis]]' science fiction drama ''[[High Life (2018 film)|High Life]]'' (2018), and a troubled lighthouse keeper in [[Robert Eggers]]' horror film ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nPattinson composes and plays his own music. He sang songs for the ''Twilight'' film series and the 2008 independent comedy-drama film ''[[How to Be]]''. Since 2015, Pattinson is the ambassador of the [[GO Campaign]], a nonprofit organization that raises awareness and funds to help orphans and vulnerable children around the world. He is also a supporter of the [[End Child Prostitution and Trafficking]] (ECPAT) campaign, [[Parents and Abducted Children Together]] (PACT), is a member of [[International Medical Corps]], and has shared details about cancer through [[Public service announcement|PSAs]] to raise awareness about the disease.\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Douglas Thomas Pattinson<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting to know the \"Twilight\" actors|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/getting-to-know-the-twilight-actors-1.3314180|website=Newsday.com|year=2008|accessdate=3 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120011322/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/getting-to-know-the-twilight-actors-1.3314180|archive-date=20 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robert-pattison.html|title=Robert Pattinson Biography|website=The Biography Channel UK|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]].
