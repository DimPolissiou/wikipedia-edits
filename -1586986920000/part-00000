The genus is named after the German [[Zoology|zoologist]] [[Theodor Eimer]] (1843\u20131898).\n\n==Life cycle==\nThe ''Eimeria'' life cycle has an [[Exogeny|exogenous]] phase, during which the oocysts are excreted into the environment, and an [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] phase, where parasite development occurs in the host intestine. During the endogenous phase, several rounds of [[asexual reproduction]], or '''schizogony''' take place, after which the [[sexual differentiation]] of [[gamete]]s and [[fertilisation]] occurs. Parasite transmission occurs via the '''oral-fecal route'''. Infections are common in farming environments where many animals are confined in a small space.<ref name=\"McDonald2009\" />\n\n[[File : Eimeria life cycle usda.jpg|right|thumb|450px|''Eimeria'' life cycle]]\n\n===Oocysts===\nThere are two forms of [[Apicomplexan life cycle#oocyst|oocyst]]: sporulated or late oocyst, and unsporulated or early oocyst. An infected host releases oocysts into the environment in their unsporulated form. These contain a multi-layered cell wall making them highly resistant to environmental pressures.<ref name=Belli2006>{{cite journal  |authors=Belli SI, Smith NC, Ferguson DJP | title=The coccidian oocyst: a tough nut to crack!| journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 416\u2013423 | year = 2006| doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2004.02.005| pmid=15105014}}</ref> Once released, the unsporulated oocysts undergo [[meiosis]] upon contact with oxygen and moisture.<ref name=Ryan2000>{{cite journal  |authors=Ryan R, Shirley M, Tomley F | title=Mapping and expression of micronemes genes in ''Eimeria tenella''| journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume = 30 | issue = 14| pages = 1493\u20131499 | year = 2000| doi = 10.1016/s0020-7519(00)00116-8}}</ref> This process is known as [[spore|sporulation]] and the oocysts take approximately 2 to 7 days to become infectious.<ref name=\"WJForeyt1990\">{{Cite journal | author=Foreyt WJ| title=Coccidiosis and Cryptosporidiosis in Sheep and Goats | journal = [[Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice]] | volume=6 | issue=3 | year=1990 | pages=655\u2013670 | doi= 10.1016/S0749-0720(15)30838-0}}</ref> The sporulated oocyst is said to be '''[[tetraspore|tetrasporic]]''' meaning it contains four sporocysts, while each sporocyst is '''dizoic''', i.e. it contains two sporozoites.<ref name=Fayer1980/>\n\nOnce ingested, the oocysts undergo a process called excystation, whereby thousands of sporozoites are released into lumen of the intestine. In the case of ''E. tenella'', this process is thought to occur due to the combination of enzymatic degradation and mechanical abrasion of the oocyst wall in the chicken's [[gizzard]].<ref name=Lal2009>{{Cite journal | author=Lal K|display-authors=etal| title=Proteomic comparison of four ''Eimeria tenella'' life-cycle stages: Unsporulated oocyst, sporulated oocyst, sporozoite and second-generation merozoite | journal = [[Proteomics (journal)|Proteomics]] | volume=9| issue=19 | year=2009 | pages=4566\u20134576 | doi= 10.1002/pmic.200900305| pmid=19795439 | pmc=2947549}}</ref>\n\n===Sporozoites===\nThe motile [[Apicomplexan life cycle#sporozoite|sporozoites]] invade the [[enterocyte]]s of small intestine, and migrate to their respective sites of development. Invasion is mediated through specialised membrane-bound structures on the surface of the parasite that release secretions. This results in the recognition of, and attachment to [[Host (biology)|host cell]] [[Cell surface receptor|receptor]]s. This process is known as [[gliding motility]], which is conserved across all species of ''[[Apicomplexa]]''. Membrane glyconjugates have been proposed as potential host cell receptors for ''Eimeria'' species.<ref name=\"Augustine2000\">{{Cite journal | author=Augustine PC| title=Cellular invasion by avian ''Eimeria'' species | journal = [[Poultry and Avian Biology Reviews]] | volume=11 | year=2000 | pages=113\u2013122 | doi= 10.1016/S0020-7519(00)00150-8| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259609 }}</ref> After invasion, the sporozoites develop into [[Apicomplexan life cycle#trophozoite|trophozoite]]s, then into [[schizont]]s, where they undergo several rounds of [[asexual reproduction]]. This results in many [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] developing within the schizont. Each nucleus develops into a [[Apicomplexan life cycle#merozoite|merozoite]].<ref name=Fayer1980/>\n\nInvasion requires the formation of a '''moving junction''' between parasite and host [[cell membrane]]s. In ''E. tenella'', this involves parasite [[microneme]]s and [[rhoptry]] proteins including RON2, RON5 and AMA-2.<ref name=Lal2009/> It is unlikely that the host cell is completely passive in the invasion process, although evidence of host physical forces that assist in mediating parasite entry remains controversial.\n\n===Merozoites===\nWhen '''schizonts''' rupture, merozoites are released, which either go on to re-infect more [[enterocytes]] or develop into either male or female [[gametes]] via the process of [[gametogenesis]]. These gametes fuse to form an oocyst, which is then released in its non-infectious, unsporulated form through the faeces of the host.\n\nMerozoite invasion also requires the formation of a moving junction, however the [[protein]]s involved in this process differs from those on sporozoites. [[Rhoptry]] proteins AMA-1 and RON4 are found exclusively on merozoites. There is also a greater diversity of '''variant surface antigens''' found on the surface of merozoites. It is hypothesised that this may be due to the fact that merozoites are short-lived and a greater [[antigen]] repertoire would permit faster binding and invasion.<ref name=Lal2009/>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File : Apicomplexa tree..png|right|thumb|350px|Evolutionary relationships among [[Apicomplexa]] ]]\n\nThe ''Eimeria'' lie within the family [[Eimeriidae]].

The genus is named after the German [[Zoology|zoologist]] [[Theodor Eimer]] (1843\u20131898).\n\n==Life cycle==\nThe ''Eimeria'' life cycle has an [[Exogeny|exogenous]] phase, during which the oocysts are excreted into the environment, and an [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] phase, where parasite development occurs in the host intestine. During the endogenous phase, several rounds of [[asexual reproduction]], or '''schizogony''' take place, after which the [[sexual differentiation]] of [[gamete]]s and [[fertilisation]] occurs. Parasite transmission occurs via the '''oral-fecal route'''. Infections are common in farming environments where many animals are confined in a small space.<ref name=\"McDonald2009\" />\n\n[[File : Eimeria life cycle usda.jpg|right|thumb|450px|''Eimeria'' life cycle]]\n\n===Oocysts===\nThere are two forms of [[Apicomplexan life cycle#oocyst|oocyst]]: sporulated or late oocyst, and unsporulated or early oocyst. An infected host releases oocysts into the environment in their unsporulated form. These contain a multi-layered cell wall making them highly resistant to environmental pressures.<ref name=Belli2006>{{cite journal  |authors=Belli SI, Smith NC, Ferguson DJP | title=The coccidian oocyst: a tough nut to crack!| journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 416\u2013423 | year = 2006| doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2004.02.005| pmid=15105014}}</ref> Once released, the unsporulated oocysts undergo [[meiosis]] upon contact with oxygen and moisture.<ref name=Ryan2000>{{cite journal  |authors=Ryan R, Shirley M, Tomley F | title=Mapping and expression of micronemes genes in ''Eimeria tenella''| journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume = 30 | issue = 14| pages = 1493\u20131499 | year = 2000| doi = 10.1016/s0020-7519(00)00116-8}}</ref> This process is known as [[spore|sporulation]] and the oocysts take approximately 2 to 7 days to become infectious.<ref name=\"WJForeyt1990\">{{Cite journal | author=Foreyt WJ| title=Coccidiosis and Cryptosporidiosis in Sheep and Goats | journal = [[Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice]] | volume=6 | issue=3 | year=1990 | pages=655\u2013670 | doi= 10.1016/S0749-0720(15)30838-0}}</ref> The sporulated oocyst is said to be '''[[tetraspore|tetrasporic]]''' meaning it contains four sporocysts, while each sporocyst is '''dizoic''', i.e. it contains two sporozoites.<ref name=Fayer1980/>\n\nOnce ingested, the oocysts undergo a process called excystation, whereby thousands of sporozoites are released into lumen of the intestine. In the case of ''E. tenella'', this process is thought to occur due to the combination of enzymatic degradation and mechanical abrasion of the oocyst wall in the chicken's [[gizzard]].<ref name=Lal2009>{{Cite journal | author=Lal K|display-authors=etal| title=Proteomic comparison of four ''Eimeria tenella'' life-cycle stages: Unsporulated oocyst, sporulated oocyst, sporozoite and second-generation merozoite | journal = [[Proteomics (journal)|Proteomics]] | volume=9| issue=19 | year=2009 | pages=4566\u20134576 | doi= 10.1002/pmic.200900305| pmid=19795439 | pmc=2947549}}</ref>\n\n===Sporozoites===\nThe motile [[Apicomplexan life cycle#sporozoite|sporozoites]] invade the [[enterocyte]]s of small intestine, and migrate to their respective sites of development. Invasion is mediated through specialised membrane-bound structures on the surface of the parasite that release secretions. This results in the recognition of, and attachment to [[Host (biology)|host cell]] [[Cell surface receptor|receptor]]s. This process is known as [[gliding motility]], which is conserved across all species of ''[[Apicomplexa]]''. Membrane glyconjugates have been proposed as potential host cell receptors for ''Eimeria'' species.<ref name=\"Augustine2000\">{{Cite journal | author=Augustine PC| title=Cellular invasion by avian ''Eimeria'' species | journal = [[Poultry and Avian Biology Reviews]] | volume=11 | year=2000 | pages=113\u2013122 | doi= 10.1016/S0020-7519(00)00150-8| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259609 }}</ref> After invasion, the sporozoites develop into [[Apicomplexan life cycle#trophozoite|trophozoite]]s, then into [[schizont]]s, where they undergo several rounds of [[asexual reproduction]]. This results in many [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] developing within the schizont. Each nucleus develops into a [[Apicomplexan life cycle#merozoite|merozoite]].<ref name=Fayer1980/>\n\nInvasion requires the formation of a '''moving junction''' between parasite and host [[cell membrane]]s. In ''E. tenella'', this involves parasite [[microneme]]s and [[rhoptry]] proteins including RON2, RON5 and AMA-2.<ref name=Lal2009/> It is unlikely that the host cell is completely passive in the invasion process, although evidence of host physical forces that assist in mediating parasite entry remains controversial.\n\n===Merozoites===\nWhen '''schizonts''' rupture, merozoites are released, which either go on to re-infect more [[enterocytes]] or develop into either male or female [[gametes]] via the process of [[gametogenesis]]. These gametes fuse to form an oocyst, which is then released in its non-infectious, unsporulated form through the faeces of the host.\n\nMerozoite invasion also requires the formation of a moving junction, however the [[protein]]s involved in this process differs from those on sporozoites. [[Rhoptry]] proteins AMA-1 and RON4 are found exclusively on merozoites. There is also a greater diversity of '''variant surface antigens''' found on the surface of merozoites. It is hypothesised that this may be due to the fact that merozoites are short-lived and a greater [[antigen]] repertoire would permit faster binding and invasion.<ref name=Lal2009/>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File : Apicomplexa tree..png|right|thumb|350px|Evolutionary relationships among [[Apicomplexa]] ]]\n\nThe ''Eimeria'' lie within the family [[Eimeriidae]].

In turn, there are a few factors that are likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism.\n\n*[[Democracy]]: Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C. Mancini, Paolo|title=Comparing media systems : three models of media and politics|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-511-21075-2|oclc=896991703}}</ref> Also, a low level of press censorship, state intervention, and institutional control are ensured at the same time.\n* Audience orientation: Audience orientation is one of the factors that affects the performance of journalistic roles. For instance, in China, market newspapers are more likely to play a role as the watchdog journalism than an official newspaper, which is supposed to publicize corruptions of people with power such as how they misuse existing policy or law, does <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Haiyan|last2=Sparks|first2=Colin|last3=Huang|first3=Yu|date=September 2018|title=Measuring differences in the Chinese press: A study of People's Daily and Southern Metropolitan Daily|journal=Global Media and China|volume=3|issue=3|pages=125\u2013140|doi=10.1177/2059436418806022|issn=2059-4364|doi-access=free}}</ref> At this point, there is a huge difference in reporting styles between popular press and elite press.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skovsgaard|first=Morten|last2=Alb\u00e6k|first2=Erik|last3=Bro|first3=Peter|last4=de Vreese|first4=Claes|date=2012-04-13|title=A reality check: How journalists' role perceptions impact their implementation of the objectivity norm|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|volume=14|issue=1|pages=22\u201342|doi=10.1177/1464884912442286|issn=1464-8849}}</ref>\n* Media political leaning: The political orientation of the journalism is closely associated to the performance of the watchdog role. To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandals.\n* News beats: The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization. For instance, based on what Reich (2012) found, journalists who deal with political issues are highly likely to act as watchdogs than ones who cover business issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reich|first=Zvi|date=2011-09-20|title=Different Practices, Similar Logic|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=76\u201399|doi=10.1177/1940161211420868|issn=1940-1612}}</ref> Similar tendency appears in other countries including China, Chile, and Spain.

The detached watchdog journalism is predominant especially in the western countries such as Germany, the United States, Austria, and Switzerland.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn the detached approach, the most predominant form of watchdog journalism, criticism and question which are done by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny.

To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism these days ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world.

As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered. So instead of reporting on fraud, abuse, and waste, useless and meaningless topics will be handled as if they are the only a problem that a community faces.<ref name=\":3\" /> For instance, a corruption which is related to various public infrastructures such as hospital that require more resource with a high quality to provide better service to public will be less likely to be told.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<br />\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/ Nieman Watchdog: Questions the Press Should Ask]'' \u2013 Official site ([[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] at [[Harvard University]]).\n* ''[https://www.newsmediawatchdog.com/ News Media Watchdog]''\n\n{{Journalism footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watchdog Journalism}}\n[[Category:Watchdog journalism| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Journalism that plays an oversight role towards government, industry and society}}\n{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n\n'''Watchdog journalism''' must inform the general wrongdoings of people in power as their doings directly affect the public.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Salas|first=Branden|title=Basic Concept of Journalism|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|year=2018|isbn=9781839472886|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\n* [[Fact-checking]]: Checking validity and integrity of government officials and corporate executives.<ref name=\":10\" />\n* [[Interviewing]]: Interviewing normal individuals and figuring out what problems and concerns they have.<ref name=\":10\" />\n* [[Beat reporting]]: Gathering information and evidence that public may be unable to do and observing the society in a broader context.<ref name=\":10\" />\n* [[Investigative journalism]]: Focusing on one specific issue for a long time and preparing to make a change in a society through a scrutiny and investigation.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n\n\nSimply put, the role of watchdog journalism exactly does same job with what a guard dog does.

As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism these days ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered. So instead of reporting on fraud, abuse, and waste, useless and meaningless topics will be handled as if they are the only a problem that a community faces.<ref name=\":3\" /> For instance, a corruption which is related to various public infrastructures such as hospital that require more resource with a high quality to provide better service to public will be less likely to be told.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<br />\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/ Nieman Watchdog: Questions the Press Should Ask]'' \u2013 Official site ([[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] at [[Harvard University]]).\n* ''[https://www.newsmediawatchdog.com/ News Media Watchdog]''\n\n{{Journalism footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watchdog Journalism}}\n[[Category:Watchdog journalism| ]]\n", "name_user": "Dahlsydney", "label": "safe", "comment": "small grammatical errors in \"lead\" section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_journalism"}

It won 12,811 votes (0.82%), just 2,857 (0.18%) short of the [[electoral threshold]] at the time (1%) for winning a Knesset seat. The party was even less successful in the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|1977 elections]], winning only 4,836 votes.\n\nIn 1980, Kahane was arrested for the 62nd time since his emigration, and he was jailed for six months after a detention order that was based on allegations of him planning armed attacks against [[Palestinians]] in response to the killings of Jewish settlers.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KnwxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=baQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3057,1747482&dq=kahane+arrested&hl=en Israelis arrest rabbi on terrorism charges], The Montreal Gazette May 15, 1980</ref> Kahane was held in prison in [[Ramla]], where he wrote the book ''They Must Go''.

In 1984, the [[Israeli Central Elections Committee]] banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy.<ref>Israel Court Drops Ban on 2 Political Parties, New York Times, June 29, 1984, p. 3</ref> The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass a law excluding racist parties from future elections. The Knesset responded in 1985 by amending the \"Basic Law:Knesset\" to include a prohibition (paragraph 7a) against registration of parties that explicitly or implicitly incite racism.\n\n=== Election to Knesset ===\nIn the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 legislative elections]], Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, gaining one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard [[oath of office]] and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from [[Psalms]] to indicate that national laws were overruled by the [[Torah]] if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the [[Land of Israel]], revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. \n\nWhile his popularity in Israel grew, Kahane was boycotted in the Knesset, where his speeches were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].<ref name=\"cut down\">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine</ref> Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G. Freedman</ref>\n\nIn 1985, the Knesset passed an amendment to the [[Basic Law of Israel]], barring political parties that incited to racism. The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M. Dershowitz]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Chutzpah|year=1992|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0-671-76089-2|author=Alan M.

As a result of this legislation, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship. Following his banning from the Knesset, he tried to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated on the basis of the fact that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. It was not reinstated, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/immigrationlaw/chapter12.html |title=Concepts of Citizenship  |author=Weissbrodt, David and Danielson, Laura |date=2004 |website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  |publisher= |access-date=July 28, 2019|quote=Kahane was a U.S. citizen at birth. He moved to Israel where he became active in politics and was elected to the Israeli Parliament. Kahane, aware of the fact that accepting an office under a foreign government was an expatriating act listed in INA 349 (a)(4), communicated on several occasions with the State Department that he did not intend to give up his U.S. citizenship. The State Department nonetheless claimed that Kahane committed the expatriating act by shifting his allegiance to Israel. The court rejected this argument because an actor who contemporaneously with the expatriating act declares his intent to stay a U.S. citizen automatically preserves his citizenship. Kahane v. Shultz (E.D.N.Y.1987). One year later, the Israeli Parliament passed a law providing that its members could only be Israeli citizens. Kahane executed a formal oath of renunciation of his U.S. citizenship to remain eligible for a seat in the Parliament. After Kahane's party was barred, on different grounds, from running in the elections, Kahane tried to revoke his renunciation of U.S. citizenship claiming that the Israeli law compelled his act. The court ruled against Kahane, who remained expatriated, although he was permitted to visit the United States and was eventually assassinated in New York City. Kahane v.

He also noted, \"[[Democracy]] and [[Judaism]] are not the same thing.\"<ref>\"One absolutely cannot confuse them. The objective of a democratic state is to allow a person to do exactly as he wishes.

He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\">Kahane.org</ref> \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]\" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\".<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/>\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel.

They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war, and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}</ref> However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including [[Yamit]]. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the [[River Jordan|Jordan River]], hence part of what is now Jordan.

In 1984, the [[Israeli Central Elections Committee]] banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy.<ref>Israel Court Drops Ban on 2 Political Parties, New York Times, June 29, 1984, p. 3</ref> The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass a law excluding racist parties from future elections. The Knesset responded in 1985 by amending the \"Basic Law:Knesset\" to include a prohibition (paragraph 7a) against registration of parties that explicitly or implicitly incite racism.\n\n=== Election to Knesset ===\nIn the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 legislative elections]], Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, gaining one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard [[oath of office]] and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from [[Psalms]] to indicate that national laws were overruled by the [[Torah]] if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the [[Land of Israel]], revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. \n\nWhile his popularity in Israel grew, Kahane was boycotted in the Knesset, where his speeches were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].<ref name=\"cut down\">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine</ref> Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G.

The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M.

As a result of this legislation, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship. Following his banning from the Knesset, he tried to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated on the basis of the fact that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. It was not reinstated, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/immigrationlaw/chapter12.html |title=Concepts of Citizenship  |author=Weissbrodt, David and Danielson, Laura |date=2004 |website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  |publisher= |access-date=July 28, 2019|quote=Kahane was a U.S. citizen at birth.

Kahane, aware of the fact that accepting an office under a foreign government was an expatriating act listed in INA 349 (a)(4), communicated on several occasions with the State Department that he did not intend to give up his U.S. citizenship. The State Department nonetheless claimed that Kahane committed the expatriating act by shifting his allegiance to Israel. The court rejected this argument because an actor who contemporaneously with the expatriating act declares his intent to stay a U.S. citizen automatically preserves his citizenship. Kahane v. Shultz (E.D.N.Y.1987). One year later, the Israeli Parliament passed a law providing that its members could only be Israeli citizens. Kahane executed a formal oath of renunciation of his U.S. citizenship to remain eligible for a seat in the Parliament. After Kahane's party was barred, on different grounds, from running in the elections, Kahane tried to revoke his renunciation of U.S. citizenship claiming that the Israeli law compelled his act.

He was eulogized by a number of prominent supporters in both the U.S. and in Israel, including Rabbi [[Moshe Tendler]] and the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, [[Mordechai Eliyahu]], who spoke of how little the people understood of Kahane's \"true value\".<ref>\"Gentlemen, not everyone knows Rabbi Meir! They do not know his true value! His fear of heaven! His learning! His kindness! The help he gave in secret! How many families receive food products from him on the eve of Passover, the eve of Sukkoth, the eve of Rosh HaShana; how many poor people got money from him \u2013 and all this, giving in secret! I can tell you that just recently, before Rosh HaShana, Rabbi Meir handed out some 34,000 dollars. There was a family that needed money, so he took money from his private funds and gave them! This is kindness! This is fear of heaven! This is charity! This is giving in secret! His inner qualities, the delicacy of his soul, his inner fear of heaven! This, people do not know, with this they are not familiar. Gentlemen! As if we know how carefully he used to fix times for Torah study! Who was the first to speak of Russian Jewry? Who awakened the Israeli people and the entire world from their slumbers, with regard to Russian Jewry? Who was it who predicted that Russian Jews would yet come out of their exile? It was Rabbi Meir Kahane \u2013 may God avenge his blood! I can mention now the number of agunoth I asked him to act on behalf of \u2013 thanks to his efforts we succeeded in saving a goodly number of agunoth. He saved many Jewish women from non-Jewish hands! Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Meir! I ask of you to rise up to heaven and to awaken all those who were put to death by the authorities, so that they can act in heaven for the benefit of all of Israel, so that we need not mourn any more, and so that your own sacrifice will be the last one, so that crying and screaming shall no longer be heard in our day, and so that we be found worthy of the final redemption, speedily and in our day.

He also noted, \"[[Democracy]] and [[Judaism]] are not the same thing.\"<ref>\"One absolutely cannot confuse them. The objective of a democratic state is to allow a person to do exactly as he wishes.

He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\">Kahane.org</ref> \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]\" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\".<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/>\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel. The Arabs who call themselves 'Palestinians' had the opportunity to create a 'Palestine' in a far larger part of the Land of Israel, but refused to do so. They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war, and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}</ref> However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including [[Yamit]]. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the [[River Jordan|Jordan River]], hence part of what is now Jordan. [[Land of Israel|Eretz Yisrael]] also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the [[Euphrates River]].\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> When critics suggested that following Kahane's plans would mean a perpetual war between Jews and Arabs, Kahane responded, \"There will be a perpetual war.

Eliyahu wrote, \"Only the Torah way interested Kahane, which he constantly toiled over and which served as his strength... When one considers the depth and clarity of [Kahane's] works, one is astonished at how he had the time to compile such.
