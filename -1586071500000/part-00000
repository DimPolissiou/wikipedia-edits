An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]].

The [[Greater Poland uprising (1846)|Greater Poland uprising]] ended in a fiasco in early 1846. In the [[Krak\u00f3w uprising]] of February 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow]] into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units. This resulted in the [[Galician slaughter]] of 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> a large-scale rebellion of [[serfdom|serf]]s seeking relief from their post-feudal condition of [[Serfdom in Poland|mandatory labor]] as practiced in ''[[folwark]]s''. The uprising freed many from bondage and hastened decisions that led to the [[abolition of serfdom in Poland|abolition of Polish serfdom]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1848. A new wave of Polish involvement in revolutionary movements soon took place in the partitions and in other parts of Europe in the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] revolutions of 1848 (e.g. [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]'s participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions in Austria]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]]).

During large-scale demonstrations in Warsaw, Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"[[Whites (January Uprising)|White]]\", or [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals. In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the government of Congress Poland, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The uprising lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.<ref name=\"Gierowski 287\u2013311\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=287\u2013311}}.</ref><ref name=\"Biel, czerwie\u0144, czer\u0144\">{{Harvnb|Zdrada|2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland]] along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (an [[academy of sciences]]) was founded in Krak\u00f3w in 1872.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/>\n\nSocial activities termed \"[[organic work]]\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and work on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses, industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref>\n\n[[Positivism in Poland]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=182\u2013187}}.</ref><ref name=\"Lukowski 192\u2013194\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=192\u2013194}}.</ref> It reflected the ideals and values of the emerging urban [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=66\u201367}}.</ref> Around 1890, the urban classes gradually abandoned the positivist ideas and came under the influence of modern pan-European [[nationalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=297\u2013298}}.</ref>\n\n====Economic development and social change====\n\n[[File:Gierymski Feast of trumpets I.jpg|thumb|right|Many [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]] emigrated from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most remained to form a large [[Minority group|ethnic minority]]]]\n\nUnder the partitioning powers, economic diversification and progress, including large-scale [[industrialisation]], were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. Advanced agriculture was practiced in the Prussian Partition, except for [[Upper Silesia]], where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns took place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=187\u2013192, 199}}.</ref> The industrial initiative, capital and know-how were provided largely by entrepreneurs who were not ethnic Poles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=294}}.</ref> Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of urban population, making the region the most economically advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production there by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside of Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized [[Cieszyn Silesia]] area. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad.

The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897.

In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition. Ethnically Polish settlement spread over a large area further to the east, including its greatest concentration in the [[Vilnius Region]], amounted to only over 20% of that number.<ref name=\"Lukowski 208\u2013216\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=208\u2013216}}.</ref>\n \nPolish paramilitary organizations oriented toward independence, such as the [[Union of Active Struggle]], were formed in 1908\u20131914, mainly in Galicia.

At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.

An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989\u2013present)|modern Polish state]], the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prehistory and protohistory==\n\n{{further|Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|Poland in the Early Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Biskupin_brama_od_wewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]\n\nIn [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over a period of at least 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''.

The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government.

New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education.

[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad.

The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914 and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217\u2013222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279\u2013290}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy Paderewski 02.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] was a pianist and a statesman]]\n\nDue to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915.

According to the language criterion of the [[Polish census of 1931]], the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the [[Yiddish]] language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of [[Ukrainian language]] schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\nThe population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939. However, the overall economic situation in the interwar period was one of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. There was little money for investment inside Poland, and few foreigners were interested in investing there.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> Total industrial production barely increased between 1913 and 1939 (within the area delimited by the 1939 borders), but because of population growth (from 26.3 million in 1919 to 34.8 million in 1939),<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> the ''per capita'' output actually decreased by 18%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=360}}.</ref>\n\nConditions in the predominant agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, which resulted in rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to [[Norman Davies]], the failures of the Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses by the end of the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more repressive regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\n===Final Sanation years (1935\u20131939)===\n\n[[File:Sk\u0142adkowski premierem.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A year after Pi\u0142sudski's death, his former personal assistant General [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]] became the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s last prime minister]]\n\nAfter Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935, Poland was governed until (and initially during) the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of 1939]] by old allies and subordinates known as \"[[Pi\u0142sudski's colonels]]\".

{"title_page": "Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2018}}\n'''Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers''' and '''Viscountess Savage''' (1581 \u2013 9 March 1650) was an [[Kingdom of England|English]] courtier and a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] victim of uprisings during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Hon. Elizabeth Darcy, she was the daughter of [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Earl Rivers]] and Mary Kitson (died 1644), a granddaughter of [[Thomas Kitson]].\n\n==Marriage==\nOn 14 May 1602, Elizabeth married [[Thomas Savage, 1st Viscount Savage|Thomas Savage]] and they had eleven sons and eight daughters. He was the eldest son of [[Sir John Savage, 1st Baronet]] and his wife Mary ''n\u00e9e'' Allington, from whom he inherited [[Melford Hall]] in [[Suffolk]]. In 1615, he inherited his father's baronetcy and was created [[Viscount Savage]] in 1626. On his death in 1635, Elizabeth (by now Viscountess Savage) inherited Melford. This and [[St Osyth Priory]] in [[Essex]] formed her principal residences.\n\nOn the death of Lady Savage's father in 1640, the earldom of Rivers passed to her eldest son, [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers|John]]. As compensation for not enjoying the rank of a countess, she was created Countess Rivers [[Pre-1876 Life Peerages|for life]] in 1641.\n\n==Allegiances==\nAs well as inheriting property and being raised in rank following the death of her father and husband, she also inherited their political and religious allegiances that would later lead to her downfall in the [[English Civil War]]. Both men were closely associated with [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], had links with [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and both had enforced the king's policies for Essex in the case of Lord Rivers and [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]] in the case of Lord Savage. Lady Rivers and her husband had both served in [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]]'s court as a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] and Chancellor respectively, due to the family's strong [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] links. Lady Rivers' father had been suspected of being a [[Papist]], but was protected against [[recusancy]] legislation, although he was excluded from the county [[magistrate|magistracy]].\n\n==Civil War==\nFollowing parliament's explanation of the ineffectual settlement with the king to have been caused by a Catholic conspiracy, local grievances heightened rumour and suspicion and Lady Rivers was presented to the Essex [[justices of the peace]] as a [[recusant]] and her home at St Osyth was searched for [[weapon|arms]]. Following the attack on [[John Lucas (royalist)|Sir John Lucas]] at [[Colchester]] during the [[Stour Valley riots]], St Osyth was ransacked and plundered by the crowds. Forewarned, Lady Rivers had fled to [[Long Melford]] but the crowds followed her there, attempting to also destroy that residence. According to a local story, Lady Rivers, upon also escaping Melford, threw a box with a string of [[pearl]]s into a nearby pond before fleeing.\n\n==Later life==\nAlthough attacked by the masses in opposition to her family's association with the king and their religious patronage, Lady Rivers secured support from those who did not share the same views. Parliament later ordered her estates to be restored to her, but her [[leasehold estate|tenants]] subsequently refused to pay [[renting|rent]]. After a second episode of invasion of her estates by Parliamentarian soldiers, she sought permission to go to [[France]] in May 1643. After her return, she successfully petitioned Parliament to have her estates restored again, but the attacks on them and the fines imposed upon her and her son left her penniless. On her death in 1651, she was said to have been bankrupt and was buried at St Osyth with her ancestors.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Lady Rivers' father had been suspected of being a [[Papist]], but was protected against [[recusancy]] legislation, although he was excluded from the county [[magistrate|magistracy]].\n\n==Civil War==\nFollowing parliament's explanation of the ineffectual settlement with the king to have been caused by a Catholic conspiracy, local grievances heightened rumour and suspicion and Lady Rivers was presented to the Essex [[justices of the peace]] as a [[recusant]] and her home at St Osyth was searched for [[weapon|arms]]. Following the attack on [[John Lucas (royalist)|Sir John Lucas]] at [[Colchester]] during the [[Stour Valley riots]], St Osyth was ransacked and plundered by the crowds. Forewarned, Lady Rivers had fled to [[Long Melford]] but the crowds followed her there, attempting to also destroy that residence. According to a local story, Lady Rivers, upon also escaping Melford, threw a box with a string of [[pearl]]s into a nearby pond before fleeing.\n\n==Later life==\nAlthough attacked by the masses in opposition to her family's association with the king and their religious patronage, Lady Rivers secured support from those who did not share the same views. Parliament later ordered her estates to be restored to her, but her [[leasehold estate|tenants]] subsequently refused to pay [[renting|rent]]. After a second episode of invasion of her estates by Parliamentarian soldiers, she sought permission to go to [[France]] in May 1643. After her return, she successfully petitioned Parliament to have her estates restored again, but the attacks on them and the fines imposed upon her and her son left her penniless. On her death in 1651, she was said to have been bankrupt and was buried at St Osyth with her ancestors.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

{"title_page": "Magic in Harry Potter", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magic in ''Harry Potter''}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, [[Magic in fiction|magic]] is depicted as a supernatural force that can be used to override the usual [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Many fictional [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter|magical creatures]] exist in the series, while ordinary creatures also sometimes exhibit magical properties. [[Magical objects in Harry Potter|Magical objects]] are also described. The small number of humans who are able to perform magic (witches and wizards) refer to the rest of the population, oblivious to the existence of magic, as \"[[Muggle]]s\" in the United Kingdom and \"No-Maj\" in the United States.\n\nIn humans, magic or the lack thereof is an inborn attribute. It is inherited, carried on \"dominant resilient genes\".<ref>{{cite news|title = FAQ jkrowling.com|url = http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042840/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19|archivedate=21 July 2011|accessdate = 8 May 2017}}</ref> Magic is the norm for the children of magical couples and less common in those of Muggles. Exceptions exist: those unable to do magic who are born to magical parents are known as [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Squibs|Squibs]], whereas a witch or wizard born to Muggle parents is known as a [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]], or by the [[derogatory term]] \"Mudblood\". While Muggle-borns are quite common, Squibs are extremely rare.\n\nRowling based many magical elements of the ''Harry Potter'' universe on real-world mythology and magic. She has described this as \"a way of giving texture to the world\".<ref>{{cite episode|series=Harry Potter: A History of Magic|network=BBC|date=28 October 2017}}</ref> The books present the idea that the Muggle interpretation of these stories is a distorted version of what goes on in the wizarding world. \n\nThe magic of ''Harry Potter'' became the subject of a 2017 [[British Library]] exhibition and accompanying documentary. The exhibition, entitled ''Harry Potter: A History of Magic'', is the first at the British Library to be inspired by a single series by a living author.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Harry Potter's 20th birthday to be marked with British Library show|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/08/harry-potters-20th-birthday-to-be-marked-with-british-library-show|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2017|date=8 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Using magic==\nWitches and wizards need training to learn how to control their magic. With young and untrained children, magic will manifest itself subconsciously in moments of strong apprehension, fear, anger and sadness.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41 |title=J.K Rowling Official Site |accessdate=27 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926035344/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41 |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For example, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] once made his hair grow back after a bad haircut, set a boa constrictor on his cousin [[Dursley family#Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] at the London Zoo, and made [[Dursley family#Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]] inflate to an enormous size. While this reaction is usually uncontrollable, as an untrained child, [[Lord Voldemort]] was able to make things move without touching them, make animals do what he wanted without training them, make \"bad things happen to people\" who annoyed him, or make them hurt if he wanted to.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch13\">{{HP6}}, chapter 13</ref> In addition, [[Lily Potter]] was able to guide and control the blooming of a flower by wanting to.\n\nAlmost all magic is done with the use of a  [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]]. On the subject of wandless magic, Rowling says:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |title=2001: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K Rowling interviews on the web |accessdate=27 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827220619/http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |archivedate=27 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{cquote|You can do unfocused and uncontrolled magic without a wand (for instance when Harry blows up Aunt Marge) but to do really good spells, yes, you need a wand.}} \nA wizard or witch is only at their best when using their own wand. When using another's wand, one's spells are not as strong as they normally would be.{{HP1}}\n\nWithin the books, technical details of magic are obscure. Of Harry's lessons, only those involving [[magical beasts (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]], [[Potions in Harry Potter|potions]] or divination are given in any detail.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] once told [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] that \"Time and space matter in magic\" during Harry's first Occlumency lesson in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] told Harry after finding the magically concealed boat to reach the locket [[Horcrux]] that \"Magic always leaves traces, sometimes very distinctive traces.\"{{HP6}}\n\n=== Spellcasting ===\n[[Spell (paranormal)|Spells]] are the every-purpose tools of a wizard or witch; short bursts of magic used to accomplish single specialised tasks such as opening locks or creating fire. Typically casting requires an [[incantation]], most often in a modified form of [[Latin]] (see [[Dog Latin]]), and gesturing with a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]]. However, Rowling has revealed that particularly talented wizards can cast spells without the aid of wand, although magic produced with one is generally more precise and powerful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en|title=History of Magic in North America|website=[[Pottermore]]|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Spells can also be cast non-verbally, but with a magical wand. This special technique is taught in the sixth year of study at Hogwarts and requires the caster to concentrate on the incantation. Some spells (e.g. ''Levicorpus'') are apparently designed to be used non-verbally. While most magic shown in the books requires the caster to use their voice, some do not (and this may depend on the witch or wizard). Dumbledore has been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking, such as [[conjuring]] enough squashy purple sleeping bags to accommodate the entire student population{{HP3}} or during his duel with Voldemort towards the end of ''Order of the Phoenix''.\n\nIt is possible to use a wand without holding it. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', Harry himself performs ''Lumos'' to light his wand when it is lying on the ground somewhere near him.{{HP5}} Additionally, [[Animagus|Animagi]] and [[Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagi]] do not need wands to undergo their transformations.\n\nSpells are divided into rough categories, such as \"[[Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|charm]]s\", \"[[curse]]s\", \"hexes\", or \"[[jinx]]es\". Although offensive and potentially dangerous curses exist in number, three are considered usable only for great evil, which earns them the special classification of \"[[#Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]\".\n\n== The limits of magic ==\nBefore publishing the first ''Harry Potter'' novel, Rowling spent five years establishing the limitations of magic\u2014determining what it could and could not do. \"The most important thing to decide when you're creating a fantasy world,\" she said in 2000, \"is what the characters ''can't'' do.\" For instance, while it is possible to conjure things out of thin air, it is far more tricky to create something that fits an exact specification rather than a general one; moreover, any objects so conjured tend not to last.<ref name=\"accio-quote.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/therules.htm |title= JKR quotes about \"the rules\" of Harry Potter's Wizarding World: |accessdate=27 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nRowling has described death as the most important theme in the books.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Harry Potter and Me|network=BBC|date=28 December 2001|transcript=Accio Quote|transcript-url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm}}</ref> Consequently, as Dumbledore states in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', there is no spell that can truly bring the dead back to life. While corpses can be transformed into obedient [[#Inferius|Inferi]] on a living wizard's command, they are little more than [[zombies]] with no soul or will of their own. However, there are some methods of communicating with the dead, though with limited results. For example, all Hogwarts headmasters appear in a [[Magical portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] when they die, allowing consultation by future generations. It is also possible through the rare [[#Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect to converse with ghost-like \"shadows\" of magically murdered people. The [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Resurrection Stone|Resurrection Stone]] also allows one to talk to the dead, but those brought back by the Stone are not corporeal, nor do they wish to be disturbed from their peaceful rest. Throughout the series, this limit is continually mentioned, and wizards try to transcend it at their own peril.\n\nLikewise, it is not possible to make oneself immortal unless one makes use of an object of great power to sustain life, such as the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] or [[Horcrux]]es. If one were to possess the three [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]], it is fabled that they would possess the tools to become the \"master of death\". However, it is hinted that to be a true \"master of death\" is to be willing to accept that death is inevitable. Other methods of extending life include drinking unicorn blood, which will keep a person alive even if death is imminent, but at the terrible price of being cursed forever. Being magical can contribute to one's [[longevity]], as there are several characters in the series who are unusually long-lived (such as [[Griselda Marchbanks]], who was an [[Exam invigilator|invigilator]] during Albus Dumbledore's O.W.L examinations). It is revealed by [[Nearly Headless Nick]] in the fifth book that all witches and wizards have the choice of becoming [[Ghosts (Harry Potter)|ghosts]] upon dying; however, it is described as \"a pale imitation of life\". Snape states that a ghost is merely \"the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth\".\n\nDeath is studied at the [[Department of Mysteries]] in a chamber containing an enigmatic veil, which Rowling has described as \"the divide between life and death\". With regard to what is on the other side, she elaborated: \"Do I believe you go on? Yes, I do believe you go on. I do believe in an afterlife, although I'm absolutely doubt-ridden and always have been but there you are.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anelli|first1=Melissa|title=More About that Veil|url=http://www.harryahistory.com/2008/09/more-about-that-veil.html|website=Harry, A History|accessdate=8 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120023032/http://www.harryahistory.com/2008/09/more-about-that-veil.html|archivedate=20 November 2008}}</ref> Sirius falls through this veil in ''Order of the Phoenix'' after he is hit with a curse from Bellatrix.\n\n===Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration===\nThe '''Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration''' is a magical theory mentioned by Hermione and later repeated by Ron in the final book. She explains that food is one of these: witches or wizards can cook and prepare food using magic, and even multiply it, but not create it out of nothing. There are numerous examples in the series of food ''appearing'' to have been conjured from nothing, such as the sudden materialisation of ingredients in the pots of Molly Weasley's kitchen and when Professor McGonagall creates a self-refilling plate of sandwiches for Harry and Ron in ''[[Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]''. In all cases, these events can be reasonably explained as food either being multiplied or transported from elsewhere. One example of the latter is banqueting at Hogwarts\u2014the food is prepared by elves in the kitchens and laid onto four replica tables, directly below the actual house tables in the Great Hall. The food is then magically transported to the tables.\n\nThis is the only exception mentioned explicitly in the series. However, Rowling herself has stated once in an interview that ''money'' is something wizards cannot simply materialise out of thin air,<ref name=\"accio-quote.org\"/> or the economic system of the wizarding world would then be gravely flawed and disrupted. While the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] does permit [[alchemy]], this is portrayed as an extremely rare, even unique, object, whose owner does not exploit its powers.\n\n===Emotion===\nAs explained earlier, young untrained wizards can trigger uncontrolled magic when they are in the state of heightened emotions. But emotions also affect trained witches and wizards and their magical abilities. For instance, in ''Half-Blood Prince'', a heartbroken [[Nymphadora Tonks]] temporarily loses her power as a [[Metamorphmagus]] when [[Remus Lupin]] starts distancing himself from her. The form of her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] changes to reflect her depression. Another example is [[The House of Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], who only demonstrated any magical ability when removed from her father's oppression, but then lost it again when her husband abandoned her.\n\nSeveral magical spells require the use of certain emotions when casting them. The Patronus charm, for example, requires the caster to concentrate on a happy memory. (Force of will, under extenuating circumstances, helps a lot. An example of this is when Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus when Sirius is in danger of being administered the Dementor's Kiss.){{HP3}} Another example is the [[#Unforgivable Curses|Cruciatus Curse]], which causes immense pain; as Harry discovers during a duel with [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], effective use of this forbidden dark magic requires sadistic desires.{{HP5}}\n\nLove (in its broadest meaning) is depicted as a particularly powerful form of magic. According to Dumbledore, love is a \"force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces of nature.\"{{HP5}} Lily's voluntary sacrifice on Harry's behalf saves him from Voldemort as a baby, and Harry makes a similar sacrifice to save his friends at the end of ''Deathly Hallows''.{{HP7}} A certain key prophecy in the series describes Harry as having \"power the Dark Lord knows not\", referencing his capacity for love.{{HP5}}\n\nTrue love is impossible to create magically; [[Potions in Harry Potter#Amortentia|Amortentia]], a love potion, can only create a powerful sense of infatuation and obsession.\n\n==Magical abilities==\nThe following is a list of special abilities that a wizard or witch in the Harry Potter universe may have.\n\n=== <span id=\"Animagi_transformation\"></span> Animagi ===\nAn Animagus ([[portmanteau]] of animal and [[Magic (supernatural)|magus]]) is a witch or wizard who can turn into a particular animal or magical creature at will. This ability is not innate: it must be acquired by magical means. All Animagi must register at a central authority by law, though a number of characters are revealed over the course of the series to have remained unregistered illegally: [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#James Potter|James Potter]], [[Sirius Black]], [[Death_Eater#Peter_Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and [[Rita Skeeter]]. \n \nAnimagi transformation can be performed wandlessly. Sirius and Peter are left wandless for over 10 years, but both retain the ability with no apparent ill effects. When Animagi transform, they take on the appearance of a normal animal. However, in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', it is noted that Ron's pet rat Scabbers (later revealed as Peter Pettigrew's Animagus form) has lived over twelve years when only expected to live three. Also, an Animagus in animal form retains the ability to think like a human, which is the principal difference between being an animagus and being transfigured into an animal. Otherwise, they would forget that they were a wizard and be trapped, unknowingly, in this form unless transformed back by another wizard. Characteristics of an Animagus' human form can manifest themselves in the animal transformation; for example, the markings around McGonagall's eyes as a cat resemble her glasses. When an Animagus registers, they must record all the defining physical traits of their animal form so that the Ministry can identify them.\n\nEach Animagus has a specific animal form, and cannot transform into any other animal. The animal cannot be chosen: it is uniquely suited to that individual's personality, and in most cases the Animagus will change into the same animal used in the person's [[Patronus Charm]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Pottermore Presents: Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies|publisher=Pottermore|isbn=978-1-78110-628-0}}</ref>  \n\nExplicit emphasis is placed in the books on the differences between Animagi and [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolves]]. Animagi have full control over their transformations and retain their minds, whereas werewolves' transformations are involuntary and include severe changes in personality. After the person has transformed into a werewolf \"...he no longer remembers who he is.  He'd kill his best friend. The werewolf only responds to the call of his own kind.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date=2004 |title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  |medium=Motion Picture |language=English |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id=  |oclc= |quote=Hermione during Defence against the Dark Arts as Snape substitutes for Lupin. |ref= }}</ref> The only way that a werewolf can retain his sanity, intelligence and memory while transformed is using the Wolfsbane Potion.\n\n===Metamorphmagi===\nA '''Metamorphmagus''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[metamorph]]'' and ''[[magus]]'') is a witch or wizard born with the innate ability to change some or all of their appearance at will. The talent cannot be acquired; a witch or wizard who has it must be born with it.\n\n[[Nymphadora Tonks]] and her son, [[Teddy Lupin]] are currently the only known Metamorphmagi in the series; it is a very rare ability, possibly hereditary. Tonks is known to change her hair colour and style according to her mood. She even appears as an old woman on occasion. She can also change her nose appearance, as she does when eating with the Weasley family to entertain Ginny and Hermione. Her son, Teddy Lupin, also inherited this trait, as his hair is mentioned repeatedly changing colour.\n\nThe extent of these appearance-altering abilities and the limits thereof are not entirely clear. According to Rowling, a Metamorphmagus can alter his or her appearance completely, for instance, from black to white, young to old, handsome to plain and so on.<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926035344/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41 |archivedate=2011 |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41|title=J.K. Rowling's Official Site, rumour section}}</ref> In one example, Tonks changes her facial appearance by reshaping her nose into \"a beaklike protuberance like Snape's\", to \"something resembling a button mushroom\", and \"one like a pig snout\" which reminded Harry of his cousin Dudley.<ref>Rowling, J.K.: \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", page 85. Scholastic, 2003</ref> The emotional state of a Metamorphmagus can affect their abilities.\n\n===Parseltongue===\n'''Parseltongue''' is the language of snakes. It is often associated with Dark Magic, although Dumbledore stated that it is not necessarily an evil quality. Those possessing the ability to speak it (\"'''Parselmouths'''\") occur very rarely. People apparently acquire the skill through learning or via a method of [[xenoglossia]], such as through genetic inheritance (or by use of Dark or dangerous Magic). Harry was a Parselmouth until the age of 17. ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' explains this was because of Voldemort's passing on some of his abilities to Harry the night he tried to kill him. ''Deathly Hallows'' reveals that a part of Voldemort's soul within Harry grants him this ability, which is later destroyed leaving Harry stripped of the ability.<ref name=\"J.K.

The predictions given through this ability can sometimes be [[self-fulfilling prophecies]], and Dumbledore states in ''Order of the Phoenix'' that not all of them come true, depending on the choices made by those mentioned. This would seem to indicate that a Seer predicts possible or likely events, at least in some cases. \n\nIn the [[Hall of Prophecy]] at the [[Department of Mysteries]], thousands upon thousands of glass spheres are imbued with records of prophecies made by Seers. Only a person mentioned in a prophecy can safely retrieve it; anyone else who tries to do so will be driven insane.\n\nAccording to McGonagall, true Seers are extremely rare. [[Sybill Trelawney]] is the only Seer portrayed in the books, and is considered an \"old fraud\" by her students -- although it is mentioned that Sybill's great-great-grandmother, Cassandra Trelawney, was a renowned Seer in her day. Trelawney is ultimately sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in the fifth book for her lack of ability.  She has, however, twice made true prophecies -- both of significance to Harry Potter -- but had no recollection of either prediction afterward.\n\n===Legilimency and Occlumency===\n'''Legilimency''' is the magical skill of extracting feelings and memories from another person's mind\u2014a form of magical \"[[telepathy]]\" (although Snape, an able practitioner of the art, dismisses the colloquial term \"mind-reading\", as a drastic oversimplification). It also allows one to convey visions or memories to another person, whether real or imaginary. A witch or wizard possessing this skill is called a '''Legilimens,''' and can, for example, detect lies and deceit in another person, witness memories in another person's past, or \"plant\" false visions in another's mind.\n\nThe counter-skill to Legilimency is '''Occlumency''' (and its user, known as an '''Occlumens'''), by which one can compartmentalize one's emotions, or prevent a Legilimens from discovering thoughts or memories which contradict one's spoken words or actions. An advanced form of Occlumency is planting false temporary memories inside an Occlumens' own head while blocking all other true memories, so if a Legilimens, even a highly skilled one, were to attempt to read the mind, he or she would find false memories only and believe everything was right.\n\nThe skills are first mentioned in ''Order of the Phoenix''. Legilimency and Occlumency are not part of the normal curriculum at Hogwarts, and most students would graduate without learning them. \n\nVoldemort, [[Severus Snape|Snape]], and Dumbledore are all skilled in Legilimency and Occlumency, albeit with the use of their wands. Voldemort is said to be the master of Legilimency by Snape, as he, in almost all cases, immediately knows if someone lied to him. In addition, in ''Deathly Hallows'', Voldemort repeatedly uses Legilimency to interrogate his victims. Voldemort practices Occlumency throughout the period of ''Half-Blood Prince'' to deny Harry access to his thoughts and emotions. However, in ''Deathly Hallows'', Voldemort repeatedly loses grip, resulting in occasional but very powerful burst of thoughts, visions and emotions to be sent to Harry.\n\nThroughout the books, Snape is repeatedly said to be highly skilled in Occlumency,<ref>Prince, Alan (2011). ''The True Story of Severus Snape: An Essay About Harry Potter's Most Disputed Character'', p. 52.</ref> explaining how he was able to deceive Voldemort for years. Even before ''Order of the Phoenix'', Harry has the impression that Snape can read minds.\n\nDuring the ''Order of Phoenix'' Snape is instructed by Dumbledore to give Harry lessons in Occlumency. Due to the antagonism between the two, and Harry's secret desire to know Voldemort's thoughts, he makes poor progress, and only once manages to overcome Snape and enter his mind.<ref name=\"{{HP5}}ch26\">{{HP5}}, chapter 26</ref>  In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry finally masters Occlumency\u2014shutting his mind to Voldemort\u2014when Dobby dies. He realises that his grief\u2014or as Dumbledore calls it, love\u2014is what can block out the Dark Lord.\n\nQueenie Goldstein, in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', is revealed to be a proficient Legilimens, born with the ability, as she is able to read the minds of Jacob Kowalski and others in the film, as well as sense and hear them from afar through their thoughts and emotions. Unlike Snape, Voldemort and Dumbledore however, she does not require a wand to cast the spells of Legilimency as the ability to read minds comes naturally to her.\n\n===Apparition and Disapparition===\n<!--CHECK THE BOOKS; THE NOUN FORMS OF \"APPARATE\" AND \"DISAPPARATE\" ARE \"APPARITION\" AND \"DISAPPARITION\", NOT \"APPARATION\" AND \"DISAPPARATION\".  THIS WAS AN AESTHETIC DECISION MADE BY J.K. ROWLING, AS SHE HAS SAID BEFORE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TWO FORMS.  THEY APPEAR AS \"APPARATION\" AND \"DISAPPARATION\" EARLIER ON, BUT THESE FORMS ARE MADE OBSOLETE BY \"APPARITION\" AND \"DISAPPARITION\", WHICH APPEAR IN OoTP, HBP, AND DH, THE THREE MOST RECENT BOOKS\u2014Editorial note, Ron splinched himself twice in DH, not HBP, amending now -->\n'''Apparition''' is a magical form of [[teleportation]], through which a witch or wizard can disappear (\"'''Disapparate'''\") from one location and reappear (\"'''Apparate'''\") in another. It is sometimes accompanied by a distinctive cracking or popping sound, though the more skilled wizards such as Dumbledore can Apparate \"so suddenly and silently\" that they seem to have \"popped out of the ground\". According to Harry, apparition is also accompanied by a very unpleasant squeezing sensation, as though being sent through a tight rubber tube.{{HP6}}\n\nThe Ministry of Magic licenses Apparition. A witch or wizard must be 17 years old or older and have a licence to Apparate as a means of transportation in much the same way real-world governments require individuals to have a [[driver's license|licence to drive a motor vehicle]]. Students at Hogwarts may attend Ministry-administered Apparition lessons during their sixth year, and take their examination once they turn seventeen. It is shown that although it is possible to Apparate without a licence, it is not usually done (unless in lessons) and is illegal. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry does not possess a licence, but since his Trace has been lifted, the Ministry is likely unaware that he does it.\n\nLearning to Apparate is difficult, and students run the risk of ''splinching''\u2014being physically split between the origin and destination\u2014which requires the assistance of the Ministry's [[Accidental Magic Reversal Squad]] to undo properly, although essence of [[Origanum dictamnus | dittany]] can also mend certain wounds. Splinching is quite common during lessons, and can be uncomfortable (and at times rather gruesome) depending on the body parts splinched, but is ultimately harmless if properly reversed. Although Ron can Apparate, he isn't terribly skilled at it, and splinches himself at least three times (once losing half an eyebrow, two fingernails and part of his arm). Harry and Hermione both pick up the skill quickly in comparison. As explained in the ''Half-Blood Prince'', there is no word spell to Apparate or Disapparate, but the caster has to concentrate on the location on which he has to apparate, needs to be fully focused on the spell, and also has to \"feel\" it through the whole body.\n\nIt has been indicated that it is considered rude to Apparate directly into a private area, such as a home. Dumbledore states in ''Half-Blood Prince'' that it would be \"quite as rude as kicking down the front door\". For this reason, and for reasons of security, many homes have Anti-Apparition spells protecting them from uninvited intrusions. The accepted way to travel to a home is to Apparate to a nearby location and continue to the final destination on foot. Apparition is considered unreliable over long distances, and even experienced users of the technique sometimes prefer other means of transport, such as [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomstick]]s. Rowling has stated that Apparating over long distances depends on the skill of the wizard, and \"Cross-continental Apparition would almost certainly result in severe injury or death.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Welcome to my new website!|url=https://www.jkrowling.com/welcome-to-my-new-website/|website=jkrowling.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Indeed, even the prodigiously skilled [[Lord Voldemort]] elects to fly back to England after visiting the far-flung [[Nurmengard]].\n\nFor reasons of security, the grounds and buildings of Hogwarts are protected by ancient Anti-Apparition and Anti-Disapparition spells, which prevent humans from Apparating on the school grounds. There is also a spell that prevents individuals from Disapparating, which Dumbledore places on the Death Eaters captured at the Ministry in ''Order of the Phoenix''; a sister spell, which allows one to Apparate into a location but prevents them from Disapparating out of it, is cast by the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade in concordance with the Caterwauling Charm. Dumbledore is the only person who can both Apparate and Disapparate from the school grounds, since he is the headmaster.\n\nA witch or wizard can use ''Side-Along Apparition'' to take others with them during Apparition. Dumbledore successfully transports Harry this way several times in ''Half-Blood Prince'', and Harry's first non-lesson attempt at the skill is the Side-Along Apparition with the weakened Dumbledore when they return from the seaside cave. \n\nIn the ''Order of the Phoenix'' film, Death Eaters and Order members Apparate and Disapparate in clouds of black and white smoke respectively. In the film, both sides also appear to be able to \"half-apparate\" in which their bodies were made out of smoke, giving them the ability to fly. Both times Fred and George apparated and disapparated, they did it with a ''pop'' as in the books.\n\nIn the books, the words \"Apparate\" and \"Disapparate\", like many other [[neologism]]s used by Rowling, are [[Capitalization|capitalised]], whereas established English words such as \"jinx\" and \"hex\" are not. The words themselves are most likely derived from the French ''appara\u00eetre'' and ''dispara\u00eetre'', meaning 'to appear' and 'to disappear'. Another possible derivation is from the English word \"apparition\", meaning \"a supernatural appearance of a person or thing; anything that appears, especially something remarkable or startling; an act of appearing\", which comes from the Latin ''\"apparitio\"'', meaning attendance. \"Disapparate\" probably comes from the same word but with the prefix \"dis-\" expressing negation or reversal.\n\n===Other teleportation===\nSome magical creatures have their own forms of instantaneous travel, such as a house elf's ability to teleport or a phoenix's ability to appear and disappear in a burst of flame. Unlike wizards, these creatures are not restricted by anti-Apparition magic. [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]], [[Kreacher]] and the rest of the house-elf population can Apparate within the Hogwarts grounds, as they demonstrate on multiple occasions, most notably when Dobby visits Harry in the hospital wing, and when Harry summons Dobby and Kreacher and assigns them to tail Draco Malfoy. [[Fawkes]] disapparates from the headmaster's office at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore when the latter evades arrest at the hands of Ministry officials in ''Order of the Phoenix''. \n\nSome magical devices like the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Floo Powder |Floo Network]], [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Portkeys|Portkeys]] and [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Vanishing Cabinet |Vanishing Cabinets]] also provide forms of magical teleportation.\n\n===Veela charm===\nAn ability attributed to [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#veela| Veela]] and those of Veela heritage, such as [[Fleur Delacour]], Veela charm is used to charm males, much as the [[Siren (mythology) |Siren]]s do in ''[[The Odyssey]]''. Men who are exposed to it over time become more resistant to it, although the Veela charm takes full effect if the Veela surprises the man, as noted by Ron in ''Half-Blood Prince''.\n\nAs shown in ''Goblet of Fire'', one can use Veela hair as cores in magical wands. According to famed wandmaker Mr. Ollivander, these wands are a little \"temperamental\".\n\n===Magical resistance===\nThis refers to a certain degree of immunity against hexes and spells found in powerful creatures such as [[trolls]], [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Dragons|dragons]], and [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Giants|giants]]. Hagrid is resistant to certain spells, like the Stunning Spell, due to his giant blood. This type of resistance is not insurmountable; if enough Stunning Spells, for example, are fired at a creature with magical resistance at once, the creature may still be rendered unconscious. Also, wizards and witches can resist certain spells with the power of their own sheer will, such as Harry did in ''Goblet of Fire'', when [[Barty Crouch Jr.]] disguised as Alastor Moody tried to control Harry with the Imperius curse and Harry resisted.\n\n==Subjects at Hogwarts==\nAt Hogwarts, students must study a core group of subjects for the first two years, after which they must choose between several electives. During their final two years, students are permitted to take more specialized subjects such as Alchemy.\n\nTransfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology are compulsory subjects for the first five years, as well as flying lessons. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Very specialised subjects such as [[Alchemy]] are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand. There is a total of twelve named [[Hogwarts staff|Professors]] at Hogwarts, each specializing in one of these subjects.\n\n===Transfiguration===\n'''Transfiguration''' is essentially the art of changing the properties of an object.<ref name=\"TransCharms\">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1998/1298-herald-simpson.html 1998: Accio Quote!, the Largest Archive of J.K. Rowling quotes on the web<!-- Bot generated title -->], quick-quote.quill.org</ref> Transfiguration is a theory-based subject, including topics such as \"Switching Spells\" (altering only a part of some object, such as when Hagrid gave Dudley a pig tail); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely disappear);{{OotP|ch=13}} and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air).{{OotP|ch=13}} It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa \u2013 Minerva McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigures her desk into a [[domestic pig|pig]] and back in ''Philosopher's Stone''.{{PStone |ch=8}}\n\n===Defence Against the Dark Arts===\n<!--DO NOT change this to \"DEFENSE\" with an S. As per [[MOS:HPP#ENGLISH]], we use British spelling in Harry Potter-related articles. Thank you.-->\n'''Defence Against the Dark Arts''', commonly shortened to '''D.A.D.A.''',<ref>{{HPref|book=6|chapter=12}}</ref> is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the [[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|Dark Arts]], and to be protected from Dark creatures. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', with Death-Eaters in charge of the school, the subject is renamed the '''Dark Arts''', and involves pupils practicing the [[#Unforgivable Curses|Cruciatus Curse]] on those who have earned detentions.{{DH|ch=29}} The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members\u2014throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject.  During the period the story takes place, the class is taught by [[Quirinus Quirrell]] ([[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|book one]]), [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] ([[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|book two]]), [[Remus Lupin]] ([[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|book three]]), [[Bartemius Crouch Jr]] impersonating [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-eye\" Moody]] ([[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|book four]]), [[Dolores Umbridge]] ([[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|book five]]), [[Severus Snape]] ([[Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince|book six]]), and [[Amycus Carrow]] ([[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|book seven]]). Hagrid suggests in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' that ''\"They're startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now.\"'' In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected.{{HBP|ch=20}} The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in ''Half-Blood Prince''. Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of ''Deathly Hallows'' and the [[epilogue]], set nineteen years afterwards. Furthermore, she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jen |last=Brown |title=Stop your sobbing!

Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic spell concerned with giving an object ''new'' and unexpected properties.<ref name=\"TransCharms\"/> Charms classes are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical.{{OotP|ch=18}} Many of the [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, which are on the second floor of Hogwarts. The class is taught by [[Filius Flitwick]].\n\n===Potions===\n{{Further|Potions in Harry Potter}}\n'''Potions''' is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures. As to the question of whether a Muggle could brew a potion, given the correct magical ingredients, Rowling has said, \"Potions seems, on the face of it, to be the most Muggle-friendly subject. But there does come a point in which you need to do more than stir.\"<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0801-radiocityreading1.html 2006: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web<!-- Bot generated title -->], quick-quote.quill.org</ref> Rowling later confirmed on [[Pottermore]] that \"There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Potions|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/potions|website=[[Pottermore]]|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Snape's lessons are depicted as unhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst Slughorn's, who replaces Snape as Potions Master, are shown as more cheerful and even fun at times.\n\n===Astronomy===\n'''Astronomy''' classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observations of the night skies with [[telescope]]s. No astronomy lessons are shown in the books, but they are frequently referenced. Rowling describes one of Harry's Astronomy exams in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Also, bits of the Astronomy Tower are seen throughout the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film series]], such as HP2 and HP3, and featured in ''[[Half-Blood Prince]]'', as the place where Dumbledore died, and seen in ''[[Deathly Hallows]]''. Known student homework activities include learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements, and environments.\n\n===History of Magic===\n'''History of Magic''' is the study of magical history. [[Cuthbert Binns]]' lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin rebellions, giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only class at Hogwarts that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed.\n\n===Herbology===\n'''Herbology''' is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise and combat them. There are at least three greenhouses described in the books, holding a variety of magical plants. Herbology is also the only subject Neville excels in. The epilogue to ''Deathly Hallows'' explains that he later replaces Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher.\n\n===Arithmancy===\n'''Arithmancy''' is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. As Harry Potter does not take this subject, the class is never described in the books. It is, however, a favourite subject of Hermione. Arithmancy is reportedly difficult, as it requires memorising or working with many charts. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', it is mentioned that the study of Arithmancy is required to become a Curse-Breaker for [[Gringotts]]. The subject is taught by Professor Septima Vector.\n\n===Study of Ancient Runes===\n'''Study of Ancient Runes''', more commonly known as '''Ancient Runes''', is a generally theoretical subject that studies the ancient runic scripts. Because only [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] studies it, little else is known about this subject, taught by Professor Bathsheda Babbling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Vander Ark |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-jottings1.html |title=HP-lexicon.org |publisher=HP-lexicon.org |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> In ''Deathly Hallows'' Dumbledore bequeaths his copy of ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'', which is written in ancient runes, to [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]].\n\n===Divination===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sybill Trelawney]] -->\n'''[[Divination]]''' is the art of predicting the future. Various methods are described, including [[Tasseography|tea leaves]], [[Divination|fire omens]], [[crystal ball]]s, [[palmistry]], [[cartomancy]] (including the reading of conventional [[playing cards]] and the [[tarot]]), [[astrology]], and [[dream interpretation]]s. Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as \"one of the most imprecise branches of magic\".{{PA|ch=6}} Supporters of the subject claim that it is an inexact science that requires innate gifts such as the \"Inner Eye\". Those opposed claim that the subject is irrelevant and fraudulent. Harry is first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by Firenze after Trelawney is sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in Harry's fifth year. In the sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney share Divination classes, divided by year.\n\n===Care of Magical Creatures===\n'''Care of Magical Creatures''' is the class which instructs students on how to care for [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical beasts]]. Classes are held outside the castle. In Harry's first two years, the class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then retires \"in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs\". Dumbledore then recruits the gamekeeper [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties. Although Hagrid is obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he doesn't \"have a normal person's view of what's dangerous\", an example being that the Care of Magical Creatures students were required to get a literally ferocious textbook called the \"Monster Book of Monsters\", and so consistently misjudges the risk that the animals he uses in his lessons pose to his students{{PA |ch=6}}{{GF |ch=13}}, which sometimes results in chaos. When Hagrid is absent, his lessons are taken over by Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, a witch and an acquaintance of Dumbledore's.\n\n===Muggle Studies===\n'''Muggle Studies''' is a class that involves the study of the [[muggle]] (non-magical) culture \"from a wizarding point of view.\" The only need for witches and wizards to learn about muggle [[culture|ways]] and [[technology|means]] is to ensure they can blend in with muggles while needing to do so (for example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). As the class is only mentioned as being taken by [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and for just one year, little is known about its curriculum.\nIn the opening chapter of the final book, Voldemort murders Professor [[Charity Burbage]] because she portrays muggles in a positive light and is opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of pure-blood origins. For the rest of the academic year covered by ''Deathly Hallows'', the Death Eater [[Alecto Carrow]] teaches Muggle Studies. However, her lessons (which are made compulsory) mainly describe muggles and muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.\n\n===Alchemy===\n'''Alchemy''' classes are not mentioned in the ''Harry Potter'' series; however, Rowling has used Alchemy as an example of a 'specialized' subject offered when there is sufficient demand. Alchemy is a philosophical tradition searching for the [[philosopher's stone]], which is said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and to contain the [[elixir of life]], which makes or keeps the drinker young and immortal. As mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Nicholas Flamel created a Philosopher's Stone, but it was destroyed at the end of Harry's first year.\n\n===Flying===\n'''Flying''' is the class that teaches the use of [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomsticks]] made for the use of flying and is taught only to Hogwarts first years by [[Rolanda Hooch]]. The subject is the only one that requires physicality. The only flying lesson depicted in the Harry Potter series is in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''; the class is never mentioned in following installments; and is not a part of the O.W.L. exams during Harry's fifth year.\n\n===Apparition===\n'''Apparition''' is an optional class for those in the sixth and seventh years at Hogwarts, in preparation for obtaining their license. In Harry's sixth year, [[Wilkie Twycross]], a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor, teaches the lessons. Magical enchantments on Hogwarts castle and grounds prevent Apparition and Disapparition inside the castle; however ''Half-Blood Prince'' explains that these protections are temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practice. Students are warned, though, that they will not be able to Apparate outside of the Great Hall and that it would be unwise to try. Splinching is a common mistake in apparition which causes body parts to split. It is impossible to track anyone by apparition unless the person grabs the apparator\u2019s clothing or body.\n\n==Spell-like effects==\n\n===Unbreakable Vow===\nThe '''Unbreakable Vow''' is a voluntary agreement made between two witches or wizards. It must be performed with a witness (\"Bonder\") on hand, holding their wand on the agreeing persons' linked hands to bind them with magic as a tongue of flame. The Vow is not literally \"unbreakable\" as the person taking it is still able to go back on his or her word, but doing so will cause instant death. The Unbreakable Vow was first introduced in ''Half-Blood Prince'', in which Snape made a promise to Narcissa Malfoy to protect Draco, with Bellatrix as the \"Bonder\", as her son attempted to fulfil the Dark Lord's task, and for Snape to fulfil the task if Draco fails. Another example in ''Half-Blood Prince'' occurs when Ron tells Harry how Fred and George tried to make him undertake an Unbreakable Vow, but because of their father's intervention, they did not succeed.\n\n===Priori Incantatem===\n'''Priori Incantatem''' (from Latin: ''priorem incantatum'' - '''a previous spell'''), or the '''Reverse Spell Effect''', is used to detect the spells cast by a wand. The spells cast by the wand will emerge in smoky or ghost-like replicas in reverse order, with the latest spell emerging first. It is first encountered in ''Goblet of Fire'' when the house elf Winky is found holding Harry's wand. This spell is used to reveal that it was indeed Harry's wand that cast the Dark Mark. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince]]'', it is revealed that the teenage Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents using his uncle Morfin's wand, knowing that, when examined, the wand would incriminate Morfin as the murderer. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry fears that a ''Priori Incantatem'' spell will be used on Hermione's wand after the [[Death Eaters]] get hold of it. This would reveal that she had accidentally broken his holly-and-phoenix-feather wand when a curse misfired and they both narrowly escaped Voldemort earlier. As a result, the protection of the shared cores was lost and, worse still, this would now be made known to Voldemort. During the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, the latter mentions that he knows that the holly and phoenix wand is destroyed, implying that the Priori Incantatem has indeed been performed on Hermione's wand, as they had feared.\n\nForcing two wands that share the source of their cores to do battle can also cause a more potent form of Priori Incantatem. The tips of the two wands will connect, forming a thick golden \"thread\" of energy, and the two wands' masters fight a battle of wills. The loser's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter|wand]] will regurgitate shadows of spells that it has cast in reverse order. This phenomenon occurs during the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of ''Goblet of Fire''. Their simultaneous spells (Harry and Voldemort cast \"Expelliarmus\" and \"Avada Kedavra\" respectively) trigger the threads, and as Voldemort loses the battle of wills, his wand regurgitates, in reverse order, echoes of the people his wand had last murdered: [[Cedric Diggory]]; [[Frank Bryce]]; [[Bertha Jorkins]]; as well as Harry's parents. Harry was previously informed by [[Mr. Ollivander]] that the holly wand that \"chose\" Harry was the \"brother\" of the yew wand that gave him the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, although the significance of this was not discussed then. Dumbledore later reveals to Harry that his and Voldemort's wands both contain a tail feather given by Dumbledore's pet [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]].\n\n==Dark Arts==\nThe '''Dark Arts''' are magical spells and practices that are usually used for malicious purposes. Practitioners of Dark Arts are referred to as Dark witches or wizards. The most prominent of these is Voldemort, known to them as the Dark Lord. His followers, known as [[Death Eater]]s, practice the Dark Arts while doing his bidding.\n\nThe type of spells characteristic of Dark Arts are known as curses,<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24 J.K. Rowling's Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124192524/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24 |date=24 January 2008 }}</ref> which usually cause harm to the target. All, to a certain degree, are in some circumstances justifiable. The motivation of the caster affects a curse's result. This is most notable in the case of ''Cruciatus'': when cast by Harry, angered by the death of his godfather at Bellatrix's hands AND desiring to punish her, it causes a short moment of pain. As Bellatrix herself comments, righteous anger does not allow the spell to work for long. When cast by figures such as Voldemort, who desire to inflict pain for its own sake, it causes intense agony that can last as long as the Dark witch or wizard desires. Use of Dark Magic can corrupt the soul and body; Voldemort has used such magic in his quest to prolong his life and obtain great power. The Dark Arts also cause Voldemort to look deformed and inhuman, a side effect of splitting his soul into Horcruxes.\n\nAccording to Snape, the Dark Arts \"are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal... unfixed, mutating, indestructible\".<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch9\">{{HP6}}, chapter 9</ref> In magical dueling, there are any number of spells that may be used to attack, immobilise, or disarm an opponent without causing pain or lasting harm; however, spells such as the Cruciatus Curse or Sectumsempra, judged to be Dark by reliable authorities, wound or seriously distress a victim in some way. Dark spells can be classified into three groups: jinxes, hexes & curses.\n\nIn the wizarding world, use of the Dark Arts is strongly stigmatised and some aspects are illegal; however, these spells are prevalent enough that even before the rise of Voldemort, many schools (including Hogwarts) taught [[Subjects at Hogwarts#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] as a standard subject. Techniques include anti-curses and simple spells to disable or disarm attackers or fight off certain creatures. Some schools, such as [[Durmstrang]], teach Dark Magic. A Dark Arts class is also taught at Hogwarts while it is under Death Eater control.\n\n===Unforgivable Curses===\nThe '''Unforgivable Curses''' are some of the most powerful known Dark Arts spells. They were first classified as unforgivable in 1717. Used by the books' villains, such as Voldemort and the [[Death Eater]]s and in some cases the Ministry of Magic, their use inspires horror and great fear amongst others. The curses are so named because their use is forbidden and unforgivable in the wizarding world and is punishable by a life sentence in [[Azkaban]]. The only exception is if a person is proved to have done them under the influence of mind control. These curses are thus very rarely used openly.\n\n*The '''Killing Curse''' (incantation: ''Avada Kedavra'') manifests as a jet of green light that causes immediate, painless death. The Killing Curse has no counter-curse and cannot be blocked by most magical means. It can be blocked by love. However, the green energy bolt may be dodged, blocked with solid objects or intercepted with a few other powerful fast spells, particularly Stunning spells.  [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is the only person known to have survived (twice), nullified (once) and deflected (once) this curse.\n*The '''Cruciatus Curse''' (incantation: ''Crucio'', Latin for \"I torture\") causes the victim intense pain and is used for [[torture]], but does not physically harm them. The strength of the curse is determined by the person who cast it. It was used regularly by the Death Eaters. The curse can  torture a person to the point that they are exhausted to death, or in a more sadistic case, it causes permanent amnesia and insanity. Effective casting requires the caster to have sadistic desires. It is shown as a bright-faded blue light (though it is usually invisible or even a red bolt of light in the films).\n*The '''Imperius Curse''' (incantation: ''Imperio'', faux Latin for \"I command\", cf. [[imperialism]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) is used for [[mind control]] or [[hypnosis]] and can force the victim to do things they would normally be unwilling or unable to. The strength and duration of the curse depends on the caster, as well as the level of resistance of the victim. The curse is shown as a bright haze (while it was either invisible or green, mist-like haze in the films). \n\nThe use of the Unforgivable Curses was authorised against Voldemort and his followers by [[Ministry of Magic#Barty Crouch, Sr|Bartemius Crouch Sr]], during the First Wizarding War. (Shortly after his resurrection, Voldemort names two Death Eaters \"killed by [[Ministry of Magic#Auror Office|Auror]]s\".) In addition, in ''Deathly Hallows'', the Unforgivable Curses are used liberally by good characters, ranging from [[Professor McGonagall]] with the Imperius Curse, to Harry effectively using the Cruciatus Curse. He also uses the Imperius Curse on a goblin and a suspicious Death Eater during their disguised attack upon Gringotts Bank.\n\n=== Dark Mark ===\nThe '''Dark Mark''' is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters and takes the form of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth in place of a tongue. The mark is cast into the sky by [[Death Eater]]s whenever they have murdered someone. ''Morsmordre'' is the spell to conjure the Mark. It first appears in ''Goblet of Fire'' and is described as a \"colossal skull, composed of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue\". Once in the sky it was \"blazing in a haze of greenish smoke\". Dark Marks are also branded on the left forearm of the closest followers of Voldemort. The mark serves as a connection between Voldemort and each who bears it; he can summon them by touching his mark, causing it and those of his followers to burn and change colour. Death Eaters can summon Voldemort in the same fashion. Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the Dark Marks on his Death Eaters fade into a scar \"similar\" to Harry's.<ref name=\"J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript\"/> In the books, the Dark Mark is described as green; however, in the films, it was only green at the Quidditch World Cup. In all other film appearances it has been grey.\n\n===Inferius===\n{{Distinguish|Infernus (disambiguation){{!}}Infernus}}\nAn '''Inferius''' (plural: '''Inferi''') is a [[Dead body|corpse]] controlled through a Dark wizard's spells. An Inferius is not alive, but a dead body that has been bewitched into acting like a puppet for the [[witch]] or wizard; this manifests itself as a white mist in the controlled corpse's eyes. They cannot think for themselves: they are created to perform a specific duty assigned by the Dark wizard who commands them, and as seen in the Inferi guarding Voldemort's Horcrux in a seaside cave, remain idle until their task can be performed. This task is then thoughtlessly carried out, whether or not it will produce any result. Inferi are difficult to harm by magic; however, they can be repelled by fire or any other forms of heat or light, as the Inferi in Voldemort's cave had never been exposed to either of these elements. When defeated, they return to their idle state.\n\nInferi are considered dangerous and frightening enough by the magical world that impersonating an Inferius (as [[Mundungus Fletcher]] is reported to have done in ''Half-Blood Prince'') is an offence worthy of imprisonment in [[Azkaban]].\n\nThe Ministry of Magic fears that Voldemort is killing enough people to make an army of Inferi: as they are dead, they are very difficult to stop. When Voldemort was hiding one of his [[Horcruxes]] in the past, he filled a lake in a cave with many Inferi, which were to attack and drown anyone but Voldemort who came into the cavern and took the locket. When Harry and Dumbledore took the locket, the Inferi attacked Harry; Dumbledore repelled them with a rope of fire. It is also revealed that the Inferi almost killed Kreacher after he drank from the basin to help Voldemort hide his Horcruxes, but having been ordered to return to his master after his task with Voldemort was complete, he was able to apparate out of the cave. These Inferi later killed Regulus Black when he stole the Horcrux and ordered Kreacher to destroy it.\n\nIn Latin, the word ''inferus'' (plural: ''inferi'') means \"below\", often referring in the plural to \"the gods below\" (see ''[[di inferi]])'' or the spirits of the dead.<ref name=\"lexicon\">{{cite book| last=Lewis | first=Charlton T. | last2=Short | first2=Charles | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1879 | place=Oxford | chapter=q.v., inferus, as positive noun I.B, as comparative adjective II.A | chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dinferus }}</ref> ''Inferius'' is a neuter singular form of ''inferior'', a [[comparative adjective]] meaning \"lower\".<ref name=\"lexicon\"/><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=inferius&la=la Morphology of inferius by The Perseus Project]</ref>\n\n===Horcrux===\n{{See also|Magical objects in Harry Potter#Horcruxes}}\nA '''horcrux''' is an object created using dark magic to attain effective immortality. The concept is first introduced in the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', although horcruxes are present in earlier novels without being described or expanded upon.\n\nTo create a horcrux, a witch or wizard must first prepare the chosen object<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html|title=\"PotterCast Interviews J.K. Rowling, part one.\" (2007), Accio Quote!|website=www.accio-quote.org|access-date=2017-12-31}}</ref> in a ritual which is referred to only as \u201ctoo horrible to go into detail about\u201d. Following the preparation of the object, the witch or wizard must then take a life, an act which splits the soul. Following that, further dark rituals are required in order to remove the soul shard from the maker and place it into the prepared object. Once this is done, the Horcrux becomes impervious to almost all forms of destruction, requiring extremely powerful magic or substances to do so.\n\nOrdinarily, when one's body is killed, the soul departs for the next world. If, however, the body of a horcrux owner is killed, that portion of his soul which had remained in his body will not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard. If all of someone's horcruxes are destroyed, then his soul's only anchor in the material world would be his body, the destruction of which would then cause his final death. To destroy the horcrux, the destroyer must destroy it in such a way that it is put beyond magical repair. In the seventh book, Gryffindor\u2019s sword, Basilisk fang and Fiendfyre are the substances used to destroy them.\n\n==Portraits==\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' series the subjects of '''magical portraits''' (even those of characters that are dead) can move, interact with living observers, speak and demonstrate apparent emotion and personality. Some can even move to other portraits to visit each other, or relay messages, or (if more than one painting of the subject exists) move between separate locations by way of their portraits. An example of this is Phineas Nigellus Black, who has a painting in the Headmaster's office and at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Many such portraits are found on the walls of Hogwarts. \n\nSome portraits are used to conceal the entrance of a room or passageway. For example, the Fat Lady's portrait covers the entrance to the [[Hogwarts#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]] common room, and she can swing the portrait open when given the correct password or close to prevent entry. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', there is a portrait of Ariana Dumbledore in the [[Room of Requirement]] that conceals a secret passageway to the Hog's Head. There is also a painting of a large fruit bowl in front of the Hogwarts kitchen, which will swing open if the pear is tickled to reveal a hidden door.\n\nPortraits are enchanted to move by the artist, but the degree to which they can interact with others depends on the power of the subject.<ref name=\"portraits\">{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Hogwarts Portraits|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-portraits|website=Pottermore|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> Rowling has commented that a portrait is merely a faint imprint of the deceased subject, imitating their basic personality and thought patterns. They are therefore \"not as fully realised as ghosts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=JK Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J. K.

They advise the Headmaster and are \"honour-bound to give service to the present headmaster\" (according to Armando Dippet). Rowling has explained that portraits of past headteachers tend to be more realistic than most, as the subject in question usually imparts knowledge and teaches them how to behave before their death.  The portrait of Snape was installed in the Headmaster's Office at Harry's request.<ref name=\"portraits\"/>\n\n===The Fat Lady===\nThe portrait of '''the Fat Lady''' covers the door to [[Gryffindor]] Tower. She will open it (sometimes grudgingly) when the correct password is uttered. She is often upset after being awoken, and is sometimes seen drunk with her best friend, Violet. The Fat Lady has no other known name \u2013 even the unfailingly polite Albus Dumbledore refers to her only as \"the Fat Lady\" \u2013 and it may be that she does not represent a real person but is instead an invention of her portrait's artist. In ''Philosopher's Stone'', she leaves her portrait in the middle of the night, locking Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville out of Gryffindor Tower, forcing them to run across the school. Luckily for them, when they return, she has returned to her portrait, allowing them to escape into Gryffindor Tower. In ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', Sirius Black slashes the Fat Lady's portrait when she won't let him in without a password and it is some time before she dares to guard Gryffindor Tower again. After her portrait is restored, she requests protection in case someone tries to attack her portrait again. Thus, two security trolls are hired. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', she gets so annoyed with Harry's late return that she pretends the password has changed and tries to call him back when he heads off to talk to Dumbledore. When Harry later confirms Dumbledore's death, she lets out a sob and, for the only time in the series, she opens without the password for Harry in her grief.\n\nIn the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|first film]] the Fat Lady is played by [[Elizabeth Spriggs]], and by [[Dawn French]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]].\n\n===Photographs===\nWizarding photographs of people have similar properties to magical painted portraits: the figures within move about or even sometimes leave the frame. They appear in wizard newspapers and other print media, as well as on [[Harry Potter universe#Magical sweets|Chocolate Frog]] cards.{{HP1}} [[Colin Creevey]] mentions in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that a boy in his dormitory said that if he develops the film from his Muggle camera 'in the right potion', the pictures will move.<ref name=\"{{HP2}}ch6\">{{HP2}}, chapter 6</ref> However, unlike portraits, figures in wizarding pictures cannot speak and display little sentience. It appears that they do have some knowledge of current events, as in ''Order of the Phoenix'', the family photograph on Arthur's desk shows everyone except Percy \"who appeared to have walked out of it\".<ref name=\"{{HP5}}ch7\">{{HP5}}, chapter 7</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|author=Highfield, Roger|year=2002|title=The Science of Harry Potter: How magic really works|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-03153-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/scienceofharrypo00high}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Teare, Elizabeth|year=2002|chapter=Harry Potter and the technology of magic|editor=Whited, Lana A.|title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a literary phenomenon|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, Missouri|pages=29\u2013342|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9}}\n* {{Cite journal|author=Black, Sharon|year=2003|title=The Magic of Harry Potter: Symbols and Heroes of Fantasy|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=34|issue=3|pages=237\u2013247|doi=10.1023/A:1025314919836}}\n\n==External links==\n{{hpw|Magic}}\n\n{{Harry Potter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magic in Harry Potter}}\n[[Category:Harry Potter universe]]\n[[Category:Fiction about magic]]\n\n[[fr:Univers de Harry Potter#Magie]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magic in ''Harry Potter''}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn [[J.

While Muggle-borns are quite common, Squibs are extremely rare.\n\nRowling based many magical elements of the ''Harry Potter'' universe on real-world mythology and magic. She has described this as \"a way of giving texture to the world\".<ref>{{cite episode|series=Harry Potter: A History of Magic|network=BBC|date=28 October 2017}}</ref> The books present the idea that the Muggle interpretation of these stories is a distorted version of what goes on in the wizarding world. \n\nThe magic of ''Harry Potter'' became the subject of a 2017 [[British Library]] exhibition and accompanying documentary.

While this reaction is usually uncontrollable, as an untrained child, [[Lord Voldemort]] was able to make things move without touching them, make animals do what he wanted without training them, make \"bad things happen to people\" who annoyed him, or make them hurt if he wanted to.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch13\">{{HP6}}, chapter 13</ref> In addition, [[Lily Potter]] was able to guide and control the blooming of a flower by wanting to.\n\nAlmost all magic is done with the use of a  [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]]. On the subject of wandless magic, Rowling says:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |title=2001: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K Rowling interviews on the web |accessdate=27 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827220619/http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |archivedate=27 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{cquote|You can do unfocused and uncontrolled magic without a wand (for instance when Harry blows up Aunt Marge) but to do really good spells, yes, you need a wand.}} \nA wizard or witch is only at their best when using their own wand. When using another's wand, one's spells are not as strong as they normally would be.{{HP1}}\n\nWithin the books, technical details of magic are obscure. Of Harry's lessons, only those involving [[magical beasts (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]], [[Potions in Harry Potter|potions]] or divination are given in any detail.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] once told [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] that \"Time and space matter in magic\" during Harry's first Occlumency lesson in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] told Harry after finding the magically concealed boat to reach the locket [[Horcrux]] that \"Magic always leaves traces, sometimes very distinctive traces.\"{{HP6}}\n\n=== Spellcasting ===\n[[Spell (paranormal)|Spells]] are the every-purpose tools of a wizard or witch; short bursts of magic used to accomplish single specialised tasks such as opening locks or creating fire. Typically casting requires an [[incantation]], most often in a modified form of [[Latin]] (see [[Dog Latin]]), and gesturing with a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]]. However, Rowling has revealed that particularly talented wizards can cast spells without the aid of wand, although magic produced with one is generally more precise and powerful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en|title=History of Magic in North America|website=[[Pottermore]]|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Spells can also be cast non-verbally, but with a magical wand. This special technique is taught in the sixth year of study at Hogwarts and requires the caster to concentrate on the incantation. Some spells (e.g. ''Levicorpus'') are apparently designed to be used non-verbally. While most magic shown in the books requires the caster to use their voice, some do not (and this may depend on the witch or wizard). Dumbledore has been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking, such as [[conjuring]] enough squashy purple sleeping bags to accommodate the entire student population{{HP3}} or during his duel with Voldemort towards the end of ''Order of the Phoenix''.\n\nIt is possible to use a wand without holding it. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', Harry himself performs ''Lumos'' to light his wand when it is lying on the ground somewhere near him.{{HP5}} Additionally, [[Animagus|Animagi]] and [[Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagi]] do not need wands to undergo their transformations.\n\nSpells are divided into rough categories, such as \"[[Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|charm]]s\", \"[[curse]]s\", \"hexes\", or \"[[jinx]]es\". Although offensive and potentially dangerous curses exist in number, three are considered usable only for great evil, which earns them the special classification of \"[[#Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]\".\n\n== The limits of magic ==\nBefore publishing the first ''Harry Potter'' novel, Rowling spent five years establishing the limitations of magic\u2014determining what it could and could not do. \"The most important thing to decide when you're creating a fantasy world,\" she said in 2000, \"is what the characters ''can't'' do.\" For instance, while it is possible to conjure things out of thin air, it is far more tricky to create something that fits an exact specification rather than a general one; moreover, any objects so conjured tend not to last.<ref name=\"accio-quote.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/therules.htm |title= JKR quotes about \"the rules\" of Harry Potter's Wizarding World: |accessdate=27 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nRowling has described death as the most important theme in the books.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Harry Potter and Me|network=BBC|date=28 December 2001|transcript=Accio Quote|transcript-url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm}}</ref> Consequently, as Dumbledore states in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', there is no spell that can truly bring the dead back to life. While corpses can be transformed into obedient [[#Inferius|Inferi]] on a living wizard's command, they are little more than [[zombies]] with no soul or will of their own. However, there are some methods of communicating with the dead, though with limited results. For example, all Hogwarts headmasters appear in a [[Magical portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] when they die, allowing consultation by future generations. It is also possible through the rare [[#Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect to converse with ghost-like \"shadows\" of magically murdered people. The [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Resurrection Stone|Resurrection Stone]] also allows one to talk to the dead, but those brought back by the Stone are not corporeal, nor do they wish to be disturbed from their peaceful rest. Throughout the series, this limit is continually mentioned, and wizards try to transcend it at their own peril.\n\nLikewise, it is not possible to make oneself immortal unless one makes use of an object of great power to sustain life, such as the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] or [[Horcrux]]es. If one were to possess the three [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]], it is fabled that they would possess the tools to become the \"master of death\". However, it is hinted that to be a true \"master of death\" is to be willing to accept that death is inevitable. Other methods of extending life include drinking unicorn blood, which will keep a person alive even if death is imminent, but at the terrible price of being cursed forever. Being magical can contribute to one's [[longevity]], as there are several characters in the series who are unusually long-lived (such as [[Griselda Marchbanks]], who was an [[Exam invigilator|invigilator]] during Albus Dumbledore's O.W.L examinations). It is revealed by [[Nearly Headless Nick]] in the fifth book that all witches and wizards have the choice of becoming [[Ghosts (Harry Potter)|ghosts]] upon dying; however, it is described as \"a pale imitation of life\". Snape states that a ghost is merely \"the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth\".\n\nDeath is studied at the [[Department of Mysteries]] in a chamber containing an enigmatic veil, which Rowling has described as \"the divide between life and death\". With regard to what is on the other side, she elaborated: \"Do I believe you go on? Yes, I do believe you go on. I do believe in an afterlife, although I'm absolutely doubt-ridden and always have been but there you are.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anelli|first1=Melissa|title=More About that Veil|url=http://www.harryahistory.com/2008/09/more-about-that-veil.html|website=Harry, A History|accessdate=8 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120023032/http://www.harryahistory.com/2008/09/more-about-that-veil.html|archivedate=20 November 2008}}</ref> Sirius falls through this veil in ''Order of the Phoenix'' after he is hit with a curse from Bellatrix.\n\n===Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration===\nThe '''Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration''' is a magical theory mentioned by Hermione and later repeated by Ron in the final book. She explains that food is one of these: witches or wizards can cook and prepare food using magic, and even multiply it, but not create it out of nothing. There are numerous examples in the series of food ''appearing'' to have been conjured from nothing, such as the sudden materialisation of ingredients in the pots of Molly Weasley's kitchen and when Professor McGonagall creates a self-refilling plate of sandwiches for Harry and Ron in ''[[Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]''. In all cases, these events can be reasonably explained as food either being multiplied or transported from elsewhere. One example of the latter is banqueting at Hogwarts\u2014the food is prepared by elves in the kitchens and laid onto four replica tables, directly below the actual house tables in the Great Hall. The food is then magically transported to the tables.\n\nThis is the only exception mentioned explicitly in the series. However, Rowling herself has stated once in an interview that ''money'' is something wizards cannot simply materialise out of thin air,<ref name=\"accio-quote.org\"/> or the economic system of the wizarding world would then be gravely flawed and disrupted. While the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] does permit [[alchemy]], this is portrayed as an extremely rare, even unique, object, whose owner does not exploit its powers.\n\n===Emotion===\nAs explained earlier, young untrained wizards can trigger uncontrolled magic when they are in the state of heightened emotions. But emotions also affect trained witches and wizards and their magical abilities. For instance, in ''Half-Blood Prince'', a heartbroken [[Nymphadora Tonks]] temporarily loses her power as a [[Metamorphmagus]] when [[Remus Lupin]] starts distancing himself from her. The form of her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] changes to reflect her depression. Another example is [[The House of Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], who only demonstrated any magical ability when removed from her father's oppression, but then lost it again when her husband abandoned her.\n\nSeveral magical spells require the use of certain emotions when casting them. The Patronus charm, for example, requires the caster to concentrate on a happy memory. (Force of will, under extenuating circumstances, helps a lot. An example of this is when Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus when Sirius is in danger of being administered the Dementor's Kiss.){{HP3}} Another example is the [[#Unforgivable Curses|Cruciatus Curse]], which causes immense pain; as Harry discovers during a duel with [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], effective use of this forbidden dark magic requires sadistic desires.{{HP5}}\n\nLove (in its broadest meaning) is depicted as a particularly powerful form of magic. According to Dumbledore, love is a \"force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces of nature.\"{{HP5}} Lily's voluntary sacrifice on Harry's behalf saves him from Voldemort as a baby, and Harry makes a similar sacrifice to save his friends at the end of ''Deathly Hallows''.{{HP7}} A certain key prophecy in the series describes Harry as having \"power the Dark Lord knows not\", referencing his capacity for love.{{HP5}}\n\nTrue love is impossible to create magically; [[Potions in Harry Potter#Amortentia|Amortentia]], a love potion, can only create a powerful sense of infatuation and obsession.\n\n==Magical abilities==\nThe following is a list of special abilities that a wizard or witch in the Harry Potter universe may have.\n\n=== <span id=\"Animagi_transformation\"></span> Animagi ===\nAn Animagus ([[portmanteau]] of animal and [[Magic (supernatural)|magus]]) is a witch or wizard who can turn into a particular animal or magical creature at will. This ability is not innate: it must be acquired by magical means. All Animagi must register at a central authority by law, though a number of characters are revealed over the course of the series to have remained unregistered illegally: [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#James Potter|James Potter]], [[Sirius Black]], [[Death_Eater#Peter_Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and [[Rita Skeeter]]. \n \nAnimagi transformation can be performed wandlessly. Sirius and Peter are left wandless for over 10 years, but both retain the ability with no apparent ill effects. When Animagi transform, they take on the appearance of a normal animal. However, in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', it is noted that Ron's pet rat Scabbers (later revealed as Peter Pettigrew's Animagus form) has lived over twelve years when only expected to live three. Also, an Animagus in animal form retains the ability to think like a human, which is the principal difference between being an animagus and being transfigured into an animal. Otherwise, they would forget that they were a wizard and be trapped, unknowingly, in this form unless transformed back by another wizard. Characteristics of an Animagus' human form can manifest themselves in the animal transformation; for example, the markings around McGonagall's eyes as a cat resemble her glasses. When an Animagus registers, they must record all the defining physical traits of their animal form so that the Ministry can identify them.\n\nEach Animagus has a specific animal form, and cannot transform into any other animal. The animal cannot be chosen: it is uniquely suited to that individual's personality, and in most cases the Animagus will change into the same animal used in the person's [[Patronus Charm]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Pottermore Presents: Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies|publisher=Pottermore|isbn=978-1-78110-628-0}}</ref>  \n\nExplicit emphasis is placed in the books on the differences between Animagi and [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolves]]. Animagi have full control over their transformations and retain their minds, whereas werewolves' transformations are involuntary and include severe changes in personality. After the person has transformed into a werewolf \"...he no longer remembers who he is.  He'd kill his best friend. The werewolf only responds to the call of his own kind.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date=2004 |title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  |medium=Motion Picture |language=English |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id=  |oclc= |quote=Hermione during Defence against the Dark Arts as Snape substitutes for Lupin. |ref= }}</ref> The only way that a werewolf can retain his sanity, intelligence and memory while transformed is using the Wolfsbane Potion.\n\n===Metamorphmagi===\nA '''Metamorphmagus''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[metamorph]]'' and ''[[magus]]'') is a witch or wizard born with the innate ability to change some or all of their appearance at will. The talent cannot be acquired; a witch or wizard who has it must be born with it.\n\n[[Nymphadora Tonks]] and her son, [[Teddy Lupin]] are currently the only known Metamorphmagi in the series; it is a very rare ability, possibly hereditary. Tonks is known to change her hair colour and style according to her mood. She even appears as an old woman on occasion. She can also change her nose appearance, as she does when eating with the Weasley family to entertain Ginny and Hermione. Her son, Teddy Lupin, also inherited this trait, as his hair is mentioned repeatedly changing colour.\n\nThe extent of these appearance-altering abilities and the limits thereof are not entirely clear. According to Rowling, a Metamorphmagus can alter his or her appearance completely, for instance, from black to white, young to old, handsome to plain and so on.<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926035344/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41 |archivedate=2011 |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41|title=J.K. Rowling's Official Site, rumour section}}</ref> In one example, Tonks changes her facial appearance by reshaping her nose into \"a beaklike protuberance like Snape's\", to \"something resembling a button mushroom\", and \"one like a pig snout\" which reminded Harry of his cousin Dudley.<ref>Rowling, J.K.: \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", page 85. Scholastic, 2003</ref> The emotional state of a Metamorphmagus can affect their abilities.\n\n===Parseltongue===\n'''Parseltongue''' is the language of snakes. It is often associated with Dark Magic, although Dumbledore stated that it is not necessarily an evil quality. Those possessing the ability to speak it (\"'''Parselmouths'''\") occur very rarely. People apparently acquire the skill through learning or via a method of [[xenoglossia]], such as through genetic inheritance (or by use of Dark or dangerous Magic). Harry was a Parselmouth until the age of 17. ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' explains this was because of Voldemort's passing on some of his abilities to Harry the night he tried to kill him. ''Deathly Hallows'' reveals that a part of Voldemort's soul within Harry grants him this ability, which is later destroyed leaving Harry stripped of the ability.<ref name=\"J.K.

The predictions given through this ability can sometimes be [[self-fulfilling prophecies]], and Dumbledore states in ''Order of the Phoenix'' that not all of them come true, depending on the choices made by those mentioned. This would seem to indicate that a Seer predicts possible or likely events, at least in some cases. \n\nIn the [[Hall of Prophecy]] at the [[Department of Mysteries]], thousands upon thousands of glass spheres are imbued with records of prophecies made by Seers. Only a person mentioned in a prophecy can safely retrieve it; anyone else who tries to do so will be driven insane.\n\nAccording to McGonagall, true Seers are extremely rare. [[Sybill Trelawney]] is the only Seer portrayed in the books, and is considered an \"old fraud\" by her students -- although it is mentioned that Sybill's great-great-grandmother, Cassandra Trelawney, was a renowned Seer in her day. Trelawney is ultimately sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in the fifth book for her lack of ability.  She has, however, twice made true prophecies -- both of significance to Harry Potter -- but had no recollection of either prediction afterward.\n\n===Legilimency and Occlumency===\n'''Legilimency''' is the magical skill of extracting feelings and memories from another person's mind\u2014a form of magical \"[[telepathy]]\" (although Snape, an able practitioner of the art, dismisses the colloquial term \"mind-reading\", as a drastic oversimplification). It also allows one to convey visions or memories to another person, whether real or imaginary. A witch or wizard possessing this skill is called a '''Legilimens,''' and can, for example, detect lies and deceit in another person, witness memories in another person's past, or \"plant\" false visions in another's mind.\n\nThe counter-skill to Legilimency is '''Occlumency''' (and its user, known as an '''Occlumens'''), by which one can compartmentalize one's emotions, or prevent a Legilimens from discovering thoughts or memories which contradict one's spoken words or actions. An advanced form of Occlumency is planting false temporary memories inside an Occlumens' own head while blocking all other true memories, so if a Legilimens, even a highly skilled one, were to attempt to read the mind, he or she would find false memories only and believe everything was right.\n\nThe skills are first mentioned in ''Order of the Phoenix''. Legilimency and Occlumency are not part of the normal curriculum at Hogwarts, and most students would graduate without learning them. \n\nVoldemort, [[Severus Snape|Snape]], and Dumbledore are all skilled in Legilimency and Occlumency, albeit with the use of their wands. Voldemort is said to be the master of Legilimency by Snape, as he, in almost all cases, immediately knows if someone lied to him. In addition, in ''Deathly Hallows'', Voldemort repeatedly uses Legilimency to interrogate his victims. Voldemort practices Occlumency throughout the period of ''Half-Blood Prince'' to deny Harry access to his thoughts and emotions. However, in ''Deathly Hallows'', Voldemort repeatedly loses grip, resulting in occasional but very powerful burst of thoughts, visions and emotions to be sent to Harry.\n\nThroughout the books, Snape is repeatedly said to be highly skilled in Occlumency,<ref>Prince, Alan (2011). ''The True Story of Severus Snape: An Essay About Harry Potter's Most Disputed Character'', p. 52.</ref> explaining how he was able to deceive Voldemort for years. Even before ''Order of the Phoenix'', Harry has the impression that Snape can read minds.\n\nDuring the ''Order of Phoenix'' Snape is instructed by Dumbledore to give Harry lessons in Occlumency. Due to the antagonism between the two, and Harry's secret desire to know Voldemort's thoughts, he makes poor progress, and only once manages to overcome Snape and enter his mind.<ref name=\"{{HP5}}ch26\">{{HP5}}, chapter 26</ref>  In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry finally masters Occlumency\u2014shutting his mind to Voldemort\u2014when Dobby dies. He realises that his grief\u2014or as Dumbledore calls it, love\u2014is what can block out the Dark Lord.\n\nQueenie Goldstein, in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', is revealed to be a proficient Legilimens, born with the ability, as she is able to read the minds of Jacob Kowalski and others in the film, as well as sense and hear them from afar through their thoughts and emotions. Unlike Snape, Voldemort and Dumbledore however, she does not require a wand to cast the spells of Legilimency as the ability to read minds comes naturally to her.\n\n===Apparition and Disapparition===\n<!--CHECK THE BOOKS; THE NOUN FORMS OF \"APPARATE\" AND \"DISAPPARATE\" ARE \"APPARITION\" AND \"DISAPPARITION\", NOT \"APPARATION\" AND \"DISAPPARATION\".  THIS WAS AN AESTHETIC DECISION MADE BY J.K. ROWLING, AS SHE HAS SAID BEFORE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TWO FORMS.  THEY APPEAR AS \"APPARATION\" AND \"DISAPPARATION\" EARLIER ON, BUT THESE FORMS ARE MADE OBSOLETE BY \"APPARITION\" AND \"DISAPPARITION\", WHICH APPEAR IN OoTP, HBP, AND DH, THE THREE MOST RECENT BOOKS\u2014Editorial note, Ron splinched himself twice in DH, not HBP, amending now -->\n'''Apparition''' is a magical form of [[teleportation]], through which a witch or wizard can disappear (\"'''Disapparate'''\") from one location and reappear (\"'''Apparate'''\") in another. It is sometimes accompanied by a distinctive cracking or popping sound, though the more skilled wizards such as Dumbledore can Apparate \"so suddenly and silently\" that they seem to have \"popped out of the ground\". According to Harry, apparition is also accompanied by a very unpleasant squeezing sensation, as though being sent through a tight rubber tube.{{HP6}}\n\nThe Ministry of Magic licenses Apparition. A witch or wizard must be 17 years old or older and have a licence to Apparate as a means of transportation in much the same way real-world governments require individuals to have a [[driver's license|licence to drive a motor vehicle]]. Students at Hogwarts may attend Ministry-administered Apparition lessons during their sixth year, and take their examination once they turn seventeen. It is shown that although it is possible to Apparate without a licence, it is not usually done (unless in lessons) and is illegal. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry does not possess a licence, but since his Trace has been lifted, the Ministry is likely unaware that he does it.\n\nLearning to Apparate is difficult, and students run the risk of ''splinching''\u2014being physically split between the origin and destination\u2014which requires the assistance of the Ministry's [[Accidental Magic Reversal Squad]] to undo properly, although essence of [[Origanum dictamnus | dittany]] can also mend certain wounds. Splinching is quite common during lessons, and can be uncomfortable (and at times rather gruesome) depending on the body parts splinched, but is ultimately harmless if properly reversed. Although Ron can Apparate, he isn't terribly skilled at it, and splinches himself at least three times (once losing half an eyebrow, two fingernails and part of his arm). Harry and Hermione both pick up the skill quickly in comparison. As explained in the ''Half-Blood Prince'', there is no word spell to Apparate or Disapparate, but the caster has to concentrate on the location on which he has to apparate, needs to be fully focused on the spell, and also has to \"feel\" it through the whole body.\n\nIt has been indicated that it is considered rude to Apparate directly into a private area, such as a home. Dumbledore states in ''Half-Blood Prince'' that it would be \"quite as rude as kicking down the front door\". For this reason, and for reasons of security, many homes have Anti-Apparition spells protecting them from uninvited intrusions. The accepted way to travel to a home is to Apparate to a nearby location and continue to the final destination on foot. Apparition is considered unreliable over long distances, and even experienced users of the technique sometimes prefer other means of transport, such as [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomstick]]s. Rowling has stated that Apparating over long distances depends on the skill of the wizard, and \"Cross-continental Apparition would almost certainly result in severe injury or death.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Welcome to my new website!|url=https://www.jkrowling.com/welcome-to-my-new-website/|website=jkrowling.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Indeed, even the prodigiously skilled [[Lord Voldemort]] elects to fly back to England after visiting the far-flung [[Nurmengard]].\n\nFor reasons of security, the grounds and buildings of Hogwarts are protected by ancient Anti-Apparition and Anti-Disapparition spells, which prevent humans from Apparating on the school grounds. There is also a spell that prevents individuals from Disapparating, which Dumbledore places on the Death Eaters captured at the Ministry in ''Order of the Phoenix''; a sister spell, which allows one to Apparate into a location but prevents them from Disapparating out of it, is cast by the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade in concordance with the Caterwauling Charm. Dumbledore is the only person who can both Apparate and Disapparate from the school grounds, since he is the headmaster.\n\nA witch or wizard can use ''Side-Along Apparition'' to take others with them during Apparition. Dumbledore successfully transports Harry this way several times in ''Half-Blood Prince'', and Harry's first non-lesson attempt at the skill is the Side-Along Apparition with the weakened Dumbledore when they return from the seaside cave. \n\nIn the ''Order of the Phoenix'' film, Death Eaters and Order members Apparate and Disapparate in clouds of black and white smoke respectively. In the film, both sides also appear to be able to \"half-apparate\" in which their bodies were made out of smoke, giving them the ability to fly. Both times Fred and George apparated and disapparated, they did it with a ''pop'' as in the books.\n\nIn the books, the words \"Apparate\" and \"Disapparate\", like many other [[neologism]]s used by Rowling, are [[Capitalization|capitalised]], whereas established English words such as \"jinx\" and \"hex\" are not. The words themselves are most likely derived from the French ''appara\u00eetre'' and ''dispara\u00eetre'', meaning 'to appear' and 'to disappear'. Another possible derivation is from the English word \"apparition\", meaning \"a supernatural appearance of a person or thing; anything that appears, especially something remarkable or startling; an act of appearing\", which comes from the Latin ''\"apparitio\"'', meaning attendance. \"Disapparate\" probably comes from the same word but with the prefix \"dis-\" expressing negation or reversal.\n\n===Other teleportation===\nSome magical creatures have their own forms of instantaneous travel, such as a house elf's ability to teleport or a phoenix's ability to appear and disappear in a burst of flame. Unlike wizards, these creatures are not restricted by anti-Apparition magic. [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]], [[Kreacher]] and the rest of the house-elf population can Apparate within the Hogwarts grounds, as they demonstrate on multiple occasions, most notably when Dobby visits Harry in the hospital wing, and when Harry summons Dobby and Kreacher and assigns them to tail Draco Malfoy. [[Fawkes]] disapparates from the headmaster's office at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore when the latter evades arrest at the hands of Ministry officials in ''Order of the Phoenix''. \n\nSome magical devices like the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Floo Powder |Floo Network]], [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Portkeys|Portkeys]] and [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Vanishing Cabinet |Vanishing Cabinets]] also provide forms of magical teleportation.\n\n===Veela charm===\nAn ability attributed to [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#veela| Veela]] and those of Veela heritage, such as [[Fleur Delacour]], Veela charm is used to charm males, much as the [[Siren (mythology) |Siren]]s do in ''[[The Odyssey]]''. Men who are exposed to it over time become more resistant to it, although the Veela charm takes full effect if the Veela surprises the man, as noted by Ron in ''Half-Blood Prince''.\n\nAs shown in ''Goblet of Fire'', one can use Veela hair as cores in magical wands. According to famed wandmaker Mr. Ollivander, these wands are a little \"temperamental\".\n\n===Magical resistance===\nThis refers to a certain degree of immunity against hexes and spells found in powerful creatures such as [[trolls]], [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Dragons|dragons]], and [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Giants|giants]]. Hagrid is resistant to certain spells, like the Stunning Spell, due to his giant blood. This type of resistance is not insurmountable; if enough Stunning Spells, for example, are fired at a creature with magical resistance at once, the creature may still be rendered unconscious. Also, wizards and witches can resist certain spells with the power of their own sheer will, such as Harry did in ''Goblet of Fire'', when [[Barty Crouch Jr.]] disguised as Alastor Moody tried to control Harry with the Imperius curse and Harry resisted.\n\n==Subjects at Hogwarts==\nAt Hogwarts, students must study a core group of subjects for the first two years, after which they must choose between several electives. During their final two years, students are permitted to take more specialized subjects such as Alchemy.\n\nTransfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology are compulsory subjects for the first five years, as well as flying lessons. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Very specialised subjects such as [[Alchemy]] are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand. There is a total of twelve named [[Hogwarts staff|Professors]] at Hogwarts, each specializing in one of these subjects.\n\n===Transfiguration===\n'''Transfiguration''' is essentially the art of changing the properties of an object.<ref name=\"TransCharms\">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1998/1298-herald-simpson.html 1998: Accio Quote!, the Largest Archive of J.K. Rowling quotes on the web<!-- Bot generated title -->], quick-quote.quill.org</ref> Transfiguration is a theory-based subject, including topics such as \"Switching Spells\" (altering only a part of some object, such as when Hagrid gave Dudley a pig tail); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely disappear);{{OotP|ch=13}} and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air).{{OotP|ch=13}} It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa \u2013 Minerva McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigures her desk into a [[domestic pig|pig]] and back in ''Philosopher's Stone''.{{PStone |ch=8}}\n\n===Defence Against the Dark Arts===\n<!--DO NOT change this to \"DEFENSE\" with an S. As per [[MOS:HPP#ENGLISH]], we use British spelling in Harry Potter-related articles. Thank you.-->\n'''Defence Against the Dark Arts''', commonly shortened to '''D.A.D.A.''',<ref>{{HPref|book=6|chapter=12}}</ref> is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the [[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|Dark Arts]], and to be protected from Dark creatures. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', with Death-Eaters in charge of the school, the subject is renamed the '''Dark Arts''', and involves pupils practicing the [[#Unforgivable Curses|Cruciatus Curse]] on those who have earned detentions.{{DH|ch=29}} The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members\u2014throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject.  During the period the story takes place, the class is taught by [[Quirinus Quirrell]] ([[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|book one]]), [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] ([[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|book two]]), [[Remus Lupin]] ([[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|book three]]), [[Bartemius Crouch Jr]] impersonating [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-eye\" Moody]] ([[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|book four]]), [[Dolores Umbridge]] ([[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|book five]]), [[Severus Snape]] ([[Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince|book six]]), and [[Amycus Carrow]] ([[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|book seven]]). Hagrid suggests in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' that ''\"They're startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now.\"'' In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected.{{HBP|ch=20}} The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in ''Half-Blood Prince''. Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of ''Deathly Hallows'' and the [[epilogue]], set nineteen years afterwards. Furthermore, she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jen |last=Brown |title=Stop your sobbing!

Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic spell concerned with giving an object ''new'' and unexpected properties.<ref name=\"TransCharms\"/> Charms classes are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical.{{OotP|ch=18}} Many of the [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, which are on the second floor of Hogwarts. The class is taught by [[Filius Flitwick]].\n\n===Potions===\n{{Further|Potions in Harry Potter}}\n'''Potions''' is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures. As to the question of whether a Muggle could brew a potion, given the correct magical ingredients, Rowling has said, \"Potions seems, on the face of it, to be the most Muggle-friendly subject. But there does come a point in which you need to do more than stir.\"<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0801-radiocityreading1.html 2006: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web<!-- Bot generated title -->], quick-quote.quill.org</ref> Rowling later confirmed on [[Pottermore]] that \"There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Potions|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/potions|website=[[Pottermore]]|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Snape's lessons are depicted as unhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst Slughorn's, who replaces Snape as Potions Master, are shown as more cheerful and even fun at times.\n\n===Astronomy===\n'''Astronomy''' classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observations of the night skies with [[telescope]]s. No astronomy lessons are shown in the books, but they are frequently referenced. Rowling describes one of Harry's Astronomy exams in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Also, bits of the Astronomy Tower are seen throughout the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film series]], such as HP2 and HP3, and featured in ''[[Half-Blood Prince]]'', as the place where Dumbledore died, and seen in ''[[Deathly Hallows]]''. Known student homework activities include learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements, and environments.\n\n===History of Magic===\n'''History of Magic''' is the study of magical history. [[Cuthbert Binns]]' lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin rebellions, giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only class at Hogwarts that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed.\n\n===Herbology===\n'''Herbology''' is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise and combat them. There are at least three greenhouses described in the books, holding a variety of magical plants. Herbology is also the only subject Neville excels in. The epilogue to ''Deathly Hallows'' explains that he later replaces Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher.\n\n===Arithmancy===\n'''Arithmancy''' is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. As Harry Potter does not take this subject, the class is never described in the books. It is, however, a favourite subject of Hermione. Arithmancy is reportedly difficult, as it requires memorising or working with many charts. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', it is mentioned that the study of Arithmancy is required to become a Curse-Breaker for [[Gringotts]]. The subject is taught by Professor Septima Vector.\n\n===Study of Ancient Runes===\n'''Study of Ancient Runes''', more commonly known as '''Ancient Runes''', is a generally theoretical subject that studies the ancient runic scripts. Because only [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] studies it, little else is known about this subject, taught by Professor Bathsheda Babbling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Vander Ark |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-jottings1.html |title=HP-lexicon.org |publisher=HP-lexicon.org |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> In ''Deathly Hallows'' Dumbledore bequeaths his copy of ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'', which is written in ancient runes, to [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]].\n\n===Divination===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sybill Trelawney]] -->\n'''[[Divination]]''' is the art of predicting the future. Various methods are described, including [[Tasseography|tea leaves]], [[Divination|fire omens]], [[crystal ball]]s, [[palmistry]], [[cartomancy]] (including the reading of conventional [[playing cards]] and the [[tarot]]), [[astrology]], and [[dream interpretation]]s. Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as \"one of the most imprecise branches of magic\".{{PA|ch=6}} Supporters of the subject claim that it is an inexact science that requires innate gifts such as the \"Inner Eye\". Those opposed claim that the subject is irrelevant and fraudulent. Harry is first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by Firenze after Trelawney is sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in Harry's fifth year. In the sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney share Divination classes, divided by year.\n\n===Care of Magical Creatures===\n'''Care of Magical Creatures''' is the class which instructs students on how to care for [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical beasts]]. Classes are held outside the castle. In Harry's first two years, the class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then retires \"in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs\". Dumbledore then recruits the gamekeeper [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties. Although Hagrid is obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he doesn't \"have a normal person's view of what's dangerous\", an example being that the Care of Magical Creatures students were required to get a literally ferocious textbook called the \"Monster Book of Monsters\", and so consistently misjudges the risk that the animals he uses in his lessons pose to his students{{PA |ch=6}}{{GF |ch=13}}, which sometimes results in chaos. When Hagrid is absent, his lessons are taken over by Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, a witch and an acquaintance of Dumbledore's.\n\n===Muggle Studies===\n'''Muggle Studies''' is a class that involves the study of the [[muggle]] (non-magical) culture \"from a wizarding point of view.\" The only need for witches and wizards to learn about muggle [[culture|ways]] and [[technology|means]] is to ensure they can blend in with muggles while needing to do so (for example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). As the class is only mentioned as being taken by [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and for just one year, little is known about its curriculum.\nIn the opening chapter of the final book, Voldemort murders Professor [[Charity Burbage]] because she portrays muggles in a positive light and is opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of pure-blood origins. For the rest of the academic year covered by ''Deathly Hallows'', the Death Eater [[Alecto Carrow]] teaches Muggle Studies. However, her lessons (which are made compulsory) mainly describe muggles and muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.\n\n===Alchemy===\n'''Alchemy''' classes are not mentioned in the ''Harry Potter'' series; however, Rowling has used Alchemy as an example of a 'specialized' subject offered when there is sufficient demand. Alchemy is a philosophical tradition searching for the [[philosopher's stone]], which is said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and to contain the [[elixir of life]], which makes or keeps the drinker young and immortal. As mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Nicholas Flamel created a Philosopher's Stone, but it was destroyed at the end of Harry's first year.\n\n===Flying===\n'''Flying''' is the class that teaches the use of [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomsticks]] made for the use of flying and is taught only to Hogwarts first years by [[Rolanda Hooch]]. The subject is the only one that requires physicality. The only flying lesson depicted in the Harry Potter series is in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''; the class is never mentioned in following installments; and is not a part of the O.W.L. exams during Harry's fifth year.\n\n===Apparition===\n'''Apparition''' is an optional class for those in the sixth and seventh years at Hogwarts, in preparation for obtaining their license. In Harry's sixth year, [[Wilkie Twycross]], a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor, teaches the lessons. Magical enchantments on Hogwarts castle and grounds prevent Apparition and Disapparition inside the castle; however ''Half-Blood Prince'' explains that these protections are temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practice. Students are warned, though, that they will not be able to Apparate outside of the Great Hall and that it would be unwise to try. Splinching is a common mistake in apparition which causes body parts to split. It is impossible to track anyone by apparition unless the person grabs the apparator\u2019s clothing or body.\n\n==Spell-like effects==\n\n===Unbreakable Vow===\nThe '''Unbreakable Vow''' is a voluntary agreement made between two witches or wizards. It must be performed with a witness (\"Bonder\") on hand, holding their wand on the agreeing persons' linked hands to bind them with magic as a tongue of flame. The Vow is not literally \"unbreakable\" as the person taking it is still able to go back on his or her word, but doing so will cause instant death. The Unbreakable Vow was first introduced in ''Half-Blood Prince'', in which Snape made a promise to Narcissa Malfoy to protect Draco, with Bellatrix as the \"Bonder\", as her son attempted to fulfil the Dark Lord's task, and for Snape to fulfil the task if Draco fails. Another example in ''Half-Blood Prince'' occurs when Ron tells Harry how Fred and George tried to make him undertake an Unbreakable Vow, but because of their father's intervention, they did not succeed.\n\n===Priori Incantatem===\n'''Priori Incantatem''' (from Latin: ''priorem incantatum'' - '''a previous spell'''), or the '''Reverse Spell Effect''', is used to detect the spells cast by a wand. The spells cast by the wand will emerge in smoky or ghost-like replicas in reverse order, with the latest spell emerging first. It is first encountered in ''Goblet of Fire'' when the house elf Winky is found holding Harry's wand. This spell is used to reveal that it was indeed Harry's wand that cast the Dark Mark. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince]]'', it is revealed that the teenage Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents using his uncle Morfin's wand, knowing that, when examined, the wand would incriminate Morfin as the murderer. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry fears that a ''Priori Incantatem'' spell will be used on Hermione's wand after the [[Death Eaters]] get hold of it. This would reveal that she had accidentally broken his holly-and-phoenix-feather wand when a curse misfired and they both narrowly escaped Voldemort earlier. As a result, the protection of the shared cores was lost and, worse still, this would now be made known to Voldemort. During the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, the latter mentions that he knows that the holly and phoenix wand is destroyed, implying that the Priori Incantatem has indeed been performed on Hermione's wand, as they had feared.\n\nForcing two wands that share the source of their cores to do battle can also cause a more potent form of Priori Incantatem. The tips of the two wands will connect, forming a thick golden \"thread\" of energy, and the two wands' masters fight a battle of wills. The loser's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter|wand]] will regurgitate shadows of spells that it has cast in reverse order. This phenomenon occurs during the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of ''Goblet of Fire''. Their simultaneous spells (Harry and Voldemort cast \"Expelliarmus\" and \"Avada Kedavra\" respectively) trigger the threads, and as Voldemort loses the battle of wills, his wand regurgitates, in reverse order, echoes of the people his wand had last murdered: [[Cedric Diggory]]; [[Frank Bryce]]; [[Bertha Jorkins]]; as well as Harry's parents. Harry was previously informed by [[Mr. Ollivander]] that the holly wand that \"chose\" Harry was the \"brother\" of the yew wand that gave him the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, although the significance of this was not discussed then. Dumbledore later reveals to Harry that his and Voldemort's wands both contain a tail feather given by Dumbledore's pet [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]].\n\n==Dark Arts==\nThe '''Dark Arts''' are magical spells and practices that are usually used for malicious purposes. Practitioners of Dark Arts are referred to as Dark witches or wizards. The most prominent of these is Voldemort, known to them as the Dark Lord. His followers, known as [[Death Eater]]s, practice the Dark Arts while doing his bidding.\n\nThe type of spells characteristic of Dark Arts are known as curses,<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24 J.K. Rowling's Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124192524/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24 |date=24 January 2008 }}</ref> which usually cause harm to the target. All, to a certain degree, are in some circumstances justifiable. The motivation of the caster affects a curse's result. This is most notable in the case of ''Cruciatus'': when cast by Harry, angered by the death of his godfather at Bellatrix's hands AND desiring to punish her, it causes a short moment of pain. As Bellatrix herself comments, righteous anger does not allow the spell to work for long. When cast by figures such as Voldemort, who desire to inflict pain for its own sake, it causes intense agony that can last as long as the Dark witch or wizard desires. Use of Dark Magic can corrupt the soul and body; Voldemort has used such magic in his quest to prolong his life and obtain great power. The Dark Arts also cause Voldemort to look deformed and inhuman, a side effect of splitting his soul into Horcruxes.\n\nAccording to Snape, the Dark Arts \"are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal... unfixed, mutating, indestructible\".<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch9\">{{HP6}}, chapter 9</ref> In magical dueling, there are any number of spells that may be used to attack, immobilise, or disarm an opponent without causing pain or lasting harm; however, spells such as the Cruciatus Curse or Sectumsempra, judged to be Dark by reliable authorities, wound or seriously distress a victim in some way. Dark spells can be classified into three groups: jinxes, hexes & curses.\n\nIn the wizarding world, use of the Dark Arts is strongly stigmatised and some aspects are illegal; however, these spells are prevalent enough that even before the rise of Voldemort, many schools (including Hogwarts) taught [[Subjects at Hogwarts#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] as a standard subject. Techniques include anti-curses and simple spells to disable or disarm attackers or fight off certain creatures. Some schools, such as [[Durmstrang]], teach Dark Magic. A Dark Arts class is also taught at Hogwarts while it is under Death Eater control.\n\n===Unforgivable Curses===\nThe '''Unforgivable Curses''' are some of the most powerful known Dark Arts spells. They were first classified as unforgivable in 1717. Used by the books' villains, such as Voldemort and the [[Death Eater]]s and in some cases the Ministry of Magic, their use inspires horror and great fear amongst others. The curses are so named because their use is forbidden and unforgivable in the wizarding world and is punishable by a life sentence in [[Azkaban]]. The only exception is if a person is proved to have done them under the influence of mind control. These curses are thus very rarely used openly.\n\n*The '''Killing Curse''' (incantation: ''Avada Kedavra'') manifests as a jet of green light that causes immediate, painless death. The Killing Curse has no counter-curse and cannot be blocked by most magical means. It can be blocked by love. However, the green energy bolt may be dodged, blocked with solid objects or intercepted with a few other powerful fast spells, particularly Stunning spells.  [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is the only person known to have survived (twice), nullified (once) and deflected (once) this curse.\n*The '''Cruciatus Curse''' (incantation: ''Crucio'', Latin for \"I torture\") causes the victim intense pain and is used for [[torture]], but does not physically harm them. The strength of the curse is determined by the person who cast it. It was used regularly by the Death Eaters. The curse can  torture a person to the point that they are exhausted to death, or in a more sadistic case, it causes permanent amnesia and insanity. Effective casting requires the caster to have sadistic desires. It is shown as a bright-faded blue light (though it is usually invisible or even a red bolt of light in the films).\n*The '''Imperius Curse''' (incantation: ''Imperio'', faux Latin for \"I command\", cf. [[imperialism]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) is used for [[mind control]] or [[hypnosis]] and can force the victim to do things they would normally be unwilling or unable to. The strength and duration of the curse depends on the caster, as well as the level of resistance of the victim. The curse is shown as a bright haze (while it was either invisible or green, mist-like haze in the films). \n\nThe use of the Unforgivable Curses was authorised against Voldemort and his followers by [[Ministry of Magic#Barty Crouch, Sr|Bartemius Crouch Sr]], during the First Wizarding War. (Shortly after his resurrection, Voldemort names two Death Eaters \"killed by [[Ministry of Magic#Auror Office|Auror]]s\".) In addition, in ''Deathly Hallows'', the Unforgivable Curses are used liberally by good characters, ranging from [[Professor McGonagall]] with the Imperius Curse, to Harry effectively using the Cruciatus Curse. He also uses the Imperius Curse on a goblin and a suspicious Death Eater during their disguised attack upon Gringotts Bank.\n\n=== Dark Mark ===\nThe '''Dark Mark''' is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters and takes the form of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth in place of a tongue. The mark is cast into the sky by [[Death Eater]]s whenever they have murdered someone. The spell used by Death Eaters to conjure the Mark is ''Morsmordre''. It first appears in ''Goblet of Fire'' and is described as a \"colossal skull, composed of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue\". Once in the sky it was \"blazing in a haze of greenish smoke\".\nDark Marks are also branded on the left forearm of the closest followers of Voldemort. The mark serves as a connection between Voldemort and each who bears it; he can summon them by touching his mark, causing it and those of his followers to burn and change colour. Death Eaters can summon Voldemort in the same fashion.\nFollowing Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the Dark Marks on his Death Eaters fade into a scar \"similar\" to Harry's.<ref name=\"J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript\"/>\nIn the books, the Dark Mark is described as green; however, in the films, it was only green at the Quidditch World Cup. In all other film appearances it has been grey.\n\n===Inferius===\n{{Distinguish|Infernus (disambiguation){{!}}Infernus}}\nAn '''Inferius''' (plural: '''Inferi''') is a [[Dead body|corpse]] controlled through a Dark wizard's spells. An Inferius is not alive, but a dead body that has been bewitched into acting like a puppet for the [[witch]] or wizard; this manifests itself as a white mist in the controlled corpse's eyes. They cannot think for themselves: they are created to perform a specific duty assigned by the Dark wizard who commands them, and as seen in the Inferi guarding Voldemort's Horcrux in a seaside cave, remain idle until their task can be performed. This task is then thoughtlessly carried out, whether or not it will produce any result. Inferi are difficult to harm by magic; however, they can be repelled by fire or any other forms of heat or light, as the Inferi in Voldemort's cave had never been exposed to either of these elements. When defeated, they return to their idle state.\n\nInferi are considered dangerous and frightening enough by the magical world that impersonating an Inferius (as [[Mundungus Fletcher]] is reported to have done in ''Half-Blood Prince'') is an offence worthy of imprisonment in [[Azkaban]].\n\nThe Ministry of Magic fears that Voldemort is killing enough people to make an army of Inferi: as they are dead, they are very difficult to stop. When Voldemort was hiding one of his [[Horcruxes]] in the past, he filled a lake in a cave with many Inferi, which were to attack and drown anyone but Voldemort who came into the cavern and took the locket. When Harry and Dumbledore took the locket, the Inferi attacked Harry; Dumbledore repelled them with a rope of fire. It is also revealed that the Inferi almost killed Kreacher after he drank from the basin to help Voldemort hide his Horcruxes, but having been ordered to return to his master after his task with Voldemort was complete, he was able to apparate out of the cave. These Inferi later killed Regulus Black when he stole the Horcrux and ordered Kreacher to destroy it.\n\nIn Latin, the word ''inferus'' (plural: ''inferi'') means \"below\", often referring in the plural to \"the gods below\" (see ''[[di inferi]])'' or the spirits of the dead.<ref name=\"lexicon\">{{cite book| last=Lewis | first=Charlton T. | last2=Short | first2=Charles | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1879 | place=Oxford | chapter=q.v., inferus, as positive noun I.B, as comparative adjective II.A | chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dinferus }}</ref> ''Inferius'' is a neuter singular form of ''inferior'', a [[comparative adjective]] meaning \"lower\".<ref name=\"lexicon\"/><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=inferius&la=la Morphology of inferius by The Perseus Project]</ref>\n\n===Horcrux===\n{{See also|Magical objects in Harry Potter#Horcruxes}}\nA '''horcrux''' is an object created using dark magic to attain effective immortality. The concept is first introduced in the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', although horcruxes are present in earlier novels without being described or expanded upon.\n\nTo create a horcrux, a witch or wizard must first prepare the chosen object<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html|title=\"PotterCast Interviews J.K. Rowling, part one.\" (2007), Accio Quote!|website=www.accio-quote.org|access-date=2017-12-31}}</ref> in a ritual which is referred to only as \u201ctoo horrible to go into detail about\u201d. Following the preparation of the object, the witch or wizard must then take a life, an act which splits the soul. Following that, further dark rituals are required in order to remove the soul shard from the maker and place it into the prepared object. Once this is done, the Horcrux becomes impervious to almost all forms of destruction, requiring extremely powerful magic or substances to do so.\n\nOrdinarily, when one's body is killed, the soul departs for the next world. If, however, the body of a horcrux owner is killed, that portion of his soul which had remained in his body will not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard. If all of someone's horcruxes are destroyed, then his soul's only anchor in the material world would be his body, the destruction of which would then cause his final death. To destroy the horcrux, the destroyer must destroy it in such a way that it is put beyond magical repair. In the seventh book, Gryffindor\u2019s sword, Basilisk fang and Fiendfyre are the substances used to destroy them.\n\n==Portraits==\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' series the subjects of '''magical portraits''' (even those of characters that are dead) can move, interact with living observers, speak and demonstrate apparent emotion and personality. Some can even move to other portraits to visit each other, or relay messages, or (if more than one painting of the subject exists) move between separate locations by way of their portraits. An example of this is Phineas Nigellus Black, who has a painting in the Headmaster's office and at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Many such portraits are found on the walls of Hogwarts. \n\nSome portraits are used to conceal the entrance of a room or passageway. For example, the Fat Lady's portrait covers the entrance to the [[Hogwarts#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]] common room, and she can swing the portrait open when given the correct password or close to prevent entry. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', there is a portrait of Ariana Dumbledore in the [[Room of Requirement]] that conceals a secret passageway to the Hog's Head. There is also a painting of a large fruit bowl in front of the Hogwarts kitchen, which will swing open if the pear is tickled to reveal a hidden door.\n\nPortraits are enchanted to move by the artist, but the degree to which they can interact with others depends on the power of the subject.<ref name=\"portraits\">{{cite web|last1=Rowling|first1=J.K.|title=Hogwarts Portraits|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-portraits|website=Pottermore|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> Rowling has commented that a portrait is merely a faint imprint of the deceased subject, imitating their basic personality and thought patterns. They are therefore \"not as fully realised as ghosts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=JK Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J. K. Rowling Official Web Site|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043646/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|archivedate=21 July 2011}}</ref>  In ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' the portrait of Albus Dumbledore describes himself as only \"paint and memory\" and Professor McGonagall (his successor as headteacher of Hogwarts) comments that, although she speaks to Dumbledore to help her in making decisions, she is careful to remember that \"portraits don't represent even half of their subjects\". \n\n===Portraits in the Headmaster's office===\nThe portraits in the Headmaster's office depict all the former Heads of Hogwarts, with the exception of Dolores Umbridge. They advise the Headmaster and are \"honour-bound to give service to the present headmaster\" (according to Armando Dippet). Rowling has explained that portraits of past headteachers tend to be more realistic than most, as the subject in question usually imparts knowledge and teaches them how to behave before their death.  The portrait of Snape was installed in the Headmaster's Office at Harry's request.<ref name=\"portraits\"/>\n\n===The Fat Lady===\nThe portrait of '''the Fat Lady''' covers the door to [[Gryffindor]] Tower. She will open it (sometimes grudgingly) when the correct password is uttered. She is often upset after being awoken, and is sometimes seen drunk with her best friend, Violet. The Fat Lady has no other known name \u2013 even the unfailingly polite Albus Dumbledore refers to her only as \"the Fat Lady\" \u2013 and it may be that she does not represent a real person but is instead an invention of her portrait's artist. In ''Philosopher's Stone'', she leaves her portrait in the middle of the night, locking Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville out of Gryffindor Tower, forcing them to run across the school. Luckily for them, when they return, she has returned to her portrait, allowing them to escape into Gryffindor Tower. In ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', Sirius Black slashes the Fat Lady's portrait when she won't let him in without a password and it is some time before she dares to guard Gryffindor Tower again. After her portrait is restored, she requests protection in case someone tries to attack her portrait again. Thus, two security trolls are hired. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', she gets so annoyed with Harry's late return that she pretends the password has changed and tries to call him back when he heads off to talk to Dumbledore. When Harry later confirms Dumbledore's death, she lets out a sob and, for the only time in the series, she opens without the password for Harry in her grief.\n\nIn the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|first film]] the Fat Lady is played by [[Elizabeth Spriggs]], and by [[Dawn French]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]].\n\n===Photographs===\nWizarding photographs of people have similar properties to magical painted portraits: the figures within move about or even sometimes leave the frame. They appear in wizard newspapers and other print media, as well as on [[Harry Potter universe#Magical sweets|Chocolate Frog]] cards.{{HP1}} [[Colin Creevey]] mentions in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that a boy in his dormitory said that if he develops the film from his Muggle camera 'in the right potion', the pictures will move.<ref name=\"{{HP2}}ch6\">{{HP2}}, chapter 6</ref> However, unlike portraits, figures in wizarding pictures cannot speak and display little sentience. It appears that they do have some knowledge of current events, as in ''Order of the Phoenix'', the family photograph on Arthur's desk shows everyone except Percy \"who appeared to have walked out of it\".<ref name=\"{{HP5}}ch7\">{{HP5}}, chapter 7</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|author=Highfield, Roger|year=2002|title=The Science of Harry Potter: How magic really works|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-03153-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/scienceofharrypo00high}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Teare, Elizabeth|year=2002|chapter=Harry Potter and the technology of magic|editor=Whited, Lana A.|title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a literary phenomenon|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, Missouri|pages=29\u2013342|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9}}\n* {{Cite journal|author=Black, Sharon|year=2003|title=The Magic of Harry Potter: Symbols and Heroes of Fantasy|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=34|issue=3|pages=237\u2013247|doi=10.1023/A:1025314919836}}\n\n==External links==\n{{hpw|Magic}}\n\n{{Harry Potter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magic in Harry Potter}}\n[[Category:Harry Potter universe]]\n[[Category:Fiction about magic]]\n\n[[fr:Univers de Harry Potter#Magie]]\n", "name_user": "Linda Evans L", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDark Mark:Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter"}
