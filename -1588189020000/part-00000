A total of seven [[nuclear test]]s were performed, with [[Nuclear weapon yield|approximate yields]] ranging from {{convert|1|to|27|ktTNT|lk=on|sigfig=1}}. Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site: Operation Buffalo in 1956 and Operation Antler the following year. Operation Buffalo consisted of four tests; One Tree ({{convert|12.9|ktTNT}}) and Breakaway ({{convert|10.8|ktTNT}}) were detonated on towers, Marcoo  ({{convert|1.4|ktTNT}}) at ground level, and the Kite ({{convert|2.9|ktTNT}}) was released by a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Vickers Valiant]] bomber from a height of {{convert|35,000|ft|order=flip}}. This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft.\n\nOperation Buffalo was followed by Operation Antler in 1957, which tested new, light-weight nuclear weapons. Three tests were conducted in this series: Tadje ({{convert|0.93|ktTNT}}, Biak {{convert|5.67|ktTNT}}and Taranak {{convert|26.6|ktTNT}}. The first two were conducted from towers, while the last was suspended from balloons. Tadje used [[cobalt]] pellets as a tracer for determining yield, resulting in rumours that Britain was developing a [[cobalt bomb]]. Between 1956 and 1963, the Maralinga site was also used for minor trials, tests of nuclear weapons components not involving nuclear explosions. Kittens were trials of [[neutron initiator]]s; Rats and Tims measured how the [[fissile]] [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the high explosive shock wave; and Vixens investigated the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons. Ultimately, the minor trials generated more contamination than the major tests.\n\nThe site was left contaminated with [[radioactive waste]], and an initial clean up was attempted in 1967. The [[McClelland Royal Commission]], an examination of the effects of the minor trials and major tests, delivered its report in 1985, and found that significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga sites.  It recommended another clean up, which was completed in 2000 at a cost of [[AUD]] $108 million. Debate continued over the safety of the site and the long-term health effects on the traditional [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] custodians of the land and former personnel. In 1994, the Australian government paid compensation amounting to $13.5 million to the traditional owners, the [[Maralinga Tjarutja]] people. Their land was fully restored to them in 2014.\n\nBy the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some journalists investigated the subject and political scrutiny became more intense. Journalist [[Brian Toohey]] ran a series of stories in the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission. In June 1993, ''[[New Scientist]]'' journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article titled \"Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga\" and several related articles. In 2007, ''[[Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up]]'' by [[Alan Parkinson (engineer)|Alan Parkinson]] documented the unsuccessful clean-up at Maralinga. Popular songs about the Maralinga story have been written by [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] and [[Midnight Oil]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring the early part of the [[Second World War]], Britain had a [[nuclear weapon]]s project, code-named [[Tube Alloys]],{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}} which the 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] merged with the American [[Manhattan Project]] to create a combined American, British, and Canadian project. The British government expected that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, after the war, but the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act) ended technical co-operation.{{sfn|Jones|2017|pp=1\u20132}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} under the cover name \"[[High Explosive Research]]\".{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=24, 48, 57}}\n\n[[File:United Kingdom Minister for Defence, Mr Duncan Sandys on a tour of Australia.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Minister of Defence (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Minister of Defence]], [[Duncan Sandys]] (centre) meets with [[Howard Beale (politician)|Howard Beale]] (right), the Australian [[Department of Supply|Minister for Supply]] in August 1957.]]\nAt the time Britain was still Australia's largest trading partner, although it was overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. Britain and Australia still had strong cultural ties, and the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Robert Menzies]], who came to office in 1949, was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, mainly because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting together in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Malayan Emergency]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=20\u201321}} Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing British forces in the Middle East and Far East.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=82\u201385}}\n\nThe Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on both [[nuclear power]] and nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=21\u201322}} and was particularly interested in developing the former, as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=21\u201322}} Plans for nuclear power were considered along with [[hydroelectricity]] as part of the post-war [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]],{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=147}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=54, 122\u2013128}}  but the 1948 ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'', to which Australia was not a party, cut Australian scientists off from technical information to which they formerly had access.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=109\u2013111}} Britain would not share it with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise the far more important relationship with the United States,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=21}} and the Americans were reluctant to do so after the [[Venona project]] revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=92\u201393}} The creation of [[NATO]] in 1949 excluded Australia from the Western Alliance.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|p=166}}\n\nOn 3 October 1952 the United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon in [[Operation Hurricane]] in the [[Montebello Islands]] off the coast of [[Western Australia]].{{sfn|Jones|2017|p=25}} A year later the first nuclear tests on the Australian mainland were carried out in [[Operation Totem]] at [[Emu Field]] in the [[Great Victoria Desert]] in [[South Australia]], with a detonation on 15 October and a second two weeks later on 27 October.<ref name=\"modkey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/470D247F-7615-460C-9829-DDAF99F88D39/0/Key_Events.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/470D247F-7615-460C-9829-DDAF99F88D39/0/Key_Events.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 October 2012 |title=Key events in the UK atmospheric nuclear test programme |publisher=UK Ministry of Defence |accessdate=27 June 2009 }}</ref> The Australian [[Department of Supply|Minister for Supply]], [[Howard Beale (politician)|Howard Beale]], stated in 1955 that \"England has the know how; we have the open spaces, much technical skill and a great willingness to help the Motherland.

In May 1953, the UK [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] were advised that one was needed. They delegated the task of finding one to [[Air Marshal]] Sir [[Thomas Elmhirst]],{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=87}}  the chairman of the Totem Executive (Totex), which had been formed in the UK to coordinate the Operation Totem tests.{{sfn|McClelland|1985a|p=139}} He wrote to [[J. E. S. Stevens]], the [[permanent secretary]] of the Australian Department of Supply, and the chairman of the Totem Panel that coordinated the Australian contribution to Operation Totem,{{sfn|McClelland|1985a|p=139}} and outlined the requirements of a permanent test site, which were:\n* A {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip}} radius free of human habitation;\n* Road and rail communications to a port;\n* A nearby airport;\n* A tolerable climate for staff and visitors;\n* Low rainfall;\n* Predictable weather conditions;\n* Winds that would carry the fallout safely away from inhabited areas; and\n* Reasonably flat terrain;\n* Isolation for security.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=87\u201388}}{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=227}}\n\nElmhirst suggested that a site might be found in [[Groote Eylandt]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] or north of Emu Field, where it could be connected by road and rail to [[Oodnadatta]], and where water could more easily be found than at Emu Field.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=228\u2013229}} Stevens rated both as unsuitable; Groote Eylandt was wooded and rocky, with a pronounced rainy season, no port facilities, and a long way from the nearest major settlements of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Cairns]]; while the area north of Emu Field had scarce water, few roads and was on the axis of the [[Long Range Weapons Establishment]].{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=247\u2013248}} [[Group Captain]] [[Alfred George Pither|George Pither]] conducted an aerial survey of the area north of the [[Trans-Australian Railway]] between [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] and [[Cook, South Australia]]. This was followed by a ground reconnaissance in four [[land rover]]s and two four-wheel drive trucks by Pither, [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Kevin Connolly, Frank Beavis (an expert in soil chemistry), [[Len Beadell]] and the two truck drivers.{{sfn|Beadell|1967|p=162}}{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=249\u2013250}} An area was found north of Ooldea, and a temporary airstrip was created in two days by land rovers pulling a length of railway line, where Penney, [[Flight Lieutenant]] Charles Taplin and Chief Scientist [[Alan Butement]] landed in a [[Bristol Freighter]] on 17 October 1953, two days after the Totem 1 test at Emu Field.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=230}}\n\n[[File:Emu - Ooldea - Tietkens Well reconnaissance - Photo 22.jpg|thumb|left|Emu-Ooldea-Tietkens Well reconnaissance]]\nThe site, initially known as X.300, was nowhere near as good as the Nevada Test Site, with its excellent communications, but was considered acceptable.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=89}} It was flat and dry, but not affected by dust storms like Emu Field, and the geologists were confident that the desired {{convert|2.5|e6impgal|Ml e6USgal e6impgal|order=out|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} per annum could be obtained boring.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=89}}{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=236}} Rainwater tanks were recommended, and it was estimated that if that [[bore water]] could not be obtained, a water pipeline could be laid to bring water from [[Port Augusta]]. This was estimated to cost [[Australian pound|AU \u00a3]]53,000 to construct and AU \u00a350,000 per annum to operate.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=236}} On 25 November, Butement officially named the X.300 site \"Maralinga\" in a meeting at the Department of Supply.  This was an Aboriginal word meaning \"thunder\", but not in the [[Western Desert language]] of the local people; it came from Garik, an extinct language originally spoken around [[Port Essington]] in the [[Northern Territory]].{{sfn|Tynan|2016|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nOn 2 August 1954, the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Australia|High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia]] lodged a formal request for a permanent proving ground for multiple series of nuclear tests expected to be conducted over the course of the next decade{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=241}} and a preliminary agreement between the Australian and British governments was reached on 26 August.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=472}} A mission consisting of six officials and scientists headed by J.

A formal Memorandum of Arrangements for use of Maralinga was signed on 7 March 1956.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=472}} It specified that the site would be available for ten years; that no thermonuclear tests would be carried out; that the UK government would be liable for all claims of death or injury to people or damage to property as a result of the tests, except those to UK government personnel; that Australian concurrence would be required before any test could be carried out; and that the Australian authorities would be kept fully informed.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=245\u2013246, 284\u2013287}}\n\nMaralinga was to be developed as a joint facility, co-funded by the British and Australian governments.<ref name=\"natarchive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs129.aspx |title=Fact sheet 129: British nuclear tests at Maralinga |access-date=27 June 2009}}</ref> The range covered {{convert|20000|sqmi|order=flip}}, with a {{convert|100|sqmi|adj=on|order=flip}} test area.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=235}} With savings arising from the relocation of buildings, stores and equipment from Emu Field taken into account, the cost of developing Maralinga as a permanent site was estimated to cost AU \u00a31.9 million, compared with AU \u00a33.6 million for Emu Field.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=237}} The British government welcomed Australian financial assistance, and Australian participation avoided the embarrassment that would have come from building a UK base on Australian soil. On the other hand, it was recognised that Australian participation would likely mean that the Australians would demand access to even more information than in Operation Totem. This had implications for Britain's relationship with the United States. Sharing information with the Australians would make it much harder to secure Britain's ultimate goal, of restoring the wartime nuclear [[Special Relationship]] with the United States, and gaining access to information pertaining to the design and manufacture of US nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Temporary Access Road - Watson - Tietkens Well.jpg|thumb|Cutting a temporary access road from Watson to Tietkens Well]]\nA railhead and a quarry were established at [[Watson, South Australia|Watson]], about {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip}} west of Ooldea, and Beadell's bush track from Watson to Emu became the main line communications for the project. It ran north to the edge of the [[Nullarbor Plain]], then over sand hills and the Leisler Range, a [[mallee (habit)|mallee]], [[spinifex (plant)|spinifex]] and [[santalum acuminatum|quandong]] cobered escarpment, rising to an altitude of {{convert|1000|ft|m|order=flip}}. Range headquarters, known as The Village, and an airstrip with a  {{convert|6500|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} runway were built near the {{convert|26|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} peg. The track continued north over scrub-cover sand hills to the Teitkins Plain. There at a point that came to be known as Roadside, a control point was established for entry to the forward area where bombs were detonated.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=473}}\n\nThe UKMOS engaged a firm of British engineering consultants, [[Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners]], to design the test facilities and supervise their construction. The work was carried out by the Kwinana Construction Group (KCG) under a [[cost-plus contract]]. It had just finished the construction of an oil refinery near [[Fremantle]], and it was hoped that it could move on to the new venture immediately, but the delay in obtaining Cabinet's approval meant that work could not start until mid-1955, by which time most of its work force had dispersed. This caused a cascading series of delays.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=473}} Assembling a labour force of 1,000 from scratch in such a remote location proved difficult, even when KCG was offering wages as high as AU \u00a340 a week ({{Inflation|AU|80|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=AUD$}}).{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=474}}\n\nThe Australian government elected to create a tri-service task force to construct the test installations. The Australian Army's Engineer in Chief, [[Brigadier]] [[Ronald McNicoll]] designated Major [[Owen Magee]], the Commander, [[Royal Australian Engineers]], [[Western Command (Australia)|Western Command]], to lead this task force. He joined a party headed by [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] John Blomfield, the UKMOS Atomic Weapons representative in Australia, on a site inspection, and then flew to the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE) at [[Aldermaston]] in the UK in a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Handley Page Hastings]] to review the plans. These were still incomplete, but it gave Magee sufficient information to prepare estimates of the labour and equipment that would be required.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=474}} The job involved the erection of towers, siting of instrument mounts, grading of {{convert|190|mi|order=flip}} of tracks, laying control cables and power lines, and construction of bunkers and other facilities dispersed over an area of {{convert|80|mi2|km2|order=flip}} but sited to within an accuracy of {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip}}. The work force could not be fully assembled before 1 March, but the facilities had to be ready for use by the end of July.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=475}} Magee prepared Blomfield a list of stores and equipment. These ranged from timber and nails to drafting gear and two {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on}} wagon drills.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=475}}\n\n[[File:Maralinga Committee visits the site.jpg|thumb|left|Maralinga Committee visits the site. Butement is third from the left.]]\nThe task force, which began assembling in February, included a section from the [[Royal Australian Survey Corps]],{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=475}} a troop of the 7th Field Squadron, detachments from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and a civilian from the [[Department of Works and Housing]]. Their first task was establishing their own camp, with tents, showers and toilets.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=476}} A team from the South Australian Department of Mines sank a series of {{convert|300|to|1150|ft|adj=on|order=flip|-1}} bores to provide water. Like that at Emu Field, the bore water was brackish. Two Army skid-mounted {{convert|3000|usgal/d|kl/d usgal/d impgal/d|order=out|adj=on}} Cleaver-Brooks [[Vapor-compression desalination|thermocompression]] distillation units provided water for drinking and cooking.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=476}}{{sfn|United States War Department|1945|pp=199\u2013204}} Work on the facilities themselves got off to a slow start, as KCG was running behind schedule, and unable to release promised earthmoving plant.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=476}} Some [[grader]]s were used by day by KCG and by night by the task force. A call to Blomfield resulted in a grader being shipped from Adelaide to Watson two days later. The arrival of a 23-man detachment of the Radiation Detection Unit of the [[Corps of Royal Canadian Engineers]] was expedited so they arrived in June, and were able to pitch in with the construction effort.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=477}} In July, supplies coming from the UK were delayed by industrial action at the port of Adelaide.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=476}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91216883 |title=Major Ports Idle on Award Issue |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=30 |issue=8,900 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=3 July 1956 |access-date=17 November 2019 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe work involved laying, testing and burying some {{convert|190|mi|order=flip}} of control cable. Each {{convert|1600|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} spool of cable weighed about {{convert|1|LT|t|0|order=flip}}, so where possible they were pre-positioned. The trenches were dug by a cable plough towed by a [[Caterpillar D8]] tractor. In some cases the limestone was too hard for the plough and the cable was buried by using a grader to cover the cable to the required depth. A similar procedure was followed for laying {{convert|8000|ft|order=flip}} of power cable. Some 1,300 scaffold frames were erected for mounting instrumentation, held in place by 33,000 anchor pipes. Bunkers ranging in size up to {{convert|1600|cuft|order=flip}} were excavated with explosives and a {{convert|350|cuft/min|adj=on|-1|order=flip}} compressor mounted on a four-wheel drive 3-ton Bedford truck connected to the jackhammer part of the 4-inch wagon drill. Explosives were in the form of {{convert|5|lb|adj=on|order=flip}} tubes of Geofex left over from a [[Bureau of Mineral Resources]] seismic survey of the area. The bunker work proceeded so well that the task force was able to assist KCG with its pit excavation work. Some instrument bunkers contained {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|order=flip|sigfig=1}} steel cubes. Getting them into the holes was tricky because they weighed {{convert|30|LT|t LT ST|order=out}}, and the largest available crane was a {{convert|25|LT|t LT ST|adj=on|order=out}} Coles crane. They were manoeuvred into place with the assistance of a TD 24 bulldozer. The Coles crane was also used to erect the two {{convert|100|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} shot towers. Concrete was made ''in situ'', using local quarry dust, limestone and bore water. The Canadians erected metal sheds of a commercial design, which were used to assess blast damage. A tented camp was built for observers at 11-mile by the 23rd Construction Squadron.{{sfn|Greville|2002|pp=478\u2013479}}\n\n[[File:Giles Weather Station in 1955.jpg|thumb|Giles Weather Station in 1955. The 44-gallon drums hold bore water.]]\nPressed for time, Magee became involved in a series of disputes with the Woomera Range commander, who tried to divert his sappers onto other tasks. In June, the range commander ordered the surveyors to return to Adelaide, which would have brought the work at Maralinga to a halt. Magee went over his head and appealed to the commander of [[4th Military District (Australia)|Central Command]], [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Arthur Gillespie Wilson|Arthur Wilson]], who flew up from Adelaide and sacked the range commander. Impressed by what he saw at Maralinga, Wilson arranged for the task force to receive a special Maralinga allowance of 16 [[Australian shilling]]s per day ({{Inflation|AU|1.6|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=AUD$}}), and additional leave of two days per month. The British government added a generous meal allowance of [[GBP]] \u00a31 ({{Inflation|AU|3.2|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=AUD$}}) per day, resulting in a diet of steak, ham, turkey, oysters and crayfish. In June, Beale flew in two planeloads of journalists, including [[Chapman Pincher]] and [[Hugh Buggy]] for a press conference. The task force completed all its work on 29 July, two days ahead of schedule, although KCG still had a few remaining tasks.{{sfn|Greville|2002|pp=480\u2013481}}\nBy 1959, the Maralinga village would have accommodation for 750 people, with catering facilities that could cope with up to 1,600. There were laboratories and workshops, shops, a hospital, church, power station, post office, bank, library, cinema and swimming pool.

The construction of the Trans-Australian Railway in 1917 had disrupted their traditional patterns of movement. [[Walter MacDougall]] had been appointed the Native Patrol Officer at Woomera on 4 November 1947, with responsibility for ensuring that Aboriginal people were not harmed by the LRWE's rocket testing program. He was initially assigned to the Department of Works and Housing but was transferred to the Department of Supply in May 1949.

For this he employed three strategies. The first was to remove the incentive to go there. An important lure was the availability of rations at Ooldea and surrounding missions, so he had them closed. The Ooldea mission was closed in June 1952, and the reserve was revoked in February 1954. The inhabitants were moved to a new settlement at [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]], but many ritual objects had been concealed and left behind, and the people preferred the landscape of the desert, and many people left Yalata to return to their traditional lands. A more successful tactic was to frighten them. The desert was said to be inhabited by [[Rainbow Serpent|wanampi]], dangerous rainbow serpent spirits that lived in blowholes in the area. The noise of the nuclear tests was attributed to wanampi, as were the dangers of radiation.{{sfn|Brady|1999|pp=5\u20138}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131712516 |title=Wanampi |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=52 |issue=14,996 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=28 January 1978 |accessdate=3 December 2019 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> A complicating factor was the decision to establish the [[Giles Weather Station]] in the [[Rawlinson Ranges]]. This was outside MacDougall's jurisdiction, being just across the border in Western Australia, and the people there had little contact with white people. Another patrol officer position was created, with powers under the 1954 Western Australian Native Welfare Act, which was filled by a [[Sydney University]] graduate, Robert Macaulay.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=277}}\n\n== Operation Buffalo ==\n{{Infobox nuclear weapons test\n |name                = Buffalo\n |picture             = File:Buffalo R4 001.jpg\n |picture_description = Buffalo R4/Breakaway nuclear test\n |country             = United Kingdom\n |test_site           = Maralinga Range, SA\n |period              = 27 September-22 October 1956\n |number_of_tests     = 4\n |test_type           = air drop, dry surface, tower\n |max_yield           = {{convert|15|ktTNT|lk=in}}\n |previous_series     = [[Operation Mosaic]]\n |next_series         = [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga#Operation Antler|Operation Antler]]\n}}\n\n=== Planning and purpose ===\nOperation Buffalo was the first nuclear test series to be conducted at Maralinga, and the largest ever held in Australia.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=474}} Planning for the  series, initially codenamed Theta, began in mid-1954. It was initially scheduled for April and May 1956, but was pushed back to September and October, when meteorological conditions were most favourable. Ultimately all tests on the Australian mainland were conducted at this time of year. The 1954 plan for Operation Theta called for four tests, each with a different purpose.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe UK's first nuclear weapon, [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]], was large and cumbersome, being {{convert|24|ft|order=flip}} long and {{convert|5|ft|order=flip}} wide, and weighed {{convert|10000|lb|order=flip}}, so only the Royal Air Force (RAF) [[V-bombers]] could carry it.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}  In November 1953, the RAF and [[Royal Navy]] issued an [[List of Operational Requirements for nuclear weapons|Operational Requirement]], OR.1127, for a smaller, lighter weapon with similar yield that could be carried by tactical aircraft.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=81}} A second requirement for a light-weight bomb arose with the British government's decision in July 1954 to proceed with a [[British hydrogen bomb programme]].{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=53\u201357}} Hydrogen bombs required an atomic bomb as a primary, and one was incorporated in the British hydrogen bomb design, known as [[Green Granite]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nIn response, Aldermaston developed a new warhead called [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard]] that was half the size of Blue Danube and weighed one-fifth as much, mainly through innovation in the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] design, principally the use of an \"air lens\".{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}} Instead of the core being immediately inside the tamper, there was an air gap between them, with the core suspended on thin wires. This allowed the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The concept had been developed by the Manhattan Project in 1945 and 1946, and permitted a reduction in both the size of the core and the amount of explosives required to compress it.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=199\u2013201}}\n\nThe first test on the agenda was therefore of the new Red Beard design. OR.1127 also specified a requirement for the device to have variable yields, which Aldermaston attempted to achieve through the addition of small amounts of thermonuclear material, a process known as \"boosting\". A {{convert|300|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} tower was built at Maralinga for a boosted weapon test, in case sufficient [[lithium deuteride]] could not be produced in time for the Operation Mosaic G2 test. In the event, it was available, and G2 went ahead as scheduled. Various tests of the effects of nuclear weapons were considered, but only one thought to be worth the effort was a test of a ground burst. These were known to produce more fallout and less effect than air bursts, and had therefore been avoided by the Americans, but such a test might produce useful information that the UK might trade with them. A ground test was therefore included in the schedule. A fourth test was an operational test. While the physics package of Blue Danube had been tested, there had been no test of the device in its operational form, so one was included in the Operation Buffalo program.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe interdepartmental Atomic Trials Executive in London, chaired by [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[Frederick E.

Once again the politicians arrived but returned disappointed. This put Penney under great pressure. On the one hand, if Maralinga was to be used for many years then riding roughshod over Australian concerns about safety at an early date was inadvisable; on the other, there was the urgent need to test Red Beard in time for the upcoming [[Operation Grapple]], the test of a British hydrogen bomb. Which was more important was the subject of debate in the UK between [[Willis Jackson, Baron Jackson of Burnley|Willis Jackson]], who argued for Maralinga, and [[William Richard Joseph Cook|Bill Cook]], who argued for Grapple.

In the hope that sharing the results might lead to fuller cooperation, the test had been discussed with the Americans by the [[British Joint Staff Mission]] in Washington, DC, and they had been sufficiently interested to offer the use of American instrumentation and personnel.

This reflected growing disquiet among the scientific community and the public at large over the effects of all atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, not just those in Australia, and growing calls for a test ban.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91226075 |title=Scientists Seek Ban On H-bomb Tests |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=31 |issue=8,999 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=26 October 1956 |access-date=24 November 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=421\u2013423}} Nonetheless, Operation Buffalo had attracted little international attention.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=177}} The British government rejected calls for a moratorium on testing, and announced at the US-UK talks in [[Bermuda]] in March 1957 that it would press on with the Operation Grapple hydrogen bomb tests.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article236322763 |title=H-Tests Must End |newspaper=[[Tribune]] |issue=991 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 March 1957 |access-date=24 November 2019 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Martin's proposal was accepted, and the composition of the new NRAC was announced on 7 July 1957.<ref>The committee consisted of Sir [[MacFarlane Burnet]] (Director of the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research]]); Professor Sydney Sunderland ([[University of Melbourne]]); Professor [[Philip Baxter]] (Australian Atomic Energy Commission); Sir Leslie Martin (University of Melbourne); Professor Ernest Titterton (Australian National University); Dr. W.

By mid-June 1957, they included up to seven tests: of a surface-to-air warhead called Blue Fox, a small warhead called Pixie, four different versions of Red Beard, and a round designed to test the principle of radiation implosion. Initially it was planned to test Blue Fox (later renamed Indigo Hammer) in both boosted and unboosted form, but the disappointing results of boosting thus far meant that the benefit of boosting would be too small to warrant it, and this version was discarded. Pixie was an even smaller, lightweight ({{convert|250|lb|adj=on|order=flip}}) warhead with a [[plutonium]] core under consideration for use with the Royal Navy's [[Seaslug missile]]. Its drawback was that it required enough plutonium to build two Red Beards, and plutonium was scarce and expensive.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=183\u2013186}} In February 1957, the Australian authorities were notified of plans for six tests, including three using balloons, with maximum yields of up to {{convert|80|ktTNT}}.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=500}}\n\nThe UK had considerable experience with [[barrage balloon]]s during the Second World War but the proposed use of balloons to carry warheads to a higher altitude than achievable with a tower was an innovation for Operation Antler. Use of balloons did away with the engineering effort to build towers, and allowed a test site to be re-used, saving on the effort to construct instrumentation sites and lay cables. Most importantly, whereas low-level detonations sucked up contaminated radioactive dirt from the ground and the vaporised tower, a high-altitude detonation created fallout only from the bomb itself, and were therefore much cleaner.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=176, 190}} While accepting this point, the AWTSC was apprehensive about the consequences of a runaway balloon carrying a live atomic bomb.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=440}} Bill Saxby and J. T. Tomblin from Aldermaston and an RAF balloon expert visited the Nevada Test Site to observe the work Americans were doing with balloons, and it was suggested that Titterton should also visit Nevada.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=178}} Safety procedures were developed that included, in an extreme circumstance, shooting down the balloons. Titterton and Beale then accepted the use of balloons.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=195}}\n\nIn July 1957, the Australian government was informed of the UK authorities' decision to limit Operation Antler to just three tests. There would be two tower tests of {{convert|1.5|ktTNT}} and {{convert|3|ktTNT}}, codenamed Tadje and Biak respectively, and only one balloon test, a {{convert|20|ktTNT|adj=on}} test codenamed Taranaki.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=441}} Helping the Pixie test (which became known as Tadje) remain on the schedule was the deletion of Red Beard tests. It was decided that the third test would be of a Red Beard with a composite core of uranium-plutonium core, which had not yet been tested, while the pure plutonium Red Beard would go into production without further testing.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=183\u2013186}}\n\n[[File:Atomic test site at Maralinga - Workshops.jpg|thumb|right|Atomic test site at Maralinga \u2013 Workshops]]\nCharles Adams was appointed the test director, with J.

This was by far the largest of the three service components, with 31 aircraft and about 700 men, including a 70-man balloon detachment. Most of the aircraft were based at [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] near Adelaide, although the [[Avro Shackleton]]s were based at [[RAAF Base Pearce]] near [[Perth]] in Western Australia.

The meteorologists predicted a short break in the weather the following day, but with morning fog until 10:00. The fog cleared up by around 03:30. It was decided to detonate at 10:00 despite forecasts that some fallout would be deposited on the Taranaki test site. The yield was around {{convert|6|ktTNT}} as expected, but the cloud rose much higher: {{convert|24000|ft|order=flip}} instead of the forecast {{convert|14000|ft|order=flip}}, with a secondary cloud forming at {{convert|15000|ft|order=flip}}. Weather conditions were good, but as feared, fallout was deposited on the Taranaki site.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985a|pp=356\u2013357}}\n\n===Taranaki===\nWhile Tadje and Biak were fired from towers, Taranaki was the balloon test. A contract was let for {{convert|110000|cuft|adj=on}} balloons, but it soon became clear that they could not be produced in time, so {{convert|70000|cuft|adj=on}} balloons were substituted, of a type used by the [[Blue Joker]] project. These were capable of bearing loads of up to {{convert|9000|lb|order=flip|-3}} in winds of up to {{convert|30|kn|km/h|-1|order=flip}}, but three were required to lift a bomb aloft instead of two. Field trials were held at [[RAF Cardington]] in [[Bedfordshire]] in February 1957. Twelve were shipped to Maralinga, but inflated balloons were not kept in hangars as they had been at Cardington, but moored in the open. On 4 September a storm struck Maralinga, with lightning and wind gusts of up to {{convert|40|kn|km/h|-1|order=flip}}, and three balloons were ignited and completely destroyed. Adams requested that another balloon and spare rigging be despatched from the UK.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=197}}\n\nTaranaki was tentatively scheduled for 7 October, but high upper-level winds caused a postponement. It was eventually decided to fire at 16:15 on 9 October. The yield was around {{convert|26.6|ktTNT}}, somewhat higher than expected, but the cloud rose to {{convert|23000|ft|order=flip}} with a secondary cloud forming at {{convert|10000|ft|order=flip}}, which was much lower than the {{convert|28300|ft|order=flip}} expected.  Since the Australian government had not set limits on fallout, the AWTSC accepted the recommendations of the NRAC. The result was that the permissible limits were double that of those set for the Operation Buffalo tests. As a result of the balloon detonation, the fireball did not touch the ground, and fallout was limited in both volume and extent.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985a|pp=356\u2013357}} The use of balloons was thus revealed to be far more difficult than anticipated, but the anticipated advantages were realised, and balloons would subsequently be used successfully in the Operation Grapple tests on [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=197}}\n{{-}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: center;\"\n |+ United Kingdom's Antler series tests and detonations\n |-\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Name\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Date + time ([[Universal Time|UTC]])\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Local time zone\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |[[List of nuclear test sites|Location]]\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Elevation + height\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Delivery\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Purpose\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |[[List of nuclear weapons|Device]]\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |[[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]]\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n |-\n !

These experiments were  [[subcritical testing|subcritical tests]] involving testing of nuclear weapons or their components, but not nuclear explosions. The four series of minor trials were codenamed Kittens, Tims, Rats and Vixens, and involved experiments with plutonium, uranium, [[polonium]] and [[beryllium]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=215}} They were called \"Minor Trials\" until October 1958, when they were renamed \"Assessment Tests\"{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=395}} The name change were made in the wake of the international moratorium on nuclear testing, which began on 31 October 1958. The position of the British government was that the minor trials were not covered by the moratorium, a view supported by the Americans, who continued their own program. Nonetheless, Maralinga was ordered to suspend all testing, including minor trials. It was feared that the term \"minor trial\" might connote that they were small nuclear explosions. This name lasted only until December 1959 before it was changed again to the \"Maralinga Experimental Programme\", as the term \"test\" was still considered to be too evocative of a nuclear test.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nAlthough the major tests were carried out with publicity, the minor trials were more secretive,<ref name=\"keane\">{{cite news  |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/11/1052280486255.html |first=John |last=Keane |title=Maralinga's afterlife |newspaper=The Age |date=11 May 2003 |access-date=2 December 2008}}</ref> especially after 1958, as the British government wished to avoid publicity during the talks in Geneva that led to the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=222\u2013223}} The minor trials were planned and carried out by the UK authorities with little or no Australian involvement other than logistical support. The UK government submitted proposals for trials to the AWTSC, but its role was limited to advising the Australian government whether to approve a series of tests; unlike the major tests it had no right to veto a specific minor trial. After 1960, proposals also had to be referred to Martin in his role as the Australian Defence Scientific Advisor. Radiological safety was the responsibility of the AHPR.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=395}} Ultimately, the minor trials had far greater long-term environmental impact than the major tests, although these effects were limited to the range areas.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=234}}\n\n===Kittens===\nNuclear weapons use a [[neutron initiator]], a neutron source capable of producing a burst of neutrons in order to \"kick-start\" the [[nuclear chain reaction]] at the optimal moment. These worked by mixing [[polonium-210]] and beryllium.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Polonium-210 is an [[alpha particle]] emitter with a half-life of 138 days.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}} Alpha particles from the polonium caused the beryllium to emit neutrons. The Kitten trials were experiments conducted as part of the development of the neutron initiators.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Five tests were conducted at the K site at Emu Field, about {{convert|8|mi|order=flip}} from the Operation Totem test site on 26 and 30 September and 6, 14 and 17 October 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} These experiments dispersed about {{convert|36|g}} of beryllium and {{convert|407|Ci}} of polonium-210 into the surrounding area.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}} Most of the contamination was within a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} radius, with some debris being thrown up to {{convert|400|yd|order=flip}} away. All contamination was within the restricted area.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}\n\n[[File:Kittens and Tim Operation - 43 Mile Camp - Instrumentation.jpg|thumb|left|Kittens and Tim Operation \u2013 43 Mile Camp \u2013 Instrumentation]]\nFrom these tests an improved initiator design emerged that was smaller and simpler, which the scientists were eager to test it. A site in the UK would save time and money, although [[Omond Solandt]] raised the possibility of using one in [[Alberta]] in Canada.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Consideration was given to using the [[MoD Shoeburyness|range]] on [[Foulness Island]], which was used by the AWRE for testing conventional explosive components of nuclear weapons, but on 7 April 1954 the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] informed the [[House of Lords]] that at Foulness, \"no nuclear explosions have been or will be made, nor will experiments be made with fission products or any other hazardous radioactive material.\"{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=404}} While no experiments were carried out at Foulness with radioactive material, experiments were conducted with explosives and beryllium in 1962 and 1963.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=402}}\n\nAn alternative considered was [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] in Scotland. Contamination there could be blown out to sea, but the site was otherwise far from ideal. The weather there was generally wet, and the high humidity would interfere with experimental apparatus. Moreover, although downwind contamination would be acceptable, the local authorities could not be reassured that it would be zero.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Lieutenant Colonel K. Stewart noted that \"I doubt if the people owning the estates in Scotland would look on that with very great favour. They are interested in pheasants and deer in Scotland.\"{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=405}} The dry weather and isolation of Maralinga provided a better option.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}\n\nThe December 1952 [[aide-m\u00e9moire]] covering Operation Totem made no mention of minor trials,{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=405}} and they came to the notice of Australian authorities only when  Australian assistance was requested in preparing the site,{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=505\u2013506}} but Australian concurrence was sought for all subsequent trials.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=405}} The Wilson mission requested that in addition to conducting major atomic tests, the UK could conduct a series of Kittens as part of Operation Buffalo.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=121\u2013123}}{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=102\u2013103}} The Australians asked for details, and in response Aldermaston provided a comprehensive report on ''The Scope and Radiological Hazards of Kittens'' in February 1955. This was referred to Martin for comment. He could see no issues with the proposed tests,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=292\u2013293}} and they were approved by the AWTSC. A Kitten test site was established at Naya, east of the main Maralinga range.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=219}} A public announcement of the Kitten trials was issued in the UK on 25 February 1955 and in Australia the following day.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=508\u2013509}}\n\n[[File:Kittens and Tim Operation - 43 Mile Camp - Trials area.jpg|thumb|Kittens and Tim Operation \u2013 43 Mile Camp \u2013 Trials area]]Six Kitten tests were carried out at Naya in March 1956. Thereafter, they became a regular part of the testing program,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=219}} with 21 more tests carried out in 1957,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=220}} 20 in 1959,{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=496}} and 47 in 1960 and 1961, after which they were discontinued owing to the development of external neutron generators.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=219}} Kitten experiments at Naya dispersed {{convert|7004|Ci}} of polonium-210, {{convert|750|g}} of beryllium and {{convert|120|kg}} of natural and depleted uranium.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}}\n\n===Tims===\nTim experiments were concerned with the measurement of how the core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the shock wave of the high explosive component. The passage of the shock wave through the assembly was measured and recorded using detectors and high-speed photography. Tim tests used real nuclear weapon assemblies, but cores of natural or depleted uranium, which is chemically identical to [[highly enriched uranium]] but not [[fissile]], and only feebly radioactive. They took place from 1955 to 1963, and involved 321 trials with uranium and beryllium tampers at the Naya and Kuli areas at Maralinga. Twelve of the Tim tests at the TM100 and TM101 areas involved studies of plutonium compression. These experiments used and dispersed {{convert|77|kg}} of beryllium, {{convert|825|kg}} of natural uranium, {{convert|6800|kg}} of uranium-238 and  about 1.2&nbsp;kg of plutonium about the test sites.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=216}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}}\n\n===Rats===\nRat trials also investigated the properties of shock waves. They had the same objectives as the Tims, and differed only in the way that measurements were carried out. Instead of using external sensors, the Rats employed an intense but short-lived [[gamma ray]] source the size of a pea that was placed inside the assembly. X-ray detectors gave a picture of the progress of the explosion from the inside. Between 1956 and 1960, 125 Rat trials took place at the Naya and Dobo areas at Maralinga. The Rat tests used {{convert|180|kg}} of [[uranium-238]]; {{convert|2160|Ci}} of [[scandium-46]], a beta and gamma emitter with a radioactive [[half-life]] of 83.8 days; {{convert|400|Ci}} of polonium-210, with a half-life of 138 days; and {{convert|120|Ci}} of lead-212, a beta emitter with a half-life of 10.6 hours. With such short lifetimes, these soon decayed away to negligible amounts.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=216}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}}\n\n===Vixens===\nVixen trials involved safety testing. They were about assuring that the core of a nuclear weapon would not accidentally undergo criticality in the event of a fire or unintended crash. These were messy, for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. These tests sometimes involved some yield from fission, but in every case this was less than the yield from the weapon's conventional explosive component.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}} The British government's position was that so long as the nuclear explosion component was less than {{convert|10|tTNT}} there was no violation of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was then under discussion, but no such limit was agreed upon.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=410}} While the AWTSC could determine whether there were public health and safety issues with a test, it could not assess whether there were political issues.

Balloons were used to carry instruments aloft and take samples. There were three types of Vixen A experiments: combustion in a petrol fire; combustion in an electric furnace; and dispersion by detonation of a nuclear bomb's high explosive components. The petrol fire tests were conducted using a chimney {{convert|11|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} tall on a {{convert|4|by|4|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} base, and generated temperatures ranging from {{convert|800|to|1200|C}} for uranium and beryllium and {{convert|600|to|1000|C}} for plutonium.

It is dangerous when it enters the body, in the worst case by breathing and lodging in the lungs, and therefore tiny particles, often the result of such explosion testing, are the worst threat.  The extreme biological persistence of plutonium's [[radioactive contamination]] and the cancer threat posed by alpha radiation occurring internally together establish plutonium's dangers.{{sfn|Kaku|Trainer|1983|p=77}}\n\nDuring the Operation Antler trials, the British government had given the AWTSC reassurances that safety measures were in place to prevent balloons from breaking loose. Despite this, two balloons broke free during a [[squall]] on 22 July 1959. One was subsequently recovered but the other was not. A board of inquiry was held,{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=502\u2013503}} but an even more embarrassing incident occurred on the night of 23/24 September 1960, when seven of the eight balloons being readied for experiments broke free of their moorings during a thunderstorm. Five were recovered on the range on 27 September, but two were lost and drifted further afield, one being recovered near [[Cobar]] in New South Wales on 24 September and the other around [[Hungerford, Queensland|Hungerford]] in New South Wales, which was not located until 1 October. Titterton wrote a critical letter to the AWRE. It was clear that the procedures for prevent balloon escapes had been inadequate and the self-destruction devices were unreliable.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=516}}{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=227}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=413}}\n\n===Fallout===\nIn the late 1950s, [[Hedley Marston]]'s research into [[nuclear fallout]] from the Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the AWTSC, resulting in one of the more memorable feuds in Australian science.{{sfn|Sherratt|2002|pp=209\u2013210}} Marston was the head of the Division of Biology and General Nutrition at the [[CSIRO]], and was commissioned by the AWTSC to study the concentrations of [[iodine-131]] in the thyroids of sheep and cattle. A 1954 American report assessed that there was no public health danger, but the AWTSC wanted to be able to monitor the Australian situation. Surveys started before the tests at Maralinga commenced in order to establish a baseline. Marston's results indicated a rise in iodine-131 due to Operation Mosaic. It was not enough to pose a public health hazard\u2014his results indicated that the concentration was about 1 per cent of the acceptable limit\u2014but it did indicate that fallout was more widespread than first thought. . He then attempted to extrapolate his results to [[strontium-90]], but a valid assessment could not be made in this way, and was therefore no more than speculation. In 1961 the AWTSC published a study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. It did find an increase in strontium-90 in Australia, but it was a quarter of that recorded in the UK. Although the 1958 Operation Grapple thermonuclear tests had a measurable effect in the UK, none was detected in Australia.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=204\u2013208}}{{sfn|Bryant|Dwyer|Stevens|Titterton|1961|pp=754\u2013757}}\n\n==Closure==\nMaralinga was conceived as a testing ground where major tests could be conducted annually, but this did not occur, and Operation Antler was the last major test series conducted there. One reason was public sentiment. A 1952 poll indicated that 58 per cent of Australians supported British nuclear testing in Australia, with only 29 per cent against, but support steadily declined, and by 1957 only 37 per cent were in favour, with 49 per cent opposed. This augured poorly for the future of Maralinga, if there was a change of government, and the [[1961 Australian federal election]] reduced Menzies' majority to just one seat. The decline in Australian support for testing was part of a worldwide trend that resulted in the moratorium on nuclear testing from November 1958 to September 1961.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}}\n\nMaralinga was now redundant, as the Australian government's restriction on testing thermonuclear weapons had led to the development of the Christmas Island test site, where there was no such restriction, and its favourable winds carried fallout away. With the [[1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement]], Britain also gained access to the Nevada Test Site,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}} where the first British major test took place underground on 1 March 1962,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awe.co.uk/main_site/about_awe/history/timeline/1962/ |title=UK Mounts First Underground Nuclear Test (UGT) |publisher=Atomic Weapons Establishment |access-date=15 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118030522/http://www.awe.co.uk/main_site/about_awe/history/timeline/1962/ |archive-date=18 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> but there was no certainty that Nevada would be available in the future. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty banned atmospheric testing, and no site was located at the Maralinga Range for underground testing; the nearest suitable site was on Aboriginal land {{convert|250|mi|order=flip}} away. After 1963, Maralinga was placed on caretaker status, and although there was some discussion about conducting minor trials in 1966, in view of the fact that the 1956 Memorandum of Arrangements was due to expire in March of that year, the British government decided that it would not seek to extend or renew the agreement.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}} A formal memorandum on the termination of the 1956 Memorandum of Arrangements was signed on 23 September 1967, and the UK was released from most liabilities and responsibilities on 21 December 1967.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}} In December 1968, the Minister for Defence revoked the declaration of Maralinga as a prohibited area under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952.{{sfn|Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee|2002|p=15}} On 31 August 1972, the Minister for Supply removed the restrictions on most of the Maralinga Prohibited Area, retaining only a {{convert|48|by|240|km|adj=on}} strip that became part of the new Woomera Prohibited Area.{{sfn|Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee|2002|p=33}}\n\n==Legacy==\nClean up operations commenced at Maralinga with Operation Clean Up in 1963 and Operation Hercules in 1964. These involved the removal of major hazards to permit entry to the test sites. A major clean up operation codenamed Operation Brumby was conducted in 1967. Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil. Highly contaminated soil from Wewak was buried in the Marcoo crater, and the debris pits were capped. Over time, the short-lived isotopes decayed away, leaving plutonium, with its half-life of 24,100 years, as the main radioactive hazard.{{sfn|Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee|2002|pp=12\u201316}} In January 1979, the British government agreed to the \"repatriation\" of recoverable plutonium that had been buried at Maralinga.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110914877 |title=Killen must explain Maralinga: Scholes |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=53 |issue=15,722 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=8 October 1978 |accessdate=30 November 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Souvenir necktie for staff of the maralinga atomic test facility.jpg|thumb|right|Souvenir necktie for staff of Maralinga]]\nIn 1984, the [[Minister for Resources and Energy]] established the Kerr Committee on 15 May 1984 to review fallout from the British nuclear tests in Australia.

A total of seven [[nuclear test]]s were performed, with [[Nuclear weapon yield|approximate yields]] ranging from {{convert|1|to|27|ktTNT|lk=on|sigfig=1}}. Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site: Operation Buffalo in 1956 and Operation Antler the following year. Operation Buffalo consisted of four tests; One Tree ({{convert|12.9|ktTNT}}) and Breakaway ({{convert|10.8|ktTNT}}) were detonated on towers, Marcoo  ({{convert|1.4|ktTNT}}) at ground level, and the Kite ({{convert|2.9|ktTNT}}) was released by a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Vickers Valiant]] bomber from a height of {{convert|35,000|ft|order=flip}}. This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft.\n\nOperation Buffalo was followed by Operation Antler in 1957, which tested new, light-weight nuclear weapons. Three tests were conducted in this series: Tadje ({{convert|0.93|ktTNT}}, Biak {{convert|5.67|ktTNT}}and Taranak {{convert|26.6|ktTNT}}. The first two were conducted from towers, while the last was suspended from balloons. Tadje used [[cobalt]] pellets as a tracer for determining yield, resulting in rumours that Britain was developing a [[cobalt bomb]]. Between 1956 and 1963, the Maralinga site was also used for minor trials, tests of nuclear weapons components not involving nuclear explosions. Kittens were trials of [[neutron initiator]]s; Rats and Tims measured how the [[fissile]] [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the high explosive shock wave; and Vixens investigated the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons. Ultimately, the minor trials generated more contamination than the major tests.\n\nThe site was left contaminated with [[radioactive waste]], and an initial clean up was attempted in 1967. The [[McClelland Royal Commission]], an examination of the effects of the minor trials and major tests, delivered its report in 1985, and found that significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga sites.  It recommended another clean up, which was completed in 2000 at a cost of [[AUD]] $108 million. Debate continued over the safety of the site and the long-term health effects on the traditional [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] custodians of the land and former personnel. In 1994, the Australian government paid compensation amounting to $13.5 million to the traditional owners, the [[Maralinga Tjarutja]] people. Their land was fully restored to them in 2014.\n\nBy the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some journalists investigated the subject and political scrutiny became more intense. Journalist [[Brian Toohey]] ran a series of stories in the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission. In June 1993, ''[[New Scientist]]'' journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article titled \"Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga\" and several related articles. In 2007, ''[[Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up]]'' by [[Alan Parkinson (engineer)|Alan Parkinson]] documented the unsuccessful clean-up at Maralinga. Popular songs about the Maralinga story have been written by [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] and [[Midnight Oil]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring the early part of the [[Second World War]], Britain had a [[nuclear weapon]]s project, code-named [[Tube Alloys]],{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}} which the 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] merged with the American [[Manhattan Project]] to create a combined American, British, and Canadian project. The British government expected that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, after the war, but the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act) ended technical co-operation.{{sfn|Jones|2017|pp=1\u20132}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} under the cover name \"[[High Explosive Research]]\".{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=24, 48, 57}}\n\n[[File:United Kingdom Minister for Defence, Mr Duncan Sandys on a tour of Australia.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Minister of Defence (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Minister of Defence]], [[Duncan Sandys]] (centre) meets with [[Howard Beale (politician)|Howard Beale]] (right), the Australian [[Department of Supply|Minister for Supply]] in August 1957.]]\nAt the time Britain was still Australia's largest trading partner, although it was overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. Britain and Australia still had strong cultural ties, and the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Robert Menzies]], who came to office in 1949, was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, mainly because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting together in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Malayan Emergency]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=20\u201321}} Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing British forces in the Middle East and Far East.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=82\u201385}}\n\nThe Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on both [[nuclear power]] and nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=21\u201322}} and was particularly interested in developing the former, as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=21\u201322}} Plans for nuclear power were considered along with [[hydroelectricity]] as part of the post-war [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]],{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=147}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=54, 122\u2013128}}  but the 1948 ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'', to which Australia was not a party, cut Australian scientists off from technical information to which they formerly had access.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=109\u2013111}} Britain would not share it with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise the far more important relationship with the United States,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=21}} and the Americans were reluctant to do so after the [[Venona project]] revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=92\u201393}} The creation of [[NATO]] in 1949 excluded Australia from the Western Alliance.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|p=166}}\n\nOn 3 October 1952 the United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon in [[Operation Hurricane]] in the [[Montebello Islands]] off the coast of [[Western Australia]].{{sfn|Jones|2017|p=25}} A year later the first nuclear tests on the Australian mainland were carried out in [[Operation Totem]] at [[Emu Field]] in the [[Great Victoria Desert]] in [[South Australia]], with a detonation on 15 October and a second two weeks later on 27 October.<ref name=\"modkey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/470D247F-7615-460C-9829-DDAF99F88D39/0/Key_Events.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/470D247F-7615-460C-9829-DDAF99F88D39/0/Key_Events.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 October 2012 |title=Key events in the UK atmospheric nuclear test programme |publisher=UK Ministry of Defence |accessdate=27 June 2009 }}</ref> The Australian [[Department of Supply|Minister for Supply]], [[Howard Beale (politician)|Howard Beale]], stated in 1955 that \"England has the know how; we have the open spaces, much technical skill and a great willingness to help the Motherland.

In May 1953, the UK [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] were advised that one was needed. They delegated the task of finding one to [[Air Marshal]] Sir [[Thomas Elmhirst]],{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=87}}  the chairman of the Totem Executive (Totex), which had been formed in the UK to coordinate the Operation Totem tests.{{sfn|McClelland|1985a|p=139}} He wrote to [[J.

On the other hand, it was recognised that Australian participation would likely mean that the Australians would demand access to even more information than in Operation Totem. This had implications for Britain's relationship with the United States. Sharing information with the Australians would make it much harder to secure Britain's ultimate goal, of restoring the wartime nuclear [[Special Relationship]] with the United States, and gaining access to information pertaining to the design and manufacture of US nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Temporary Access Road - Watson - Tietkens Well.jpg|thumb|Cutting a temporary access road from Watson to Tietkens Well]]\nA railhead and a quarry were established at [[Watson, South Australia|Watson]], about {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip}} west of Ooldea, and Beadell's bush track from Watson to Emu became the main line communications for the project.

The work was carried out by the Kwinana Construction Group (KCG) under a [[cost-plus contract]]. It had just finished the construction of an oil refinery near [[Fremantle]], and it was hoped that it could move on to the new venture immediately, but the delay in obtaining Cabinet's approval meant that work could not start until mid-1955, by which time most of its work force had dispersed. This caused a cascading series of delays.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=473}} Assembling a labour force of 1,000 from scratch in such a remote location proved difficult, even when KCG was offering wages as high as AU \u00a340 a week ({{Inflation|AU|80|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=AUD$}}).{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=474}}\n\nThe Australian government elected to create a tri-service task force to construct the test installations. The Australian Army's Engineer in Chief, [[Brigadier]] [[Ronald McNicoll]] designated Major [[Owen Magee]], the Commander, [[Royal Australian Engineers]], [[Western Command (Australia)|Western Command]], to lead this task force. He joined a party headed by [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] John Blomfield, the UKMOS Atomic Weapons representative in Australia, on a site inspection, and then flew to the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE) at [[Aldermaston]] in the UK in a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Handley Page Hastings]] to review the plans. These were still incomplete, but it gave Magee sufficient information to prepare estimates of the labour and equipment that would be required.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=474}} The job involved the erection of towers, siting of instrument mounts, grading of {{convert|190|mi|order=flip}} of tracks, laying control cables and power lines, and construction of bunkers and other facilities dispersed over an area of {{convert|80|mi2|km2|order=flip}} but sited to within an accuracy of {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip}}. The work force could not be fully assembled before 1 March, but the facilities had to be ready for use by the end of July.{{sfn|Greville|2002|p=475}} Magee prepared Blomfield a list of stores and equipment.

The trenches were dug by a cable plough towed by a [[Caterpillar D8]] tractor. In some cases the limestone was too hard for the plough and the cable was buried by using a grader to cover the cable to the required depth. A similar procedure was followed for laying {{convert|8000|ft|order=flip}} of power cable. Some 1,300 scaffold frames were erected for mounting instrumentation, held in place by 33,000 anchor pipes. Bunkers ranging in size up to {{convert|1600|cuft|order=flip}} were excavated with explosives and a {{convert|350|cuft/min|adj=on|-1|order=flip}} compressor mounted on a four-wheel drive 3-ton Bedford truck connected to the jackhammer part of the 4-inch wagon drill. Explosives were in the form of {{convert|5|lb|adj=on|order=flip}} tubes of Geofex left over from a [[Bureau of Mineral Resources]] seismic survey of the area. The bunker work proceeded so well that the task force was able to assist KCG with its pit excavation work. Some instrument bunkers contained {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|order=flip|sigfig=1}} steel cubes. Getting them into the holes was tricky because they weighed {{convert|30|LT|t LT ST|order=out}}, and the largest available crane was a {{convert|25|LT|t LT ST|adj=on|order=out}} Coles crane. They were manoeuvred into place with the assistance of a TD 24 bulldozer. The Coles crane was also used to erect the two {{convert|100|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} shot towers. Concrete was made ''in situ'', using local quarry dust, limestone and bore water. The Canadians erected metal sheds of a commercial design, which were used to assess blast damage.

In June, the range commander ordered the surveyors to return to Adelaide, which would have brought the work at Maralinga to a halt. Magee went over his head and appealed to the commander of [[4th Military District (Australia)|Central Command]], [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Arthur Gillespie Wilson|Arthur Wilson]], who flew up from Adelaide and sacked the range commander. Impressed by what he saw at Maralinga, Wilson arranged for the task force to receive a special Maralinga allowance of 16 [[Australian shilling]]s per day ({{Inflation|AU|1.6|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=AUD$}}), and additional leave of two days per month. The British government added a generous meal allowance of [[GBP]] \u00a31 ({{Inflation|AU|3.2|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=AUD$}}) per day, resulting in a diet of steak, ham, turkey, oysters and crayfish. In June, Beale flew in two planeloads of journalists, including [[Chapman Pincher]] and [[Hugh Buggy]] for a press conference. The task force completed all its work on 29 July, two days ahead of schedule, although KCG still had a few remaining tasks.{{sfn|Greville|2002|pp=480\u2013481}}\nBy 1959, the Maralinga village would have accommodation for 750 people, with catering facilities that could cope with up to 1,600.

For this he employed three strategies. The first was to remove the incentive to go there. An important lure was the availability of rations at Ooldea and surrounding missions, so he had them closed. The Ooldea mission was closed in June 1952, and the reserve was revoked in February 1954. The inhabitants were moved to a new settlement at [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]], but many ritual objects had been concealed and left behind, and the people preferred the landscape of the desert, and many people left Yalata to return to their traditional lands. A more successful tactic was to frighten them. The desert was said to be inhabited by [[Rainbow Serpent|wanampi]], dangerous rainbow serpent spirits that lived in blowholes in the area. The noise of the nuclear tests was attributed to wanampi, as were the dangers of radiation.{{sfn|Brady|1999|pp=5\u20138}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131712516 |title=Wanampi |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=52 |issue=14,996 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=28 January 1978 |accessdate=3 December 2019 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> A complicating factor was the decision to establish the [[Giles Weather Station]] in the [[Rawlinson Ranges]]. This was outside MacDougall's jurisdiction, being just across the border in Western Australia, and the people there had little contact with white people.

It was initially scheduled for April and May 1956, but was pushed back to September and October, when meteorological conditions were most favourable. Ultimately all tests on the Australian mainland were conducted at this time of year. The 1954 plan for Operation Theta called for four tests, each with a different purpose.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe UK's first nuclear weapon, [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]], was large and cumbersome, being {{convert|24|ft|order=flip}} long and {{convert|5|ft|order=flip}} wide, and weighed {{convert|10000|lb|order=flip}}, so only the Royal Air Force (RAF) [[V-bombers]] could carry it.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}  In November 1953, the RAF and [[Royal Navy]] issued an [[List of Operational Requirements for nuclear weapons|Operational Requirement]], OR.1127, for a smaller, lighter weapon with similar yield that could be carried by tactical aircraft.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=81}} A second requirement for a light-weight bomb arose with the British government's decision in July 1954 to proceed with a [[British hydrogen bomb programme]].{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=53\u201357}} Hydrogen bombs required an atomic bomb as a primary, and one was incorporated in the British hydrogen bomb design, known as [[Green Granite]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nIn response, Aldermaston developed a new warhead called [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard]] that was half the size of Blue Danube and weighed one-fifth as much, mainly through innovation in the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] design, principally the use of an \"air lens\".{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}} Instead of the core being immediately inside the tamper, there was an air gap between them, with the core suspended on thin wires. This allowed the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The concept had been developed by the Manhattan Project in 1945 and 1946, and permitted a reduction in both the size of the core and the amount of explosives required to compress it.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=199\u2013201}}\n\nThe first test on the agenda was therefore of the new Red Beard design. OR.1127 also specified a requirement for the device to have variable yields, which Aldermaston attempted to achieve through the addition of small amounts of thermonuclear material, a process known as \"boosting\". A {{convert|300|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} tower was built at Maralinga for a boosted weapon test, in case sufficient [[lithium deuteride]] could not be produced in time for the Operation Mosaic G2 test. In the event, it was available, and G2 went ahead as scheduled. Various tests of the effects of nuclear weapons were considered, but only one thought to be worth the effort was a test of a ground burst. These were known to produce more fallout and less effect than air bursts, and had therefore been avoided by the Americans, but such a test might produce useful information that the UK might trade with them. A ground test was therefore included in the schedule. A fourth test was an operational test. While the physics package of Blue Danube had been tested, there had been no test of the device in its operational form, so one was included in the Operation Buffalo program.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nThe interdepartmental Atomic Trials Executive in London, chaired by [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[Frederick E.

Once again the politicians arrived but returned disappointed. This put Penney under great pressure. On the one hand, if Maralinga was to be used for many years then riding roughshod over Australian concerns about safety at an early date was inadvisable; on the other, there was the urgent need to test Red Beard in time for the upcoming [[Operation Grapple]], the test of a British hydrogen bomb. Which was more important was the subject of debate in the UK between [[Willis Jackson, Baron Jackson of Burnley|Willis Jackson]], who argued for Maralinga, and [[William Richard Joseph Cook|Bill Cook]], who argued for Grapple.

In the hope that sharing the results might lead to fuller cooperation, the test had been discussed with the Americans by the [[British Joint Staff Mission]] in Washington, DC, and they had been sufficiently interested to offer the use of American instrumentation and personnel. Fearful of giving away too much information, the British accepted the instrumentation only. The weapon was lowered into a concrete pit.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=160\u2013162}} This time the weather was good, but the aircraft bringing Beale and the politicians was delayed by fog in Canberra.

By mid-June 1957, they included up to seven tests: of a surface-to-air warhead called Blue Fox, a small warhead called Pixie, four different versions of Red Beard, and a round designed to test the principle of radiation implosion. Initially it was planned to test Blue Fox (later renamed Indigo Hammer) in both boosted and unboosted form, but the disappointing results of boosting thus far meant that the benefit of boosting would be too small to warrant it, and this version was discarded. Pixie was an even smaller, lightweight ({{convert|250|lb|adj=on|order=flip}}) warhead with a [[plutonium]] core under consideration for use with the Royal Navy's [[Seaslug missile]]. Its drawback was that it required enough plutonium to build two Red Beards, and plutonium was scarce and expensive.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=183\u2013186}} In February 1957, the Australian authorities were notified of plans for six tests, including three using balloons, with maximum yields of up to {{convert|80|ktTNT}}.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=500}}\n\nThe UK had considerable experience with [[barrage balloon]]s during the Second World War but the proposed use of balloons to carry warheads to a higher altitude than achievable with a tower was an innovation for Operation Antler. Use of balloons did away with the engineering effort to build towers, and allowed a test site to be re-used, saving on the effort to construct instrumentation sites and lay cables. Most importantly, whereas low-level detonations sucked up contaminated radioactive dirt from the ground and the vaporised tower, a high-altitude detonation created fallout only from the bomb itself, and were therefore much cleaner.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=176, 190}} While accepting this point, the AWTSC was apprehensive about the consequences of a runaway balloon carrying a live atomic bomb.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=440}} Bill Saxby and J. T. Tomblin from Aldermaston and an RAF balloon expert visited the Nevada Test Site to observe the work Americans were doing with balloons, and it was suggested that Titterton should also visit Nevada.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=178}} Safety procedures were developed that included, in an extreme circumstance, shooting down the balloons. Titterton and Beale then accepted the use of balloons.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=195}}\n\nIn July 1957, the Australian government was informed of the UK authorities' decision to limit Operation Antler to just three tests. There would be two tower tests of {{convert|1.5|ktTNT}} and {{convert|3|ktTNT}}, codenamed Tadje and Biak respectively, and only one balloon test, a {{convert|20|ktTNT|adj=on}} test codenamed Taranaki.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=441}} Helping the Pixie test (which became known as Tadje) remain on the schedule was the deletion of Red Beard tests. It was decided that the third test would be of a Red Beard with a composite core of uranium-plutonium core, which had not yet been tested, while the pure plutonium Red Beard would go into production without further testing.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=183\u2013186}}\n\n[[File:Atomic test site at Maralinga - Workshops.jpg|thumb|right|Atomic test site at Maralinga \u2013 Workshops]]\nCharles Adams was appointed the test director, with J.

These were capable of bearing loads of up to {{convert|9000|lb|order=flip|-3}} in winds of up to {{convert|30|kn|km/h|-1|order=flip}}, but three were required to lift a bomb aloft instead of two. Field trials were held at [[RAF Cardington]] in [[Bedfordshire]] in February 1957. Twelve were shipped to Maralinga, but inflated balloons were not kept in hangars as they had been at Cardington, but moored in the open. On 4 September a storm struck Maralinga, with lightning and wind gusts of up to {{convert|40|kn|km/h|-1|order=flip}}, and three balloons were ignited and completely destroyed. Adams requested that another balloon and spare rigging be despatched from the UK.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=197}}\n\nTaranaki was tentatively scheduled for 7 October, but high upper-level winds caused a postponement. It was eventually decided to fire at 16:15 on 9 October. The yield was around {{convert|26.6|ktTNT}}, somewhat higher than expected, but the cloud rose to {{convert|23000|ft|order=flip}} with a secondary cloud forming at {{convert|10000|ft|order=flip}}, which was much lower than the {{convert|28300|ft|order=flip}} expected.  Since the Australian government had not set limits on fallout, the AWTSC accepted the recommendations of the NRAC. The result was that the permissible limits were double that of those set for the Operation Buffalo tests. As a result of the balloon detonation, the fireball did not touch the ground, and fallout was limited in both volume and extent.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985a|pp=356\u2013357}} The use of balloons was thus revealed to be far more difficult than anticipated, but the anticipated advantages were realised, and balloons would subsequently be used successfully in the Operation Grapple tests on [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=197}}\n{{-}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: center;\"\n |+ United Kingdom's Antler series tests and detonations\n |-\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Name\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Date + time ([[Universal Time|UTC]])\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Local time zone\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |[[List of nuclear test sites|Location]]\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Elevation + height\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Delivery\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Purpose\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" |[[List of nuclear weapons|Device]]\n !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |[[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]]\n !style=\"background:#efefef;\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n |-\n !

These experiments were  [[subcritical testing|subcritical tests]] involving testing of nuclear weapons or their components, but not nuclear explosions. The four series of minor trials were codenamed Kittens, Tims, Rats and Vixens, and involved experiments with plutonium, uranium, [[polonium]] and [[beryllium]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=215}} They were called \"Minor Trials\" until October 1958, when they were renamed \"Assessment Tests\"{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=395}} The name change were made in the wake of the international moratorium on nuclear testing, which began on 31 October 1958. The position of the British government was that the minor trials were not covered by the moratorium, a view supported by the Americans, who continued their own program. Nonetheless, Maralinga was ordered to suspend all testing, including minor trials. It was feared that the term \"minor trial\" might connote that they were small nuclear explosions. This name lasted only until December 1959 before it was changed again to the \"Maralinga Experimental Programme\", as the term \"test\" was still considered to be too evocative of a nuclear test.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nAlthough the major tests were carried out with publicity, the minor trials were more secretive,<ref name=\"keane\">{{cite news  |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/11/1052280486255.html |first=John |last=Keane |title=Maralinga's afterlife |newspaper=The Age |date=11 May 2003 |access-date=2 December 2008}}</ref> especially after 1958, as the British government wished to avoid publicity during the talks in Geneva that led to the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=222\u2013223}} The minor trials were planned and carried out by the UK authorities with little or no Australian involvement other than logistical support. The UK government submitted proposals for trials to the AWTSC, but its role was limited to advising the Australian government whether to approve a series of tests; unlike the major tests it had no right to veto a specific minor trial. After 1960, proposals also had to be referred to Martin in his role as the Australian Defence Scientific Advisor. Radiological safety was the responsibility of the AHPR.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=395}} Ultimately, the minor trials had far greater long-term environmental impact than the major tests, although these effects were limited to the range areas.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=234}}\n\n===Kittens===\nNuclear weapons use a [[neutron initiator]], a neutron source capable of producing a burst of neutrons in order to \"kick-start\" the [[nuclear chain reaction]] at the optimal moment. These worked by mixing [[polonium-210]] and beryllium.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Polonium-210 is an [[alpha particle]] emitter with a half-life of 138 days.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}} Alpha particles from the polonium caused the beryllium to emit neutrons. The Kitten trials were experiments conducted as part of the development of the neutron initiators.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Five tests were conducted at the K site at Emu Field, about {{convert|8|mi|order=flip}} from the Operation Totem test site on 26 and 30 September and 6, 14 and 17 October 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} These experiments dispersed about {{convert|36|g}} of beryllium and {{convert|407|Ci}} of polonium-210 into the surrounding area.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}} Most of the contamination was within a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} radius, with some debris being thrown up to {{convert|400|yd|order=flip}} away. All contamination was within the restricted area.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}\n\n[[File:Kittens and Tim Operation - 43 Mile Camp - Instrumentation.jpg|thumb|left|Kittens and Tim Operation \u2013 43 Mile Camp \u2013 Instrumentation]]\nFrom these tests an improved initiator design emerged that was smaller and simpler, which the scientists were eager to test it. A site in the UK would save time and money, although [[Omond Solandt]] raised the possibility of using one in [[Alberta]] in Canada.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Consideration was given to using the [[MoD Shoeburyness|range]] on [[Foulness Island]], which was used by the AWRE for testing conventional explosive components of nuclear weapons, but on 7 April 1954 the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] informed the [[House of Lords]] that at Foulness, \"no nuclear explosions have been or will be made, nor will experiments be made with fission products or any other hazardous radioactive material.\"{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=404}} While no experiments were carried out at Foulness with radioactive material, experiments were conducted with explosives and beryllium in 1962 and 1963.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=402}}\n\nAn alternative considered was [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] in Scotland. Contamination there could be blown out to sea, but the site was otherwise far from ideal. The weather there was generally wet, and the high humidity would interfere with experimental apparatus. Moreover, although downwind contamination would be acceptable, the local authorities could not be reassured that it would be zero.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}} Lieutenant Colonel K. Stewart noted that \"I doubt if the people owning the estates in Scotland would look on that with very great favour. They are interested in pheasants and deer in Scotland.\"{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=405}} The dry weather and isolation of Maralinga provided a better option.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}\n\nThe December 1952 [[aide-m\u00e9moire]] covering Operation Totem made no mention of minor trials,{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=405}} and they came to the notice of Australian authorities only when  Australian assistance was requested in preparing the site,{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=505\u2013506}} but Australian concurrence was sought for all subsequent trials.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=405}} The Wilson mission requested that in addition to conducting major atomic tests, the UK could conduct a series of Kittens as part of Operation Buffalo.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=121\u2013123}}{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=102\u2013103}} The Australians asked for details, and in response Aldermaston provided a comprehensive report on ''The Scope and Radiological Hazards of Kittens'' in February 1955. This was referred to Martin for comment. He could see no issues with the proposed tests,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=292\u2013293}} and they were approved by the AWTSC. A Kitten test site was established at Naya, east of the main Maralinga range.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=219}} A public announcement of the Kitten trials was issued in the UK on 25 February 1955 and in Australia the following day.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=508\u2013509}}\n\n[[File:Kittens and Tim Operation - 43 Mile Camp - Trials area.jpg|thumb|Kittens and Tim Operation \u2013 43 Mile Camp \u2013 Trials area]]Six Kitten tests were carried out at Naya in March 1956. Thereafter, they became a regular part of the testing program,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=219}} with 21 more tests carried out in 1957,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=220}} 20 in 1959,{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=496}} and 47 in 1960 and 1961, after which they were discontinued owing to the development of external neutron generators.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=219}} Kitten experiments at Naya dispersed {{convert|7004|Ci}} of polonium-210, {{convert|750|g}} of beryllium and {{convert|120|kg}} of natural and depleted uranium.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}}\n\n===Tims===\nTim experiments were concerned with the measurement of how the core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the shock wave of the high explosive component. The passage of the shock wave through the assembly was measured and recorded using detectors and high-speed photography. Tim tests used real nuclear weapon assemblies, but cores of natural or depleted uranium, which is chemically identical to [[highly enriched uranium]] but not [[fissile]], and only feebly radioactive. They took place from 1955 to 1963, and involved 321 trials with uranium and beryllium tampers at the Naya and Kuli areas at Maralinga. Twelve of the Tim tests at the TM100 and TM101 areas involved studies of plutonium compression. These experiments used and dispersed {{convert|77|kg}} of beryllium, {{convert|825|kg}} of natural uranium, {{convert|6800|kg}} of uranium-238 and  about 1.2&nbsp;kg of plutonium about the test sites.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=216}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=396}}\n\n===Rats===\nRat trials also investigated the properties of shock waves. They had the same objectives as the Tims, and differed only in the way that measurements were carried out. Instead of using external sensors, the Rats employed an intense but short-lived [[gamma ray]] source the size of a pea that was placed inside the assembly. X-ray detectors gave a picture of the progress of the explosion from the inside. Between 1956 and 1960, 125 Rat trials took place at the Naya and Dobo areas at Maralinga. The Rat tests used {{convert|180|kg}} of [[uranium-238]]; {{convert|2160|Ci}} of [[scandium-46]], a beta and gamma emitter with a radioactive [[half-life]] of 83.8 days; {{convert|400|Ci}} of polonium-210, with a half-life of 138 days; and {{convert|120|Ci}} of lead-212, a beta emitter with a half-life of 10.6 hours. With such short lifetimes, these soon decayed away to negligible amounts.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=216}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}}\n\n===Vixens===\nVixen trials involved safety testing. They were about assuring that the core of a nuclear weapon would not accidentally undergo criticality in the event of a fire or unintended crash. These were messy, for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. These tests sometimes involved some yield from fission, but in every case this was less than the yield from the weapon's conventional explosive component.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}} The British government's position was that so long as the nuclear explosion component was less than {{convert|10|tTNT}} there was no violation of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was then under discussion, but no such limit was agreed upon.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=410}} While the AWTSC could determine whether there were public health and safety issues with a test, it could not assess whether there were political issues. However, after some consideration, the Australian government did approve the proposed Vixen test program.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=502\u2013503}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127210112 |title=Australia knew tests could contravene moratorium \u2013 Information delayed on Maralinga |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=59 |issue=18,195 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=24 July 1985 |access-date=30 November 2019 |page=17 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kittens and Tim Operation - 43 Mile Camp - Trials area - setting up instrumentation.jpg|thumb|left|Kittens and Tim Operation \u2013 43 Mile Camp \u2013 Trials area \u2013 setting up instrumentation]]\nSome 31 Vixen A trials were conducted in the Wewak area at Maralinga between 1959 and 1961 that investigated the effects of an accidental fire on a nuclear weapon, and involved a total of about {{convert|68|kg}} of natural and depleted uranium, 0.98&nbsp;kg of plutonium of which 0.58&nbsp;kg was dispersed, {{convert|99|Ci}} of polonium-210 and {{convert|1.96|Ci}} of [[actinium-227]]. Balloons were used to carry instruments aloft and take samples. There were three types of Vixen A experiments: combustion in a petrol fire; combustion in an electric furnace; and dispersion by detonation of a nuclear bomb's high explosive components. The petrol fire tests were conducted using a chimney {{convert|11|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} tall on a {{convert|4|by|4|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} base, and generated temperatures ranging from {{convert|800|to|1200|C}} for uranium and beryllium and {{convert|600|to|1000|C}} for plutonium. The electric furnace tests were only used for tests with uranium, and involved temperatures ranging from {{convert|600|to|800|C}}.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}}\n\nThe Vixen B experimental tests used explosives to blow up nuclear warheads containing plutonium to simulate what would happen in an air crash. In total, twelve Vixen B were conducted at the Taranaki site in 1960, 1961 and 1963, resulting in it becoming the most contaminated site at Maralinga. The tests were conducted on steel structures known as feather beds.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}} The tests produced \"jets of molten, burning plutonium extending hundreds of feet into the air.\"<ref name=\"arpansa\">{{cite web |url=http://arpansa.gov.au//pubs/basics/maralinga.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831115407/http://arpansa.gov.au//pubs/basics/maralinga.pdf |archivedate=31 August 2008 |title=Maralinga |publisher=Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency |access-date=2 December 2008}}</ref> The damage to the feather beds and their concrete stands was much greater than anticipated, and a new feather bed was used for each round. At the conclusion of each, all the debris was buried in nearby pits. Eventually there were 21 pits containing {{convert|830|t|LT}} of material contaminated with 20&nbsp;kg of plutonium. Another 2&nbsp;kg of plutonium was scattered about the test site.{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|pp=396\u2013398}}\n\nPlutonium is not particularly dangerous externally as it emits [[alpha particles]] which are stopped by {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} of air, or the dead layer of skin cells on the body, and is not a very intensive source of radiation, due to its long half-life of 24,000 years. It is dangerous when it enters the body, in the worst case by breathing and lodging in the lungs, and therefore tiny particles, often the result of such explosion testing, are the worst threat.  The extreme biological persistence of plutonium's [[radioactive contamination]] and the cancer threat posed by alpha radiation occurring internally together establish plutonium's dangers.{{sfn|Kaku|Trainer|1983|p=77}}\n\nDuring the Operation Antler trials, the British government had given the AWTSC reassurances that safety measures were in place to prevent balloons from breaking loose. Despite this, two balloons broke free during a [[squall]] on 22 July 1959. One was subsequently recovered but the other was not. A board of inquiry was held,{{sfn|Symonds|1985|pp=502\u2013503}} but an even more embarrassing incident occurred on the night of 23/24 September 1960, when seven of the eight balloons being readied for experiments broke free of their moorings during a thunderstorm. Five were recovered on the range on 27 September, but two were lost and drifted further afield, one being recovered near [[Cobar]] in New South Wales on 24 September and the other around [[Hungerford, Queensland|Hungerford]] in New South Wales, which was not located until 1 October. Titterton wrote a critical letter to the AWRE. It was clear that the procedures for prevent balloon escapes had been inadequate and the self-destruction devices were unreliable.{{sfn|Symonds|1985|p=516}}{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|p=227}}{{sfn|McClelland|1985b|p=413}}\n\n===Fallout===\nIn the late 1950s, [[Hedley Marston]]'s research into [[nuclear fallout]] from the Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the AWTSC, resulting in one of the more memorable feuds in Australian science.{{sfn|Sherratt|2002|pp=209\u2013210}} Marston was the head of the Division of Biology and General Nutrition at the [[CSIRO]], and was commissioned by the AWTSC to study the concentrations of [[iodine-131]] in the thyroids of sheep and cattle. A 1954 American report assessed that there was no public health danger, but the AWTSC wanted to be able to monitor the Australian situation. Surveys started before the tests at Maralinga commenced in order to establish a baseline. Marston's results indicated a rise in iodine-131 due to Operation Mosaic. It was not enough to pose a public health hazard\u2014his results indicated that the concentration was about 1 per cent of the acceptable limit\u2014but it did indicate that fallout was more widespread than first thought. . He then attempted to extrapolate his results to [[strontium-90]], but a valid assessment could not be made in this way, and was therefore no more than speculation. In 1961 the AWTSC published a study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. It did find an increase in strontium-90 in Australia, but it was a quarter of that recorded in the UK. Although the 1958 Operation Grapple thermonuclear tests had a measurable effect in the UK, none was detected in Australia.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=204\u2013208}}{{sfn|Bryant|Dwyer|Stevens|Titterton|1961|pp=754\u2013757}}\n\n==Closure==\nMaralinga was conceived as a testing ground where major tests could be conducted annually, but this did not occur, and Operation Antler was the last major test series conducted there. One reason was public sentiment. A 1952 poll indicated that 58 per cent of Australians supported British nuclear testing in Australia, with only 29 per cent against, but support steadily declined, and by 1957 only 37 per cent were in favour, with 49 per cent opposed. This augured poorly for the future of Maralinga, if there was a change of government, and the [[1961 Australian federal election]] reduced Menzies' majority to just one seat. The decline in Australian support for testing was part of a worldwide trend that resulted in the moratorium on nuclear testing from November 1958 to September 1961.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}}\n\nMaralinga was now redundant, as the Australian government's restriction on testing thermonuclear weapons had led to the development of the Christmas Island test site, where there was no such restriction, and its favourable winds carried fallout away. With the [[1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement]], Britain also gained access to the Nevada Test Site,{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}} where the first British major test took place underground on 1 March 1962,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awe.co.uk/main_site/about_awe/history/timeline/1962/ |title=UK Mounts First Underground Nuclear Test (UGT) |publisher=Atomic Weapons Establishment |access-date=15 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118030522/http://www.awe.co.uk/main_site/about_awe/history/timeline/1962/ |archive-date=18 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> but there was no certainty that Nevada would be available in the future. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty banned atmospheric testing, and no site was located at the Maralinga Range for underground testing; the nearest suitable site was on Aboriginal land {{convert|250|mi|order=flip}} away. After 1963, Maralinga was placed on caretaker status, and although there was some discussion about conducting minor trials in 1966, in view of the fact that the 1956 Memorandum of Arrangements was due to expire in March of that year, the British government decided that it would not seek to extend or renew the agreement.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}} A formal memorandum on the termination of the 1956 Memorandum of Arrangements was signed on 23 September 1967, and the UK was released from most liabilities and responsibilities on 21 December 1967.{{sfn|Arnold|Smith|2006|pp=235\u2013239}} In December 1968, the Minister for Defence revoked the declaration of Maralinga as a prohibited area under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952.{{sfn|Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee|2002|p=15}} On 31 August 1972, the Minister for Supply removed the restrictions on most of the Maralinga Prohibited Area, retaining only a {{convert|48|by|240|km|adj=on}} strip that became part of the new Woomera Prohibited Area.{{sfn|Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee|2002|p=33}}\n\n==Legacy==\nClean up operations commenced at Maralinga with Operation Clean Up in 1963 and Operation Hercules in 1964. These involved the removal of major hazards to permit entry to the test sites. A major clean up operation codenamed Operation Brumby was conducted in 1967. Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil.

This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n* the [[European Council]], which sets the ''general political directions'' and ''priorities'' of the Union by gathering together its member states' [[Head of state|heads of state]]/[[Head of government|government]] (elected chief executives). The conclusions of its summits (held at least quarterly) are adopted by consensus.\n* the [[European Commission]], the only institution empowered to propose legislation, serves as the \"Guardian of the Treaties\". It consists of an [[Cabinet (government)|executive cabinet]] of public officials, led by an [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] President. This ''College of Commissioners'' manages and directs the Commission's permanent civil service. It turns the consensus objectives of the European Council into [[European Union law|legislative proposals]].\n* the [[Council of the European Union]] brings together ministers of member states governments' departments. It serves to represent the various governments directly and its approval is required for any proposal to enter into law.\n* the [[European Parliament]] consists of 705 directly elected representatives. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states' view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's president, must approve the College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.\n* the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ensures the uniform application of EU law and resolves disputes between EU institutions and member states, and against EU institutions on behalf of individuals.\n* the [[European Central Bank]] is responsible for monetary stability within member states.\n* the [[European Court of Auditors]] investigates the proper management of finances within both the EU entities and EU funding provided to its member states.

This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n* the [[European Council]], which sets the ''general political directions'' and ''priorities'' of the Union by gathering together its member states' [[Head of state|heads of state]]/[[Head of government|government]] (elected chief executives). The conclusions of its summits (held at least quarterly) are adopted by consensus.\n* the [[European Commission]], the only institution empowered to propose legislation, serves as the \"Guardian of the Treaties\". It consists of an [[Cabinet (government)|executive cabinet]] of public officials, led by an [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] President. This ''College of Commissioners'' manages and directs the Commission's permanent civil service. It turns the consensus objectives of the European Council into [[European Union law|legislative proposals]].\n* the [[Council of the European Union]] brings together ministers of member states governments' departments. It serves to represent the various governments directly and its approval is required for any proposal to enter into law.\n* the [[European Parliament]] consists of 705 directly elected representatives. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states' view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's president, must approve the College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.\n* the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ensures the uniform application of EU law and resolves disputes between EU institutions and member states, and against EU institutions on behalf of individuals.\n* the [[European Central Bank]] is responsible for monetary stability within member states.\n* the [[European Court of Auditors]] investigates the proper management of finances within both the EU entities and EU funding provided to its member states. As well as providing oversight and advice, it can refer unresolved issues to the European Court of Justice to arbitrate on any alleged irregularities.\n\nEU policy is in general promulgated by [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]], which are then implemented in the [[Sovereignty|domestic legislation]] of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], which are immediately enforceable in all member states.

What's really for dinner? The truth about commercial pet food. The Animals' Agenda. 1996. Nov. - Dec.</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see [[dog biscuit]]s and [[dog food]]). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\n{{quote|text=It is... thought wrongly that the cat, ill-fed, hunts better and takes more mice; this too is a grave error. The cat who is not given food is feeble and sickly; as soon as he has bitten into a mouse, he lies down to rest and sleep; while well fed, he is wide awake and satisfies his natural taste in chasing all that belongs to the rat family.<ref>Mauny de Mornay, ''Livre de l'eleveur et du proprietaire d'animaux domestiques'' 1837 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA287&id=tBkGwxXqxpgC&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn 1844, another French writer{{Who|date=February 2015}} expanded on this idea:\n{{quote|text=Normally in the country no care is taken of a cat's food, and he is left to live, it is said, from his hunting, but when he is hungry, he hunts the pantry's provisions far more than the mouse; because he does not pursue them and never watches them by need, but by instinct and attraction. And so, to neglect feeding a cat, is to render him at the same time useless and harmful, while with a few scraps regularly and properly given, the cat will never do any damage, and will render much service.<ref>Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard, ''Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'\u00e9lever de soigner les animaux '' 1844 https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA2-PA328&id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\n{{quote|text=If then, only for the sake of making (a cat) more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. [[Experience is the best teacher]] as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served\u2014a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.\u2014If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\n\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,\u2014which ought only to be given occasionally,\u2014is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her ''two regular meals''.<ref>Gordon Stables,'' 'Cats': their points and characteristics, with Curiosities of cat life, and ...'' 1876 https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA371&id=iUUDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0&q=cat%20food%20%22cat%20food%22&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for [[Spratt's|Spratt]] (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\"<ref>ad for Spratt's https://books.google.com/books?id=5-ANAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP8</ref> And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\n{{quote|text=Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have ''water'' as well as milk. I think boiled [[Lights (offal)|lights]], cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.<ref>Gordon Stable, ''The domestic cat'', 1876, 61 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA61&id=30oDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently [[horse meat]], was sold from barrows (hand\u2013carts) by itinerant traders known as ''Cats' Meat Men''.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68598/john-galt-cats-meat-man-c-1901 | title=Cats' Meat Man: c.1901 | publisher=Museum of London | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Natural diet ==\n{{see also|Felis lybica#Diet}}\nCats are obligate [[carnivore]]s\u2014meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timeforpaws.co.uk/blog/wild-cats/|title = Wild Cats Survive - Time for Paws - Time for Paws|website = Time for Paws|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}</ref> as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an [[Vomiting|emetic]].\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids [[taurine]] and [[arginine]], so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\n==Packaging and labeling==\n{{further|Pet food#Labeling and regulation}}\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petfood.aafco.org/Labeling-Labeling-Requirements|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Labeling & Labeling Requirements|website=petfood.aafco.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/#cat-food | title = Cat Food Reviews: The Pleasure of Their Company | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial cat food diets==\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as ''kibble'', or wet canned form. Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who [[raw feeding|feed raw]].\n\n===Dry food diet===\n[[File:Katzenfutter.JPG|left|thumb|Dry (extruded) cat food example]]\nDry food (8\u201310% moisture) is generally made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase [[palatability]], and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\n===Wet food diet===\n[[File:Canned Cat Food1.jpg|right|thumb|Wet (canned) cat food example (Fish flakes in jelly)]]\nIn much of Europe, the UK and the US, [[canning|canned]] or wet food (75\u201378% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 [[ounce|oz]] (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes. It is also sold in foil pouch form\n\n===Renal diet===\n{{main|Renal diet}}\nA [[renal diet]] is formulated for cats that are living with chronic kidney disease, or CKD.

Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. \n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain.<ref name=\":6\" /> In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spofford|first=N|date=2014|title=A moderate fat, low-energy dry expanded diet reduces gain in body condition score when fed as part of a post neutering weight-control regimen in growing pet cats|url=|journal=Journal of Nutritional Science|volume=3|pages=e40|doi=10.1017/jns.2014.48|pmid=26101609|pmc=4473151}}</ref> Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets have significantly reduced incidences of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5&nbsp;kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montes de Oca|first=M|date=2017|title=Prediction equations for metabolizable and digestible energy in feline diets|url=|journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and [[commensal bacteria]]l growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation.<ref name=\":18\" /> Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, [[psyllium]] and [[cellulose]].\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy before using fat stores,  even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food.<ref name=\":6\" /> The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is [[L-carnitine]]. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Center|first=SA|date=2012|title=Influence of dietary supplementation with (L)-carnitine on metabolic rate, fatty acid oxidation, body condition and weight loss in overweight cats|url=|journal=Cornell University: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine|volume=73|issue=7|pages=1012\u20131015|pmid=22738052|doi=10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1002}}</ref> At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their{{clarify|date=December 2017}} effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\n===Grain-free diet===\nGrain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca. \n\nA study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains.

It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Sone grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nA recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked grain free diets to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] in both dogs and cats.

Calcium oxalate stones can also occur if the urine is too acidic.

Biosynthesis of niacin occurs by metabolism of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway to quinolinic acid, the niacin precursor. However, cats have a high activity of picolinic acid carboxylase, which converts one of the intermediates to picolinic acid instead of quinolinic acid. As a result, niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.\n\n===Arginine===\n{{see|urea cycle}}\nCats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] in the small intestine (specifically, for [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] production).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = QR | last2 = Phang | first2 = JM | year = 1985 | title = Deficiency of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase in the intestinal mucosa of the cat | url = | journal = J Nutr | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 146\u201350 | doi = 10.1093/jn/115.1.146 }}</ref> Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to [[hyperammonemia]]. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.\n\n=== Zinc ===\nZinc's connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular

The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]]/flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]).

Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of [[melamine]] in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall.

What's really for dinner? The truth about commercial pet food. The Animals' Agenda. 1996. Nov. - Dec.</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see [[dog biscuit]]s and [[dog food]]). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\n{{quote|text=It is... thought wrongly that the cat, ill-fed, hunts better and takes more mice; this too is a grave error. The cat who is not given food is feeble and sickly; as soon as he has bitten into a mouse, he lies down to rest and sleep; while well fed, he is wide awake and satisfies his natural taste in chasing all that belongs to the rat family.<ref>Mauny de Mornay, ''Livre de l'eleveur et du proprietaire d'animaux domestiques'' 1837 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA287&id=tBkGwxXqxpgC&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn 1844, another French writer{{Who|date=February 2015}} expanded on this idea:\n{{quote|text=Normally in the country no care is taken of a cat's food, and he is left to live, it is said, from his hunting, but when he is hungry, he hunts the pantry's provisions far more than the mouse; because he does not pursue them and never watches them by need, but by instinct and attraction. And so, to neglect feeding a cat, is to render him at the same time useless and harmful, while with a few scraps regularly and properly given, the cat will never do any damage, and will render much service.<ref>Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard, ''Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'\u00e9lever de soigner les animaux '' 1844 https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA2-PA328&id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\n{{quote|text=If then, only for the sake of making (a cat) more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. [[Experience is the best teacher]] as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served\u2014a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.\u2014If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\n\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,\u2014which ought only to be given occasionally,\u2014is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her ''two regular meals''.<ref>Gordon Stables,'' 'Cats': their points and characteristics, with Curiosities of cat life, and ...'' 1876 https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA371&id=iUUDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0&q=cat%20food%20%22cat%20food%22&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for [[Spratt's|Spratt]] (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\"<ref>ad for Spratt's https://books.google.com/books?id=5-ANAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP8</ref> And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\n{{quote|text=Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have ''water'' as well as milk. I think boiled [[Lights (offal)|lights]], cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.<ref>Gordon Stable, ''The domestic cat'', 1876, 61 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA61&id=30oDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently [[horse meat]], was sold from barrows (hand\u2013carts) by itinerant traders known as ''Cats' Meat Men''.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68598/john-galt-cats-meat-man-c-1901 | title=Cats' Meat Man: c.1901 | publisher=Museum of London | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Natural diet ==\nCats are obligate [[carnivore]]s\u2014meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timeforpaws.co.uk/blog/wild-cats/|title = Wild Cats Survive - Time for Paws - Time for Paws|website = Time for Paws|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}</ref> as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an [[Vomiting|emetic]].\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids [[taurine]] and [[arginine]], so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\n==Packaging and labeling==\n{{further|Pet food#Labeling and regulation}}\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petfood.aafco.org/Labeling-Labeling-Requirements|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Labeling & Labeling Requirements|website=petfood.aafco.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/#cat-food | title = Cat Food Reviews: The Pleasure of Their Company | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial cat food diets==\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as ''kibble'', or wet canned form. Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who [[raw feeding|feed raw]].\n\n===Dry food diet===\n[[File:Katzenfutter.JPG|left|thumb|Dry (extruded) cat food example]]\nDry food (8\u201310% moisture) is generally made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase [[palatability]], and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\n===Wet food diet===\n[[File:Canned Cat Food1.jpg|right|thumb|Wet (canned) cat food example (Fish flakes in jelly)]]\nIn much of Europe, the UK and the US, [[canning|canned]] or wet food (75\u201378% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 [[ounce|oz]] (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes.

Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. \n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain.<ref name=\":6\" /> In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spofford|first=N|date=2014|title=A moderate fat, low-energy dry expanded diet reduces gain in body condition score when fed as part of a post neutering weight-control regimen in growing pet cats|url=|journal=Journal of Nutritional Science|volume=3|pages=e40|doi=10.1017/jns.2014.48|pmid=26101609|pmc=4473151}}</ref> Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets have significantly reduced incidences of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5&nbsp;kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montes de Oca|first=M|date=2017|title=Prediction equations for metabolizable and digestible energy in feline diets|url=|journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and [[commensal bacteria]]l growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation.<ref name=\":18\" /> Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, [[psyllium]] and [[cellulose]].\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy before using fat stores,  even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food.<ref name=\":6\" /> The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is [[L-carnitine]]. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Center|first=SA|date=2012|title=Influence of dietary supplementation with (L)-carnitine on metabolic rate, fatty acid oxidation, body condition and weight loss in overweight cats|url=|journal=Cornell University: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine|volume=73|issue=7|pages=1012\u20131015|pmid=22738052|doi=10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1002}}</ref> At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their{{clarify|date=December 2017}} effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\n===Grain-free diet===\nGrain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca. \n\nA study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains.

It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Sone grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nA recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked grain free diets to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] in both dogs and cats.

As a result, niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.\n\n===Arginine===\n{{see|urea cycle}}\nCats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] in the small intestine (specifically, for [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] production).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = QR | last2 = Phang | first2 = JM | year = 1985 | title = Deficiency of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase in the intestinal mucosa of the cat | url = | journal = J Nutr | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 146\u201350 | doi = 10.1093/jn/115.1.146 }}</ref> Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to [[hyperammonemia]]. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.\n\n=== Zinc ===\nZinc's connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular

The main complaint is excessive scratching ([[pruritus]]) which is usually resistant to treatment by [[Glucocorticoid|steroidal]] [[anti-inflammatory]] [[medication|drugs]]. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]]/flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with [[Elimination diet|dietary elimination-challenge trials]]. [[Food allergy|Allergy]] [[Allergy testing|testing]] is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Verlinden A, Hesta M, Millet S, Janssens GP |title=Food allergy in dogs and cats: a review |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=259\u201373 |year=2006 |pmid=16527756 |doi=10.1080/10408390591001117 }}</ref>\n\n== Malnutrition ==\nMalnutrition can be a problem for cats fed non-conventional diets. Cats fed exclusively on raw, [[freshwater fish]] can develop a [[thiamine]] deficiency. Those fed exclusively on liver may develop [[vitamin A]] toxicity. Also, exclusively meat-based diets may contain excessive [[protein]] and [[phosphorus]] whilst being deficient in [[calcium]], [[vitamin E]], and [[microminerals]] such as [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[potassium]]. [[Energy density]] must also be maintained relative to the other [[nutrients]]. When [[vegetable oil]] is used to maintain the energy balance cats may not find the food as [[palatable]].<ref>{{cite book\n| url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/182902.htm\n| title = Nutritional Requirements and Related Diseases\n| accessdate = 2006-10-27\n| author = John E.

Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of [[melamine]] in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsweek.com/capitalizing-pet-food-panic-101439|title = CAPITALIZING ON PET-FOOD PANIC|date = 2007-05-07|access-date = |website = }}</ref>\n\n=== Bisphenol A ===\nA 2004 study reported that food packaged in cans coated with [[bisphenol A]] is correlated with the development of [[hyperthyroidism]] in cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edinboro|first=Charlotte H.|author2=Scott-Moncrieff, Catharine|author3=Janovitz, Evan|author4=Thacker, Leon|author5=Glickman, Larry T.|date=March 2004|title=Epidemiologic study of relationships between consumption of commercial canned food and risk of hyperthyroidism in cats|journal=[[Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]]|volume=224|issue=6|pages=879\u201386|doi=10.2460/javma.2004.224.879|pmid=15070058|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b566d8fdb56f18898f109058a7b625762764878}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{further|Overfishing}}\n{{See also|Environmental effects of meat production}}\nIn a study on the impacts of the pet food industry on world fish and seafood supplies, researchers estimate that 2.48 million metric tonnes of fish are used by the cat food industry each year.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=De Silva SS, Turchini GM |title=Towards Understanding the Impacts of the Pet Food Industry on World Fish and Seafood Supplies |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=459\u201367 |date=October 2008 |doi=10.1007/s10806-008-9109-6  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.petfoodindustry.com/ViewNews.aspx?id=22588 Cats taking a bite out of world fish supply] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114120956/http://www.petfoodindustry.com/ViewNews.aspx?id=22588 |date=2009-01-14 }} Petfood Industry News</ref> It was suggested that there needs to be \"a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource, for human benefit.\" [[Marine conservation]] activist [[Paul Watson]] argues that the reduction in [[forage fish]] such as those commonly used in cat food (sardines, herring, anchovy etc.) negatively affects fish higher up the food chain like cod, tuna and swordfish, not to mention marine mammals and birds.<ref>[http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-080828-1.html Aqua Cats Are Eating the Oceans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223225656/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-080828-1.html |date=2009-02-23 }} Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</ref>\n\nBased on 2004 numbers, cats in the US consume the caloric equivalent of what 192,000 ([[Demographics of the United States#Vital statistics|0.0655187%]]) Americans consume.

The show stars [[Tim Allen]] as an executive at a sporting goods store chain headquartered in Denver, Colorado, who is a married father of three daughters and a grandfather to his eldest daughter's son. ''Last Man Standing'' is a joint production by [[21 Laps Entertainment|21 Laps]]-Adelstein Productions, NestEgg Productions, and [[20th Century Fox Television]] and syndicated by [[20th Television]].\n\nThe series originally ran on ABC from 2011 to 2017 for six seasons, and entered [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 2015.
