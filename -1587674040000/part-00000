The panda carries a red umbrella and speaks in a \"slight panda accent\". For the next three days, the three kids visit Stillwater. The panda rewards each with instructive [[anecdotes]]. To Michael he tells a story about good and bad boundaries, he tells Addy a story about the value of material goods, and Karl a story on how to hold frustration.

There are two main groups: the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. \n\nThese islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the [[Mesolithic]], and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of [[Celtic language|Celtic-speaking]], [[Old Norse language|Norse-speaking]], and [[English language|English-speaking]] peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps [[prehistoric]] times.\n\nThe Hebrides are the source of much of [[Scottish Gaelic literature]] and [[Gaelic music]]. Today the economy of the islands is dependent on [[crofting]], fishing, [[tourism]], the oil industry, and [[renewable energy]]. The Hebrides have lower biodiversity than mainland Scotland, but there is a significant presence of seals and seabirds.\n\ncomponent oily sabotage nowhere\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest written references that have survived relating to the islands were made circa 77 AD by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Natural History'', where he states that there are 30 ''{{lang|la|Hebudes}}'', and makes a separate reference to ''{{lang|la|Dumna}}'', which [[William J. Watson|Watson]] (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150&nbsp;AD, [[Ptolemy]], drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of {{lang|la|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]}}, writes that there are five ''{{lang|la|Ebudes}}'' (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and ''{{lang|la|Dumna}}''.<ref name=\"Breeze\">Breeze, David J. \"The ancient geography of Scotland\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13</ref><ref name=\"Watson\">Watson (1926) pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref name=\"W38\">Watson (1994) p. 38</ref> Later texts in classical [[Latin language|Latin]], by writers such as {{lang|la|[[Solinus]]}}, use the forms ''{{lang|la|Hebudes}}'' and ''{{lang|la|H\u00e6budes}}''.<ref>Louis Deroy & Marianne Mulon (1992) ''{{lang|fr|Dictionnaire de noms de lieux}}'', Paris: Le Robert, article \"H\u00e9brides\"</ref>\n\nThe name ''{{lang|la|Ebudes}}'' recorded by Ptolemy may be pre-Celtic.<ref name=\"W38\"/> Islay is Ptolemy's {{lang|grc-Latn|Epidion}},<ref name=W37>Watson (1994) p. 37</ref> the use of the \"p\" hinting at a [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] or Pictish tribal name, {{lang|cel|[[Epidii]]}},<ref>Watson (1994) p. 45</ref> although the root is not Gaelic.<ref name=\"G2487\">Gammeltoft, Peder \"Scandinavian Naming-Systems in the Hebrides - A Way of Understanding how the Scandinavians were in Contact with Gaels and Picts?\" in Ballin Smith ''et al'' (2007) p. 487</ref> [[Alex Woolf|Woolf]] (2012) has suggested that ''{{lang|la|Ebudes}}'' may be \"an Irish attempt to reproduce the word ''{{lang|cel|Epidii}}'' phonetically rather than by translating it\" and that the tribe's name may come from the root ''{{lang|xtg|epos}}'' meaning \"horse\".<ref name=woolf>[[Alex Woolf|Woolf, Alex]] (2012) [https://www.academia.edu/1502702/Ancient_Kindred_Dal_Riata_and_the_Cruthin ''Ancient Kindred?

There are two main groups: the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. \n\nThese islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the [[Mesolithic]], and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of [[Celtic language|Celtic-speaking]], [[Old Norse language|Norse-speaking]], and [[English language|English-speaking]] peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps [[prehistoric]] times.\n\nThe Hebrides are the source of much of [[Scottish Gaelic literature]] and [[Gaelic music]]. Today the economy of the islands is dependent on [[crofting]], fishing, [[tourism]], the oil industry, and [[renewable energy]]. The Hebrides have lower biodiversity than mainland Scotland, but there is a significant presence of seals and seabirds.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest written references that have survived relating to the islands were made circa 77 AD by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Natural History'', where he states that there are 30 ''{{lang|la|Hebudes}}'', and makes a separate reference to ''{{lang|la|Dumna}}'', which [[William J. Watson|Watson]] (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150&nbsp;AD, [[Ptolemy]], drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of {{lang|la|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]}}, writes that there are five ''{{lang|la|Ebudes}}'' (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and ''{{lang|la|Dumna}}''.<ref name=\"Breeze\">Breeze, David J. \"The ancient geography of Scotland\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13</ref><ref name=\"Watson\">Watson (1926) pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref name=\"W38\">Watson (1994) p. 38</ref> Later texts in classical [[Latin language|Latin]], by writers such as {{lang|la|[[Solinus]]}}, use the forms ''{{lang|la|Hebudes}}'' and ''{{lang|la|H\u00e6budes}}''.<ref>Louis Deroy & Marianne Mulon (1992) ''{{lang|fr|Dictionnaire de noms de lieux}}'', Paris: Le Robert, article \"H\u00e9brides\"</ref>\n\nThe name ''{{lang|la|Ebudes}}'' recorded by Ptolemy may be pre-Celtic.<ref name=\"W38\"/> Islay is Ptolemy's {{lang|grc-Latn|Epidion}},<ref name=W37>Watson (1994) p. 37</ref> the use of the \"p\" hinting at a [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] or Pictish tribal name, {{lang|cel|[[Epidii]]}},<ref>Watson (1994) p. 45</ref> although the root is not Gaelic.<ref name=\"G2487\">Gammeltoft, Peder \"Scandinavian Naming-Systems in the Hebrides - A Way of Understanding how the Scandinavians were in Contact with Gaels and Picts?\" in Ballin Smith ''et al'' (2007) p. 487</ref> [[Alex Woolf|Woolf]] (2012) has suggested that ''{{lang|la|Ebudes}}'' may be \"an Irish attempt to reproduce the word ''{{lang|cel|Epidii}}'' phonetically rather than by translating it\" and that the tribe's name may come from the root ''{{lang|xtg|epos}}'' meaning \"horse\".<ref name=woolf>[[Alex Woolf|Woolf, Alex]] (2012) [https://www.academia.edu/1502702/Ancient_Kindred_Dal_Riata_and_the_Cruthin ''Ancient Kindred?

The following are the ten largest in the Hebrides and their outliers.\n\nThe [[St Kilda, Scotland#Origin of names|etymology of St Kilda]], a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides, and its main island [[Hirta]], is very complex. No [[saint]] is known by the name of Kilda, and various theories have been proposed for the word's origin, which dates from the late 16th century.<ref>Buchanan (1983) Pages 2\u20136.</ref> Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name \"St Kilda\" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it may have been derived from Norse ''{{lang|non|sunt kelda}}'' (\"sweet wellwater\") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring ''{{lang|gd|Tobar Childa}}'' was dedicated to a saint (''{{lang|gd|Tobar Childa}}'' is a [[list of tautological place names|tautological placename]], consisting of the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and [[Old Norse|Norse]] words for ''well'', i.e. \"well well\").<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 314\u201325.</ref> The origin of the Gaelic for \"Hirta\"\u2014''{{lang|gd|Hiort}}'', ''{{lang|gd|Hirt}}'', or ''{{lang|gd|Irt}}''<ref>Newton, Michael Steven. The Naughty Little Book of Gaelic: All the Scottish Gaelic You Need to Curse, Swear, Drink, Smoke and Fool around. Sydney, Nova Scotia: Cape Breton UP, 2014.</ref>\u2014which long pre-dates the use of \"St Kilda\", is similarly open to interpretation. Watson (1926) offers the Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|hirt}}'', a word meaning \"death\", possibly relating to the dangerous seas.<ref>Watson (1994) p. 97</ref> Maclean (1977), drawing on an [[Icelanders' sagas|Icelandic saga]] describing an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland that mentions a visit to the islands of ''{{lang|non|Hirtir}}'', speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a [[stag]], ''{{lang|non|hirtir}}'' being \"stags\" in Norse.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 33.</ref>\n\nThe etymology of small islands may be no less complex. In relation to {{lang|gd|[[Dubh Artach]]}}, [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R. L.

It was found to be in poor mechanical condition and was later placed on static display pending overhaul, most recently at the [[Ribble Steam Railway]], although since early 2020 it has been at the East Lancashire Railway at Bury.\nL&YR No. 68 (LMS No. 11218, BR No. 51218), built in 1901, was purchased directly from British Rail in 1964 and moved to the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]] in January 1965. The locomotive was re-tubed in 1974 and took part in the Stockton & Darlington Railway cavalcade that year. The locomotive was overhauled again in 1997 and continued in service, albeit mostly as a shunting locomotive due to its low power, until its boiler tubes required replacement in 2006. The locomotive carried its original identity of L&YR 68 from 2004 onwards, but has been cosmetically restored in 2018 to 51218 for the K&WVR's 50th Anniversary Gala, reflecting that 51218 was the first loco to arrive in 1965. Overhaul is now under consideration at Haworth on the K&WVR as the restoration of 0-6-0ST No. 752 has now been completed at the [[East Lancashire Railway]].<ref>http://www.lyrtrust.org.uk/</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nSeveral models of the 'Pug' have been produced commercially.\n\nThe first was a 'OO'-scale polystyrene kit made in the 1960s by [[Kitmaster]], the moulds for which were subsequently sold to [[Airfix]] then passed on to [[Dapol]], which still manufactures the former Airfix plastic kit range. This kit has often been used as the basis for a narrow-gauge 'pug bash' locomotive running on [[00-9]] tracks.\n\nA ready-to-run OO model was produced initially by Dapol and then [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] where the Pug was produced until 2000. The Pug was reintroduced to Hornby's range in 2010 (R2927) in early British Railways Livery. \n\nLarger scale models are available from a number of suppliers including Tower Models of Blackpool.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pug (steam locomotive)]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Baxter-BritishLocoCat3B|pages=69\u201370, 88\u201389}}\n*{{0-7110-0554-0|pages=111\u2013112}}\n*{{cite book |last=Earnshaw |first=Alan |year=1993 |title=Trains in Trouble: Vol. 8 |location=Penryn |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=0-906899-52-4 |ref=harv }}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|L&YR Class 21}}\n* [http://www.lyrtrust.org.uk/index.html Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust, owners of 19 and 68]\n* [http://www.railuk.co.uk/steam/getsteamclass.php?item=LYR21 Railuk database]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120180344/http://www.rsr.steamrailways.com/stocklist/no19.htm Details of no. 19]\n\n{{Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Locomotives}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:LandYR Class 21}}\n[[Category:Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway locomotives|21]]\n[[Category:0-4-0ST locomotives]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1886]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox locomotive \n|powertype       = Steam  \n|name            = L&YR Class 21\n|image           = Goole Docks geograph-2224416-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg\n|caption         = L&YR 'Pug' 0-4-0ST at work in Goole Docks 1954\n|designer        = [[John Aspinall (engineer)|John Aspinall]]\n|builder         = {{ubl|[[Vulcan Foundry]] (3)|[[Horwich Works]] (57)}} \n|ordernumber     = Horwich Lots 10, 20, 26, 46, 52, 65\n|serialnumber    = {{ubl|VF: 1176\u20131178|H: 811\u201320; 921\u201330, 1092\u20131111}}\n|builddate       = 1886, (3) 1891\u20131910 (57)\n|totalproduction = 60\n|whytetype       = [[0-4-0ST]]\n|uicclass        = B n2t\n|gauge           = {{RailGauge|ussg|allk=on}}\n|driverdiameter  = {{convert|3|ft|0|in|m|3|abbr=on}}\n|wheelbase       = {{ubl|''Vulcan:'' {{convert|6|ft|0|in|m|3|abbr=on}}|''Horwich:'' {{convert|5|ft|9|in|m|3|abbr=on}}}}\n|length          =  \n|locoweight      = {{convert|21.25|LT|t ST}}\n|fueltype        = [[Coal]]  \n|fuelcap         =  \n|watercap        =  \n|firearea        =  \n|boilerpressure  = {{ubl|''Vulcan:'' {{convert|140|lbf/in2|MPa|2|abbr=on}};|''Horwich:'' {{convert|160|lbf/in2|MPa|2|abbr=on}}}}\n|totalsurface    = {{convert|475.75|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}\n|cylindercount   = Two, outside\n|cylindersize    = {{convert|13|x|18|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} \n|tractiveeffort  = {{convert|10060|-|11492|lbf|kN|1|abbr=on}} \n|operator        = {{ubl|[[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]|\u2192 [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]|\u2192 [[British Railways]]}}\n|operatorclass   = L&YR: 21\n|powerclass      = LMS: 0F\n|fleetnumbers    = LMS: 11200\u201311257\n|locale          = [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]]\n|retiredate      = 1910\u20131964\n|numinclass      = ''1 January 1923:'' 58;<br>''1 January 1948:'' 23\n|disposition     = Two preserved, remainder [[scrap]]ped\n}}\nThe '''L&YR Class 21''' is a class of small [[0-4-0]][[Saddle tank (locomotive)|ST]] [[steam locomotive]] built by the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] for [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]] duties.

It was found to be in poor mechanical condition and was later placed on static display pending overhaul, most recently at the [[Ribble Steam Railway]].\nL&YR No. 68 (LMS No. 11218, BR No. 51218), built in 1901, was purchased directly from British Rail in 1964 and moved to the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]] in January 1965. The locomotive was re-tubed in 1974 and took part in the Stockton & Darlington Railway cavalcade that year. The locomotive was overhauled again in 1997 and continued in service, albeit mostly as a shunting locomotive due to its low power, until its boiler tubes required replacement in 2006. The locomotive carried its original identity of L&YR 68 from 2004 onwards, but has been cosmetically restored in 2018 to 51218 for the K&WVR's 50th Anniversary Gala, reflecting that 51218 was the first loco to arrive in 1965. Overhaul is now under consideration at Haworth on the K&WVR as the completion of 0-6-0ST No. 752 is now taking place at the [[East Lancashire Railway]].<ref>http://www.lyrtrust.org.uk/</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nSeveral models of the 'Pug' have been produced commercially.\n\nThe first was a 'OO'-scale polystyrene kit made in the 1960s by [[Kitmaster]], the moulds for which were subsequently sold to [[Airfix]] then passed on to [[Dapol]], which still manufactures the former Airfix plastic kit range. This kit has often been used as the basis for a narrow-gauge 'pug bash' locomotive running on [[00-9]] tracks.\n\nA ready-to-run OO model was produced initially by Dapol and then [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] where the Pug was produced until 2000. The Pug was reintroduced to Hornby's range in 2010 (R2927) in early British Railways Livery. \n\nLarger scale models are available from a number of suppliers including Tower Models of Blackpool.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pug (steam locomotive)]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Baxter-BritishLocoCat3B|pages=69\u201370, 88\u201389}}\n*{{0-7110-0554-0|pages=111\u2013112}}\n*{{cite book |last=Earnshaw |first=Alan |year=1993 |title=Trains in Trouble: Vol. 8 |location=Penryn |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=0-906899-52-4 |ref=harv }}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|L&YR Class 21}}\n* [http://www.lyrtrust.org.uk/index.html Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust, owners of 19 and 68]\n* [http://www.railuk.co.uk/steam/getsteamclass.php?item=LYR21 Railuk database]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120180344/http://www.rsr.steamrailways.com/stocklist/no19.htm Details of no. 19]\n\n{{Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Locomotives}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:LandYR Class 21}}\n[[Category:Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway locomotives|21]]\n[[Category:0-4-0ST locomotives]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1886]]\n", "name_user": "Anorakeric", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePreservation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%26YR_Class_21"}

The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside northern Europe, and for the corresponding period in levitate zoo spoon worker [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]]. The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of [[Eurasia]]. It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and Western Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]]; in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]]. The term is less used of areas further east, and not at all beyond [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]].\n\nThe type of culture associated with the Mesolithic varies between areas, but it is associated with a decline in the group hunting of large animals in favour of a broader [[hunter-gatherer]] way of life, and the development of more sophisticated and typically smaller lithic tools and weapons than the heavy chipped equivalents typical of the Paleolithic.  Depending on the region, some use of [[pottery]] and [[History of clothing and textiles#Prehistoric development|textiles]] may be found in sites allocated to the Mesolithic, but generally indications of agriculture are taken as marking [[Neolithic Revolution|transition into the Neolithic]].  The more permanent settlements tend to be close to the sea or inland waters offering a good supply of food. Mesolithic societies are not seen as very complex, and burials are fairly simple; in contrast, grandiose [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] are a mark of the Neolithic.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{main|Three-age_system#Stone_Age_subdivisions}}\n[[File:Evolution of temperature in the Post-Glacial period according to Greenland ice cores.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The Mesolithic is the final period of the [[Pleistocene]] characterized by a progressive rise of temperatures, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]] at the start of the [[Holocene]].

The additional \"Mesolithic\" category was added as an intermediate category by Hodder Westropp in 1866. Westropp's suggestion was immediately controversial.  A British school led by [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] denied any need for an intermediate: the ages blended together like the colors of a rainbow, he said. A European school led by [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet]] asserted that there was a gap between the earlier and later.\n\n[[Edouard Piette]] claimed to have filled the gap with his naming of the [[Azilian]] Culture. [[Knut Stjerna]] offered an alternative in the \"Epipaleolithic\", suggesting a final phase of the Paleolithic rather than an intermediate age in its own right inserted between the Paleolithic and Neolithic.\n\nBy the time of [[Vere Gordon Childe]]'s work, ''The Dawn of Europe'' (1947), which affirms the Mesolithic, sufficient data had been collected to determine that a transitional period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic was indeed a useful concept.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=F.|title=Social differentiering i mesolitiska j\u00e4gar-samlarsamh\u00e4llen|date=1997|publisher=Institutionen f\u00f6r arkeologi och antik historia, Uppsala universitet|location=Uppsala.}}</ref> However, the terms \"Mesolithic\" and \"Epipalaeolitic\" remain in competition, with varying conventions of usage. In the archaeology of Northern Europe, for example for archaeological sites in Great Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, Ukraine, and Russia, the term \"Mesolithic\" is almost always used. In the archaeology of other areas, the term \"Epipaleolithic\" may be preferred by most authors, or there may be divergences between authors over which term to use or what meaning to assign to each.  In the New World, neither term is used (except provisionally in the Arctic).\n\n\"Epipaleolithic\" is sometimes also used alongside \"Mesolithic\" for the final end of the Upper Paleolithic immediately followed by the Mesolithic.<ref>\"final Upper Paleolithic industries occurring at the end of the [[Last glacial period|final glaciation]] which appear to merge technologically into the Mesolithic\" {{cite book|editor1-last=Bahn|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Penguin archaeology guide|date=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-051448-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/penguinarchaeolo0000unse}}</ref> As \"Mesolithic\" suggests an intermediate period, followed by the Neolithic, some authors prefer the term \"Epipaleolithic\" for [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures who are not succeeded by agricultural traditions, reserving \"Mesolithic\" for cultures who are clearly succeeded by the Neolithic Revolution, such as the [[Natufian culture]]. Other authors use \"Mesolithic\" as a generic term for hunter-gatherer cultures after the Last Glacial Maximum, whether they are transitional towards agriculture or not. In addition, terminology appears to differ between archaeological sub-disciplines, with \"Mesolithic\" being widely used in European archaeology, while \"Epipalaeolithic\" is more common in Near Eastern archaeology.\n\n==Europe==\n{{see|Prehistoric Europe#Mesolithic}}\n[[File:\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0448\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u043e\u043b.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Shigir Idol]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e9pulture de Teviec Global.jpg|right|thumb|Two skeletons of women aged between 25 and 35 years, dated between 6740 and 5680 BP, both of whom died a violent death.

The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]], which probably spreads across from the Upper Paleolithic, is a widespread phenomenon, much less well known than the cave-paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, with which it makes an interesting contrast. The sites are now mostly cliff faces in the open air, and the subjects are now mostly human rather than animal, with large groups of small figures; there are 45 figures at [[Roca dels Moros]].  Clothing is shown, and scenes of dancing, fighting, hunting and food-gathering.  The figures are much smaller than the animals of Paleolithic art, and depicted much more schematically, though often in energetic poses.<ref>Sandars, Nancy K., ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'', Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), pp. 87\u201396, 1968 (nb 1st edn.)</ref> A few small engraved [[pendant]]s with suspension holes and simple engraved designs are known, some from northern Europe in [[amber]], and one from [[Star Carr]] in Britain in [[shale]].<ref>[https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/research/mesolithic-shale-pendant/ \"11,000 year old pendant is earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain\"], University of York</ref> The [[Elk's Head of Huittinen]] is a rare Mesolithic animal carving in [[soapstone]] from [[Finland]].\n\nThe rock art in the [[Urals]] appears to show similar changes after the Paleolithic, and the wooden [[Shigir Idol]] is a rare survival of what may well have been a very common material for sculpture.

This pottery-making Mesolithic culture can be found peripheral to the sedentary Neolithic cultures. It created a distinctive type of pottery, with point or knob base and flared rims, manufactured by methods not used by the Neolithic farmers.

The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside northern Europe, and for the corresponding period in [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]]. The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of [[Eurasia]]. It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and Western Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]]; in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]]. The term is less used of areas further east, and not at all beyond [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]].\n\nThe type of culture associated with the Mesolithic varies between areas, but it is associated with a decline in the group hunting of large animals in favour of a broader [[hunter-gatherer]] way of life, and the development of more sophisticated and typically smaller lithic tools and weapons than the heavy chipped equivalents typical of the Paleolithic.  Depending on the region, some use of [[pottery]] and [[History of clothing and textiles#Prehistoric development|textiles]] may be found in sites allocated to the Mesolithic, but generally indications of agriculture are taken as marking [[Neolithic Revolution|transition into the Neolithic]].  The more permanent settlements tend to be close to the sea or inland waters offering a good supply of food. Mesolithic societies are not seen as very complex, and burials are fairly simple; in contrast, grandiose [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] are a mark of the Neolithic.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{main|Three-age_system#Stone_Age_subdivisions}}\n[[File:Evolution of temperature in the Post-Glacial period according to Greenland ice cores.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The Mesolithic is the final period of the [[Pleistocene]] characterized by a progressive rise of temperatures, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]] at the start of the [[Holocene]].

The additional \"Mesolithic\" category was added as an intermediate category by Hodder Westropp in 1866. Westropp's suggestion was immediately controversial.  A British school led by [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] denied any need for an intermediate: the ages blended together like the colors of a rainbow, he said. A European school led by [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet]] asserted that there was a gap between the earlier and later.\n\n[[Edouard Piette]] claimed to have filled the gap with his naming of the [[Azilian]] Culture. [[Knut Stjerna]] offered an alternative in the \"Epipaleolithic\", suggesting a final phase of the Paleolithic rather than an intermediate age in its own right inserted between the Paleolithic and Neolithic.\n\nBy the time of [[Vere Gordon Childe]]'s work, ''The Dawn of Europe'' (1947), which affirms the Mesolithic, sufficient data had been collected to determine that a transitional period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic was indeed a useful concept.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=F.|title=Social differentiering i mesolitiska j\u00e4gar-samlarsamh\u00e4llen|date=1997|publisher=Institutionen f\u00f6r arkeologi och antik historia, Uppsala universitet|location=Uppsala.}}</ref> However, the terms \"Mesolithic\" and \"Epipalaeolitic\" remain in competition, with varying conventions of usage. In the archaeology of Northern Europe, for example for archaeological sites in Great Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, Ukraine, and Russia, the term \"Mesolithic\" is almost always used. In the archaeology of other areas, the term \"Epipaleolithic\" may be preferred by most authors, or there may be divergences between authors over which term to use or what meaning to assign to each.  In the New World, neither term is used (except provisionally in the Arctic).\n\n\"Epipaleolithic\" is sometimes also used alongside \"Mesolithic\" for the final end of the Upper Paleolithic immediately followed by the Mesolithic.<ref>\"final Upper Paleolithic industries occurring at the end of the [[Last glacial period|final glaciation]] which appear to merge technologically into the Mesolithic\" {{cite book|editor1-last=Bahn|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Penguin archaeology guide|date=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-051448-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/penguinarchaeolo0000unse}}</ref> As \"Mesolithic\" suggests an intermediate period, followed by the Neolithic, some authors prefer the term \"Epipaleolithic\" for [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures who are not succeeded by agricultural traditions, reserving \"Mesolithic\" for cultures who are clearly succeeded by the Neolithic Revolution, such as the [[Natufian culture]]. Other authors use \"Mesolithic\" as a generic term for hunter-gatherer cultures after the Last Glacial Maximum, whether they are transitional towards agriculture or not. In addition, terminology appears to differ between archaeological sub-disciplines, with \"Mesolithic\" being widely used in European archaeology, while \"Epipalaeolithic\" is more common in Near Eastern archaeology.\n\n==Europe==\n{{see|Prehistoric Europe#Mesolithic}}\n[[File:\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0448\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u043e\u043b.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Shigir Idol]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e9pulture de Teviec Global.jpg|right|thumb|Two skeletons of women aged between 25 and 35 years, dated between 6740 and 5680 BP, both of whom died a violent death.

The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]], which probably spreads across from the Upper Paleolithic, is a widespread phenomenon, much less well known than the cave-paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, with which it makes an interesting contrast. The sites are now mostly cliff faces in the open air, and the subjects are now mostly human rather than animal, with large groups of small figures; there are 45 figures at [[Roca dels Moros]].  Clothing is shown, and scenes of dancing, fighting, hunting and food-gathering.  The figures are much smaller than the animals of Paleolithic art, and depicted much more schematically, though often in energetic poses.<ref>Sandars, Nancy K., ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'', Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), pp. 87\u201396, 1968 (nb 1st edn.)</ref> A few small engraved [[pendant]]s with suspension holes and simple engraved designs are known, some from northern Europe in [[amber]], and one from [[Star Carr]] in Britain in [[shale]].<ref>[https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/research/mesolithic-shale-pendant/ \"11,000 year old pendant is earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain\"], University of York</ref> The [[Elk's Head of Huittinen]] is a rare Mesolithic animal carving in [[soapstone]] from [[Finland]].\n\nThe rock art in the [[Urals]] appears to show similar changes after the Paleolithic, and the wooden [[Shigir Idol]] is a rare survival of what may well have been a very common material for sculpture.  It is a plank of [[larch]] carved with geometric motifs, but topped with a human head.

Russian archaeologists prefer to describe such pottery-making cultures as Neolithic, even though farming is absent. This pottery-making Mesolithic culture can be found peripheral to the sedentary Neolithic cultures. It created a distinctive type of pottery, with point or knob base and flared rims, manufactured by methods not used by the Neolithic farmers. Though each area of Mesolithic ceramic developed an individual style, common features suggest a single point of origin.<ref>De Roevers, pp. 162\u201363</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The earliest manifestation of this type of pottery may be in the region around Lake Baikal in Siberia.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill.

Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The word ''Bavikonda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] means \"a hill of wells\". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The name \"\u015aankaram\" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three [[chaitya]] halls, votive platforms, stupas and [[Vajrayana]] sculptures.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n{{-}}\n\n==== Bavikonda ====\n[[File:Bavikonda stupas.JPG|thumb|[[Bavikonda]] stupas|alt=Bavikonda Buddhist Complex]]\n\nBavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about 15&nbsp;km, northeast from Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The word ''Bavikonda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] means \"a hill of wells\". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.
