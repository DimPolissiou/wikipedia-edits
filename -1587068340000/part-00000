Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in ''intelligence in general'' (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in ''general intelligence'' or ''g'' factor.<ref name=\":14\" /> The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while ''g'' factor is a [[Latent variable|latent]] scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between ''g'' and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and ''g'' are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to ''g'' factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since [[working memory]] ability correlates highest with ''g'' factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an [[n-back]] working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity, thus contradicting the position put forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nA 2012 review by researchers [[Richard E.

Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in ''intelligence in general'' (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in ''general intelligence'' or ''g'' factor.<ref name=\":14\" /> The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while ''g'' factor is a [[Latent variable|latent]] scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between ''g'' and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and ''g'' are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to ''g'' factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since [[working memory]] ability correlates highest with ''g'' factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an [[n-back]] working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity, thus contradicting the position put forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nA 2012 review by researchers [[Richard E.

Jensen's tests were significantly g-loaded but were not set up to get rid of any sex differences (''read [[differential item functioning]]''). They summarized his conclusions as he quoted, \"No evidence was found for sex differences in the mean level of g or in the variability of g. Males, on average, excel on some factors; females on others.\" Jensen's conclusion that no overall sex differences existed for ''g'' has been reinforced by researchers who analyzed this issue with a battery of 42 mental ability tests and found no overall sex difference.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-30298-001|title = Intelligence New Findings and Theoretical Developments|last = Nisbet|first = Richard E|date = 2012|journal = [[American Psychologist]]|doi = 10.1037/a0026699|pmid = 22233090|access-date =|volume=67|issue = 2|pages=130\u201359}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the tests showed no difference, there were some that did.

One of the most demanding aspects of many tower climber jobs is hauling materials and tools up to the proper installation height on the tower. In most cases, the climber scales the tower to the desired height and lowers a rope to a ground crew member who then ties it to a needed part on the ground. The tower worker then pulls the piece up and secures the rope before installing the part onto the tower.\n\n==Hazards==\nTower climbers may be injured or killed by falling objects, structural collapses and equipment failures. Some of the more frequently encountered hazards include falls from great heights; electrical hazards; hazards associated with hoisting personnel and equipment with base-mounted drum hoists; inclement weather; and structural collapse of towers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vilorio|first=Dennis|title=You\u2019re a what ?
