{"title_page": "Majority judgment", "text_new": "{{Electoral systems}}\n'''Majority judgment''' (MJ) is a single-winner [[voting system]] proposed by [[Michel Balinski]] and Rida Laraki.<ref>{{cite book|author= M. Balinski & R. Laraki|year=2010|title=Majority Judgment. |publisher=MIT |isbn=978-0-262-01513-4}}</ref>   Unlike other voting methods, MJ guarantees that the winner between three or more candidates will be the candidate who had received an absolute majority of the highest grades given by all the voters.\n\n==Voting process==\nVoters grade as many of the candidates' as they wish with regard to their suitability for office as either Excellent (ideal), Very Good, Good, Acceptable, Poor, or Reject. Multiple candidates may be given the same grade by a voter. The candidate with the highest [[median]] grade is the winner.  This median-grade can be found as follows:  Place all the grades, high to low, top to bottom, in side-by-side columns, the name of each candidate at the top of each of these columns.  The median-grade for each candidate is the grade located halfway down each column, i.e. in the middle if there is an odd number of voters, the lower middle if the number is even. If more than one candidate has the same highest median-grade, the MJ winner is discovered by removing (one-by-one) any grades equal in value to the shared median grade from each tied candidate's total.  This is repeated until only one of the previously tied candidates is currently found to have the highest median-grade.<ref>Balinski and Laraki, ''Majority Judgment'', pp.5 & 14</ref> \nConsequently, MJ produces more informative results than the existing alternatives. It is true that if only one of two candidates is to be elected, and the winner has only a few votes more than the near winner, MJ and all the alternative voting methods would discover the same winner.  However, unlike MJ, none of the alternative methods inform us whether the voters saw great merit in both, saw little merit in either, or saw merit in one but not the other.  Only the published results of an MJ election would report exactly how all the voters had graded all the candidates.\n(This same benefit is also offered by [[Proportional Representation#Evaluative Proportional Representation (EPR)|Evaluative Proportional Representation (EPR)]], an adaption of MJ to elect all the members of a legislature at the same time. With EPR, each voter can also guarantee that their vote will proportionately add to the voting power of the elected member of the legislature to whom they had given their highest grade, highest remaining grade, or proxy vote. No vote is \"[[wasted vote|wasted]]\". Each voter and each self-identifying minority or majority is represented proportionately. EPR offers voters an even smaller incentive to vote tactically than does MJ (see below).  Unlike MJ, each EPR voter is assured that their vote will proportionately increase the voting power in the legislature of the winner they give their highest grade, highest remaining grade, or proxy vote.\n\n== Satisfied and failed criteria ==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=October 2011}}\n{{See also|Tactical voting#Majority judgment}}\n\nMajority judgment voting satisfies the [[majority criterion]] for rated ballots, the [[monotonicity criterion]], and the [[later-no-help criterion]]. By assuming that grades are given independently of other candidates, it satisfies the [[independence of clones criterion]] and the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives|independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion]], but the latter criterion is less compatible with the majority criterion if voters instead use their grades only to express [[Ranked voting systems|preferences]] between the available candidates. It passes a rated ballot-analogue of the [[mutual majority criterion]]: if a majority of voters prefer a set of candidates above all others, then someone in this set will win so long as the majority gives everyone in the set a perfect rating and everyone not in the set a less-than-perfect rating. This is because the median voter will be someone in the majority, and they will give everyone in the set a perfect rating, and everyone not in the set a less-than-perfect rating.\n\nMajority judgment fails [[reversal symmetry]], e.g. a candidate whose grades are {Acceptable, Acceptable} will still beat a candidate whose ratings are {good, poor} in both directions.\n \nMajority judgment voting fails the [[Condorcet criterion]],<ref group=note>Strategically in the [[strong Nash equilibrium]], MJ passes the Condorcet criterion.</ref> [[later-no-harm]],<ref group=note>MJ provides a weaker guarantee similar to LNH: rating another candidate at or below your preferred winner's median rating (as opposed to one's own rating for the winner) cannot harm the winner.</ref> [[consistency criterion for voting systems|consistency]],<ref group=note>Majority judgment's inventors argue that meaning should be assigned to the absolute rating that the system assigns to a candidate; that if one electorate rates candidate X as \"excellent\" and Y as \"good\", while another one ranks X as \"acceptable\" and Y as \"poor\", these two electorates do not in fact agree. Therefore, they define a criterion they call \"rating consistency\", which majority judgment passes. Balinski and Laraki, [https://1007421605497013616-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/ridalaraki/xfiles/BalinskiLarakiJudgeDontVotecahierderecherche2010-27.pdf \"Judge, don't Vote\"], November 2010</ref> the [[Condorcet loser criterion]],<ref group=note>Nevertheless, it passes a slightly weakened version, the majority condorcet loser criterion, in which all defeats are by an absolute majority (if there are not equal rankings).</ref> and the [[participation criterion]].<ref group=note>It can fail the participation criterion only when, among other conditions, the new ballot rates both of the candidates in question on the same side of the winning median, and the prior distribution of ratings is more sharply peaked or irregular for one of the candidates.</ref> It also fails the ranked or preferential [[majority criterion]], which is incompatible with the passed criterion [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]].  However, the importance of these failures are diminished by Balinski's response to the following article.\n\n=== Felsenthal and Macover ===\nIn 2008, Felsenthal and Macover's article  <ref>Felsenthal, Dan S. and Machover, Mosh\u00e9, ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.1143&rep=rep1&type=pdf \"The Majority Judgement voting procedure: a critical evaluation\"]'', Homo oeconomicus, vol 25(3/4), pp. 319-334 (2008)</ref>   usefully discussed MJ as presented by Balinski and his associates in 2007.  However, the last part of their discussion claims that MJ is \"afflicted\" most seriously by the fact that it can fail the tests of \"participant-consistency\".  For example, the \"no-show objection\" refers to the paradox that a candidate who is given a higher grade than is need to win can lose as a result.\n\nIn their 2010 book, Balinski and Laraki respond by explaining (pp.&nbsp;285\u2013295) that this theoretical possibility is inherent in any method which uses \"medians\" rather than any \"point-summing\" method to aggregate all citizens' votes.  They go on to describe the following unlikely special circumstances that might allow such a \"failure\" to occur by chance when using MJ:\n1)\tInitially, the total number of voters must be odd.\n2)\tBy these votes alone, candidate X would win and Y would lose (e.g. because X's median grade is \"Very Good\" and Y's is \"Good\").\n3)\tBoth of the potential additional grades to be given to X and Y must either happen to be higher or lower than each competitor's current median grade.\n4)\tThe grade immediately below the current median grade of the current winner(X)  must be at least 2 grades lower, e.g. \"Acceptable\" rather than \"Very Good\".  At the same time, the grade immediately below the current median grade of the current loser, but potential winner (Y), must be higher than the grade immediately below the current median grade of the current winner(X).\n\nFor example, if the additional grades given to X were \"Excellent\", and \"Very Good\" to Y, Y would become the winner instead.  Y's new median grade would be \"Good\" (given the above examples).  X's new median grade would be \"Acceptable\".\nBalinski accepts that such paradoxes are not possible with \"point-summing\" counting methods, but are possible with MJ.  At the same time, he argues that these are not very important.  This is illustrated by the above example.  The additional voter should not be very disappointed if, very rarely if ever, their \"Very Good\" candidate wins instead of their \"Excellent\" candidate.  Consequently, such paradoxes are a very small price to pay for the clear advantages offered by MJ.  Unlike MJ, they do not guarantee that the winner is supported by an absolute majority of all the voters, do not reveal all the grades given to all the candidates by all the voters, and do not remove, almost by \"half\", the opportunities and incentives to vote insincerely (tactical or strategically), and do not prompt voters as clearly--- firstly to consider the qualities required by the office being sought.\n\n=== Claimed resistance to tactical voting ===\nIn arguing for majority judgment, Balinski and Laraki (the system's inventors) logically and mathematically prove that MJ is the most \"strategy-resistant\" of any system that satisfies certain criteria considered desirable by the authors. They show that MJ provides only about \"half\" the opportunities and incentives to vote tactically (dishonestly, strategically) when compared with the alternative methods.<ref>Balinski and Laraki, ''Majority Judgment'', pp.&nbsp;15,17,19,187-198, and 374</ref>\n\n=== Outcome in political environments ===\nIn 2010, [[:fr:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier|J.-F. Laslier]] showed <ref>{{cite web|author=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier|title=On choosing the alternative with the best median evaluation|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00397403/document|website=Public Choice|date=2010}}</ref> that in \"left-right\" environments, majority judgment tends to favor the most homogeneous camp, instead of picking the middle-of-the-road, Condorcet winner candidate. The reason is that, by definition, finding the highest median is something like finding the best rawlsian compromise ([[Minimax|maximin criterion]]) when one allows disregarding almost half of the population.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier|title=The strange \"Majority Judgment\"|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01965227|website=Hal|date=2018}}</ref>\n\nHere is a numerical example. Suppose there were seven ratings named \"Excellent\", \"Very good\", \"Good\", \"Passable\", \"Inadequate\", \"Mediocre\" and \"Bad\". Supposed voters belong to seven groups: Extreme Left, Left, Center Left, Center, Center Right, Right and Extreme Right, and the size of the groups are respectively : 101 voters for each of the three groups on the left, 99 for each of the three groups on the right and 50 for the centrist group. Suppose there are seven candidates, one from each group, and voters assigned their ratings to the seven candidates by giving the candidate closest to their own ideological position the rating \"Excellent\", and then decreasing the rating as candidates are politically further away from them: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!<br /><br />Candidate !! 101 Ext. left<br />voters !! 101 Left<br />voters !! 101 Cent. left<br />voters !! 50 Center<br />voters !!99 Cent. right<br />voters !!99 Right<br />voters !! 99 Ext. right<br />voters !!Median<br />rating\n|-\n| Ext left|| bgcolor=\"green\"|excellent|| bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| bad || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable \n|-\n| Left|| bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"|very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Cent left|| bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Center|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Cent right|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Right || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Ext right|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| bad  || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable \n|}\n\nThe tie-breaking procedure of Majority Judgment elects the Left candidate by an absolute majority, even though the Center Left candidate received a larger absolute majority.  This is because the majority of the Center Left candidate is composed proportionately of fewer Excellents and Very Goods than the majority of the Left candidate (see above).\n\nThe above analysis may suggest that the winner should instead be the candidate who has receive the largest absolute majority with the highest median-grade. Accordingly, Bosworth, et al. suggest that a modification of MJ would guarantee this preferred result.  They call this modification MJ+.

Since there is a tie between Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, \"Fair\" ratings are removed from all three, until their medians become different. After removing 16% \"Fair\" ratings from the votes of each, the sorted ratings are now:\n{|\n|-\n| align=right | City&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| width=49% | &nbsp;\n| width=2% textalign=center | \u2193\n| width=49% | Median point\n|}\n|-\n| align=right | Nashville\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=green width=26% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellow width=26% |\n\n| bgcolor=yellow width=32% |\n\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n|}\n|-\n| align=right | Knoxville\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n| bgcolor=green width=17% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellowgreen width=15% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellow width=10% |\n\n| bgcolor=Orangered width=42% |\n\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n|}\n|-\n| align=right | Chattanooga\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n| bgcolor=green width=15% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellowgreen width=17% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellow width=10% |\n\n| bgcolor=Orangered width=42% |\n\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n|}\n|}\nChattanooga and Knoxville now have the same number of \"Poor\" ratings as \"Fair\", \"Good\" and \"Excellent\" combined.  As a result of subtracting one \"Fair\" from each of the tied cities, one-by-one until only one of these cities has the highest median-grade, the new and deciding median-grades of these originally tied cities are as follows: \"Poor\" for both Chattanooga and Knoxville, while Nashville's median remains at \"Fair\". So '''Nashville''', the capital in real life, wins.\n\nIf voters were more strategic, those from Knoxville and Chattanooga might rate Nashville as \"Poor\" and Chattanooga as \"Excellent\", in an attempt to make their preferred candidate Chattanooga win. Also, Nashville voters might rate Knoxville as \"poor\" to distinguish it from Chattanooga. In spite of these attempts at strategy, the winner would still be Nashville.\n.\n\n== History ==\n\nVoting theory has tended to focus more on [[Ranked voting systems|ranked systems]], so this still distinguishes MJ from most voting system proposals. Second, it uses words, not numbers, to assign a commonly understood meaning to each rating. Balinski and Laraki insist on the importance of the fact that ratings have a commonly understood absolute meaning.  Firstly, MJ prompts voters to clarify in their own minds what qualities the office requires. These qualities are \"absolute\" in the sense that they are independent from any of the qualities any candidates might have or might not have in a future election. They are not purely relative or strategic. Again, this aspect is unusual but not unheard-of throughout the history of voting. Finally, it uses the median to aggregate ratings. This method was explicitly proposed to assign budgets by [[Francis Galton]] in 1907<ref>Francis Galton, \"One vote, one value,\" Letter to the editor, ''Nature'' vol. 75, Feb. 28, 1907, p. 414.</ref> and was implicitly used in [[Bucklin voting]], a ranked or mixed ranked/rated system used soon thereafter in [[Progressive era]] reforms in the United States. Also, hybrid mean/median systems, which throw away a certain predefined number of outliers on each side and then average the remaining scores, have long been used to judge contests such as [[Olympic figure skating]]; such systems, like majority judgment, are intended to limit the impact of biased or strategic judges.\n\nThe full system of Majority judgment was first proposed by Balinski and Laraki in 2007.<ref>Balinski M. and R. Laraki (2007) \u00abA theory of measuring, electing and ranking\u00bb. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, vol. 104, no. 21, 8720-8725.</ref> That same year, they used it in an exit poll of French voters in the presidential election. Although this regional poll was not intended to be representative of the national result, it agreed with other local or national experiments in showing that [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]], rather than the eventual runoff winner, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], or two other candidates ([[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] or [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]) would have won under most alternative rules, including majority judgment. They also note:\n\n<blockquote>\nEveryone with some knowledge of French politics who was shown the results with the names of Sarkozy, Royal, Bayrou and Le Pen hidden invariably identified them: the grades contain meaningful information.<ref>Balinski M. and R.

Multiple candidates may be given the same grade by a voter. The candidate with the highest [[median]] grade is the winner.  This median-grade can be found as follows:  Place all the grades, high to low, top to bottom, in side-by-side columns, the name of each candidate at the top of each of these columns.  The median-grade for each candidate is the grade located halfway down each column, i.e. in the middle if there is an odd number of voters, the lower middle if the number is even. If more than one candidate has the same highest median-grade, the MJ winner is discovered by removing (one-by-one) any grades equal in value to the shared median grade from each tied candidate's total.  This is repeated until only one of the previously tied candidates is currently found to have the highest median-grade.<ref>Balinski and Laraki, ''Majority Judgment'', pp.5 & 14</ref> \nConsequently, MJ produces more informative results than the existing alternatives. It is true that if only one of two candidates is to be elected, and the winner has only a few votes more than the near winner, MJ and all the alternative voting methods would discover the same winner.  However, unlike MJ, none of the alternative methods inform us whether the voters saw great merit in both, saw little merit in either, or saw merit in one but not the other.  Only the published results of an MJ election would report exactly how all the voters had graded all the candidates.\n(This same benefit is also offered by [[Proportional Representation#Evaluative Proportional Representation (EPR)|Evaluative Proportional Representation (EPR)]], an adaption of MJ to elect all the members of a legislature at the same time. With EPR, each voter can also guarantee that their vote will proportionately add to the voting power of the elected member of the legislature to whom they had given their highest grade, highest remaining grade, or proxy vote. No vote is \"[[wasted vote|wasted]]\". Each voter and each self-identifying minority or majority is represented proportionately. EPR offers voters an even smaller incentive to vote tactically than does MJ (see below).  Unlike MJ, each EPR voter is assured that their vote will proportionately increase the voting power in the legislature of the winner they give their highest grade, highest remaining grade, or proxy vote.\n\n== Satisfied and failed criteria ==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=October 2011}}\n{{See also|Tactical voting#Majority judgment}}\n\nMajority judgment voting satisfies the [[majority criterion]] for rated ballots, the [[monotonicity criterion]], and the [[later-no-help criterion]]. By assuming that grades are given independently of other candidates, it satisfies the [[independence of clones criterion]] and the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives|independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion]], but the latter criterion is less compatible with the majority criterion if voters instead use their grades only to express [[Ranked voting systems|preferences]] between the available candidates. It passes a rated ballot-analogue of the [[mutual majority criterion]]: if a majority of voters prefer a set of candidates above all others, then someone in this set will win so long as the majority gives everyone in the set a perfect rating and everyone not in the set a less-than-perfect rating. This is because the median voter will be someone in the majority, and they will give everyone in the set a perfect rating, and everyone not in the set a less-than-perfect rating.\n\nMajority judgment fails [[reversal symmetry]], e.g. a candidate whose grades are {Acceptable, Acceptable} will still beat a candidate whose ratings are {good, poor} in both directions.\n \nMajority judgment voting fails the [[Condorcet criterion]],<ref group=note>Strategically in the [[strong Nash equilibrium]], MJ passes the Condorcet criterion.</ref> [[later-no-harm]],<ref group=note>MJ provides a weaker guarantee similar to LNH: rating another candidate at or below your preferred winner's median rating (as opposed to one's own rating for the winner) cannot harm the winner.</ref> [[consistency criterion for voting systems|consistency]],<ref group=note>Majority judgment's inventors argue that meaning should be assigned to the absolute rating that the system assigns to a candidate; that if one electorate rates candidate X as \"excellent\" and Y as \"good\", while another one ranks X as \"acceptable\" and Y as \"poor\", these two electorates do not in fact agree. Therefore, they define a criterion they call \"rating consistency\", which majority judgment passes. Balinski and Laraki, [https://1007421605497013616-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/ridalaraki/xfiles/BalinskiLarakiJudgeDontVotecahierderecherche2010-27.pdf \"Judge, don't Vote\"], November 2010</ref> the [[Condorcet loser criterion]],<ref group=note>Nevertheless, it passes a slightly weakened version, the majority condorcet loser criterion, in which all defeats are by an absolute majority (if there are not equal rankings).</ref> and the [[participation criterion]].<ref group=note>It can fail the participation criterion only when, among other conditions, the new ballot rates both of the candidates in question on the same side of the winning median, and the prior distribution of ratings is more sharply peaked or irregular for one of the candidates.</ref> It also fails the ranked or preferential [[majority criterion]], which is incompatible with the passed criterion [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]].  However, the importance of these failures are diminished by Balinski's response to the following article.\n\n=== Felsenthal and Macover ===\nIn 2008, Felsenthal and Macover's article  <ref>Felsenthal, Dan S. and Machover, Mosh\u00e9, ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.1143&rep=rep1&type=pdf \"The Majority Judgement voting procedure: a critical evaluation\"]'', Homo oeconomicus, vol 25(3/4), pp. 319-334 (2008)</ref>   usefully discussed MJ as presented by Balinski and his associates in 2007.  However, the last part of their discussion claims that MJ is \"afflicted\" most seriously by the fact that it can fail the tests of \"participant-consistency\".  For example, the \"no-show objection\" refers to the paradox that a candidate who is given a higher grade than is need to win can lose as a result.\n\nIn their 2010 book, Balinski and Laraki respond by explaining (pp.&nbsp;285\u2013295) that this theoretical possibility is inherent in any method which uses \"medians\" rather than any \"point-summing\" method to aggregate all citizens' votes.  They go on to describe the following unlikely special circumstances that might allow such a \"failure\" to occur by chance when using MJ:\n1)\tInitially, the total number of voters must be odd.\n2)\tBy these votes alone, candidate X would win and Y would lose (e.g. because X's median grade is \"Very Good\" and Y's is \"Good\").\n3)\tBoth of the potential additional grades to be given to X and Y must either happen to be higher or lower than each competitor's current median grade.\n4)\tThe grade immediately below the current median grade of the current winner(X)  must be at least 2 grades lower, e.g. \"Acceptable\" rather than \"Very Good\".  At the same time, the grade immediately below the current median grade of the current loser, but potential winner (Y), must be higher than the grade immediately below the current median grade of the current winner(X).\n\nFor example, if the additional grades given to X were \"Excellent\", and \"Very Good\" to Y, Y would become the winner instead.  Y's new median grade would be \"Good\" (given the above examples).  X's new median grade would be \"Acceptable\".\nBalinski accepts that such paradoxes are not possible with \"point-summing\" counting methods, but are possible with MJ.  At the same time, he argues that these are not very important.  This is illustrated by the above example.  The additional voter should not be very disappointed if, very rarely if ever, their \"Very Good\" candidate wins instead of their \"Excellent\" candidate.  Consequently, such paradoxes are a very small price to pay for the clear advantages offered by MJ.  Unlike MJ, they do not guarantee that the winner is supported by an absolute majority of all the voters, do not reveal all the grades given to all the candidates by all the voters, and do not remove, almost by \"half\", the opportunities and incentives to vote insincerely (tactical or strategically), and do not prompt voters as clearly--- firstly to consider the qualities required by the office being sought.\n\n=== Claimed resistance to tactical voting ===\nIn arguing for majority judgment, Balinski and Laraki (the system's inventors) logically and mathematically prove that MJ is the most \"strategy-resistant\" of any system that satisfies certain criteria considered desirable by the authors. They show that MJ provides only about \"half\" the opportunities and incentives to vote tactically (dishonestly, strategically) when compared with the alternative methods.<ref>Balinski and Laraki, ''Majority Judgment'', pp.&nbsp;15,17,19,187-198, and 374</ref>\n\n=== Outcome in political environments ===\nIn 2010, [[:fr:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier|J.-F. Laslier]] showed <ref>{{cite web|author=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier|title=On choosing the alternative with the best median evaluation|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00397403/document|website=Public Choice|date=2010}}</ref> that in \"left-right\" environments, majority judgment tends to favor the most homogeneous camp, instead of picking the middle-of-the-road, Condorcet winner candidate. The reason is that, by definition, finding the highest median is something like finding the best rawlsian compromise ([[Minimax|maximin criterion]]) when one allows disregarding almost half of the population.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laslier|title=The strange \"Majority Judgment\"|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01965227|website=Hal|date=2018}}</ref>\n\nHere is a numerical example. Suppose there were seven ratings named \"Excellent\", \"Very good\", \"Good\", \"Passable\", \"Inadequate\", \"Mediocre\" and \"Bad\". Supposed voters belong to seven groups: Extreme Left, Left, Center Left, Center, Center Right, Right and Extreme Right, and the size of the groups are respectively : 101 voters for each of the three groups on the left, 99 for each of the three groups on the right and 50 for the centrist group. Suppose there are seven candidates, one from each group, and voters assigned their ratings to the seven candidates by giving the candidate closest to their own ideological position the rating \"Excellent\", and then decreasing the rating as candidates are politically further away from them: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!<br /><br />Candidate !! 101 Ext. left<br />voters !! 101 Left<br />voters !! 101 Cent. left<br />voters !! 50 Center<br />voters !!99 Cent. right<br />voters !!99 Right<br />voters !! 99 Ext. right<br />voters !!Median<br />rating\n|-\n| Ext left|| bgcolor=\"green\"|excellent|| bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| bad || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable \n|-\n| Left|| bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"|very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Cent left|| bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Center|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Cent right|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Right || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"yellow\"| good\n|-\n| Ext right|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| bad  || bgcolor=\"orangered\"| mediocre|| bgcolor=\"orangered\"| inadequate|| bgcolor=\"white\"| passable || bgcolor=\"yellow\"|good || bgcolor=\"YellowGreen\"| very good || bgcolor=\"green\"| excellent || bgcolor=\"white\"| passable \n|}\n\nThe tie-breaking procedure of Majority Judgment elects the Left candidate by an absolute majority, even though the Center Left candidate received a larger absolute majority.  This is because the majority of the Center Left candidate is composed proportionately of fewer Excellents and Very Goods than the majority of the Left candidate (see above).\n\nThe above analysis may suggest that the winner should instead be the candidate who has receive the largest absolute majority with the highest median-grade. Accordingly, Bosworth, et al. suggest that a modification of MJ would guarantee this preferred result.  They call this modification MJ+.

Since there is a tie between Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, \"Fair\" ratings are removed from all three, until their medians become different. After removing 16% \"Fair\" ratings from the votes of each, the sorted ratings are now:\n{|\n|-\n| align=right | City&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| width=49% | &nbsp;\n| width=2% textalign=center | \u2193\n| width=49% | Median point\n|}\n|-\n| align=right | Nashville\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=green width=26% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellow width=26% |\n\n| bgcolor=yellow width=32% |\n\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n|}\n|-\n| align=right | Knoxville\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n| bgcolor=green width=17% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellowgreen width=15% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellow width=10% |\n\n| bgcolor=Orangered width=42% |\n\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n|}\n|-\n| align=right | Chattanooga\n|\n{| cellpadding=0 width=500 border=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n| bgcolor=green width=15% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellowgreen width=17% | &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=yellow width=10% |\n\n| bgcolor=Orangered width=42% |\n\n| bgcolor=gray width=8% |\n|}\n|}\nChattanooga and Knoxville now have the same number of \"Poor\" ratings as \"Fair\", \"Good\" and \"Excellent\" combined.  As a result of subtracting one \"Fair\" from each of the tied cities, one-by-one until only one of these cities has the highest median-grade, the new and deciding median-grades of these originally tied cities are as follows: \"Poor\" for both Chattanooga and Knoxville, while Nashville's median remains at \"Fair\". So '''Nashville''', the capital in real life, wins.\n\nIf voters were more strategic, those from Knoxville and Chattanooga might rate Nashville as \"Poor\" and Chattanooga as \"Excellent\", in an attempt to make their preferred candidate Chattanooga win. Also, Nashville voters might rate Knoxville as \"poor\" to distinguish it from Chattanooga. In spite of these attempts at strategy, the winner would still be Nashville.\n.\n\n== History ==\n\nVoting theory has tended to focus more on [[Ranked voting systems|ranked systems]], so this still distinguishes MJ from most voting system proposals. Second, it uses words, not numbers, to assign a commonly understood meaning to each rating. Balinski and Laraki insist on the importance of the fact that ratings have a commonly understood absolute meaning.  Firstly, MJ prompts voters to clarify in their own minds what qualities the office requires. These qualities are \"absolute\" in the sense that they are independent from any of the qualities any candidates might have or might not have in a future election. They are not purely relative or strategic. Again, this aspect is unusual but not unheard-of throughout the history of voting. Finally, it uses the median to aggregate ratings. This method was explicitly proposed to assign budgets by [[Francis Galton]] in 1907<ref>Francis Galton, \"One vote, one value,\" Letter to the editor, ''Nature'' vol. 75, Feb. 28, 1907, p. 414.</ref> and was implicitly used in [[Bucklin voting]], a ranked or mixed ranked/rated system used soon thereafter in [[Progressive era]] reforms in the United States. Also, hybrid mean/median systems, which throw away a certain predefined number of outliers on each side and then average the remaining scores, have long been used to judge contests such as [[Olympic figure skating]]; such systems, like majority judgment, are intended to limit the impact of biased or strategic judges.\n\nThe full system of Majority judgment was first proposed by Balinski and Laraki in 2007.<ref>Balinski M. and R. Laraki (2007) \u00abA theory of measuring, electing and ranking\u00bb. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, vol. 104, no. 21, 8720-8725.</ref> That same year, they used it in an exit poll of French voters in the presidential election. Although this regional poll was not intended to be representative of the national result, it agreed with other local or national experiments in showing that [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]], rather than the eventual runoff winner, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], or two other candidates ([[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] or [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]) would have won under most alternative rules, including majority judgment. They also note:\n\n<blockquote>\nEveryone with some knowledge of French politics who was shown the results with the names of Sarkozy, Royal, Bayrou and Le Pen hidden invariably identified them: the grades contain meaningful information.<ref>Balinski M. and R.

Springer, to appear in 2011.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIt has since been used in judging wine competitions and in other political research polling in France and in the US.<ref>Balinski M. and R.
