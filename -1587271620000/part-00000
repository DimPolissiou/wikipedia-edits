It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Three's Company]]'' and loosely based on the [[British sitcom]] ''[[George and Mildred]]'', which was itself a spin-off of ''[[Man About the House]]'', on which ''Three's Company'' was based.\n\nIt was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] of [[Los Angeles]], where its parent series, ''Three's Company'', was taping at the time, from February to April 1979 (Season 1) and from July 1979 to February 1980 (Season 2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|title=Shows - CBS Television City|work=cbstelevisioncity.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focused on middle-aged couple [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] ([[Norman Fell]]) and [[Helen Roper]] ([[Audra Lindley]]), who were landlords to [[Jack Tripper|Jack]], [[Janet Wood|Janet]] and [[Chrissy Snow|Chrissy]] on ''Three's Company''.\n\nIn this spin-off, the Ropers have sold their apartment building in the ''Three's Company'' episode \"An Anniversary Surprise\" (season 3, episode 20) to live in the upmarket community of [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California|Cheviot Hills]], where the social-climbing Helen struggled to fit in with her neighbors. Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.\n\nAs was the case during their time on ''Three's Company'', opening credits for ''The Ropers'' alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell credited first.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Stanley Roper]]''' ([[Norman Fell]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles|Cheviot Hills]] after he is duped into buying a townhouse\n* '''[[Helen Roper]]''' ([[Audra Lindley]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A sexually frustrated, social-climbing middle-aged woman who tries to fit into the community despite her husband Stanley's constant boorishness. Despite her attempts to fit in, she often proves herself to be as bumbling as her husband.\n* '''Jeffrey P. Brookes III''' ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014The snobbish [[Real estate broker|realtor]] who is also the Ropers' next-door neighbor.\n* '''Anne Brookes''' ([[Patty McCormack|Patricia McCormack]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Brookes' long-suffering, down-to-earth homemaker wife, who looks after the house and their young son David. She and Helen become friendly, despite their husbands' frequently adversarial relationship with one another.\n* '''David Brookes''' (Evan Cohen) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Jeffrey and Anne Brookes' 7-year-old son who is always tempted to bother Mr. Roper, which his parents don't approve.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Jenny Ballinger''' ([[Stevie Vallance|Louise Vallance]]) (season 2)\u2014A young woman who had been living in the Ropers' storeroom\n* '''Ethel Ambrewster''' ([[Dena Dietrich]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Helen's snobby elder sister; gives her an air kiss every time she sees Helen.\n* '''Hubert Ambrewster''' ([[Rod Colbin]])\u2014Ethel's husband and Helen's brother-in-law\n* '''Debbie Hopper''' ([[Lois Hamilton|Lois Areno]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014The girl Stanley sees at the hot tub in the neighborhood\n* '''Joey''' ([[Richard B. Shull]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Stanley's best friend and one of Helen's enemies\n* '''Hilda''' ([[Lucy Lee Flippin]]/Darcy Pulliam) (season 2)\u2014Helen's sister who has 5 children and 1 on the way with her husband, \"Fertile\" Freddy\n* '''Mother''' ([[Lucille Benson]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Helen, Hilda, and Ethel's mother.\n\n==Creation==\nAfter the enormous success of ''Three's Company'' in its short first season in 1977, ABC head [[Fred Silverman]] was anxious to capitalize on the show's success. In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the ''Three's Company'' producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show's continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by ''Three's Company's'' own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to [[NBC]]). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, ''Three's Company'' producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to ''Three's Company''. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.\n\nLike ''Three's Company'', ''The Ropers'' was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as ''Three's Company'' on ABC's successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10{{nbsp}}pm. In its first season, the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show were very high (the show finished at #8 for the 1978\u201379 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time.<ref name=ourdoor>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Chris |title=Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-16803-9|page=113}}</ref> After the season premiere, ''Three's Company'' went on hiatus, but ''The Ropers'' still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nAt the beginning of the 1979\u201380 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (#52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17\u201323, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show ''[[CHiPs]]''. The show later moved to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show wasn't pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show's cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30{{nbsp}}pm after ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann's 1997 book about ''Three's Company'' that she was surprised that ''The Ropers'' had been canceled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979\u201380 season at number 25<ref name=ourdoor/>; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' at number 25.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the series canceled, Fell approached ''Three's Company'' producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time ''The Ropers'' was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on ''Three's Company'' by Ralph Furley ([[Don Knotts]]). The addition had worked well and ''Three's Company'' had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original ''Three's Company'' roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980\u201381 television season that led to her departure from the series. The cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to ''Three's Company''. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.\n\nDespite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on ''Three's Company'' (in Season 5, Episode #18 \"Night of The Ropers\") nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good. For audiences, it was a chance to see all of the three landlord characters &ndash; played by Fell, Lindley, and Knotts &ndash; on the same stage.\n\nTambor appeared on ''Three's Company'' that same season playing a different character, a wealthy but unwelcome suitor of Chrissy's cousin Cindy (Season 5, Episode #13). Tambor also made other guest appearances on ''Three's Company,'' portraying different characters.\n\nThe show was ranked number two on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's \"Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1845866_1846026_1845969,00.html|title=The Ropers, 1979\u201380 \u2013 Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-12-30|date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002 ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''The Ropers'' the 49th worst TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse/page/181 181]}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed spin-off ==\nIn 1986, distributor D. L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spin-off of ''The Ropers'' called ''Three Apartments''. The spin-off would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include [[John Ritter]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Richard Kline]] and [[Don Knotts]] from ''Three's Company''; [[Robert Mandan]] from ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''; and [[Jim J. Bullock|Jm J. Bullock]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] from ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''/''The Ted Knight Show''. ''Three Apartments'' was to replace ''The Ted Knight Show'', a fellow Taffner-distributed show that ended production after the death of show namesake [[Ted Knight]] in August 1986.<ref name=\"Another3ForTaffner\">{{cite magazine |issn=0007-2028 |work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |department=Programing |title=Another 'Three' for Taffner |url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-10-20.pdf |location=Washington |volume=111 |number=16 |publication-date=October 20, 1986 |page=46}}</ref> The spin-off was withdrawn in January 1987 because of a glut of syndicated sitcom offerings, a lack of time slots, and a difficult advertising market.<ref name=\"BuyersMart\">{{cite newspaper |issn=0011-5509 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |volume=326 |number=1 |pages=1, 59 |title=Buyer's mart for syndie shows |given=John |surname=Dempsey |location=New Orleans, Louisiana}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=2| Season\n!

Two episodes of the series, however, play in the syndication package of ''Three's Company''. When initially offered in syndication, the series ran under the title '''''Three's Company's Friends, The Ropers'''''. That version used an instrumental version of the original series' theme song. Six episodes of the series were aired on [[TV Land]] in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on [[WGN America]] in October 2008.\n\nBeginning in January 2011 [[Antenna TV]], a television network designed for digital television subchannels and owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], aired the sitcom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/12/our-exclusive-interview-with-antenna.html|title=Our Exclusive Interview with Antenna TV's Sean Compton; KTLA Preview of Antenna TV; 2011 SAG Nominations - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> The series started on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, and went through one entire rotation of all episodes before being removed from the lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/01/antenna-tv-premieres-ropers-on-feb-15.html|title=Antenna TV Premieres The Ropers on Feb. 15, 2011; Remembering Character Actor Peter Hobbs - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> On August 29, 2011, the show returned to the lineup as the ''Three's Company'' cycle again came to the point of the series where the Ropers left.\n\nAntenna TV usually shows back-to-back episodes of ''Three's Company''.

It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Three's Company]]'' and loosely based on the [[British sitcom]] ''[[George and Mildred]]'', which was itself a spin-off of ''[[Man About the House]]'', on which ''Three's Company'' was based.\n\nIt was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] of [[Los Angeles]], where its parent series, ''Three's Company'', was taping at the time, from February to April 1979 (Season 1) and from July 1979 to February 1980 (Season 2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|title=Shows - CBS Television City|work=cbstelevisioncity.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focused on middle-aged couple [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] ([[Norman Fell]]) and [[Helen Roper]] ([[Audra Lindley]]), who were landlords to [[Jack Tripper|Jack]], [[Janet Wood|Janet]] and [[Chrissy Snow|Chrissy]] on ''Three's Company''.\n\nIn this spin-off, the Ropers have sold their apartment building in the ''Three's Company'' episode \"An Anniversary Surprise\" (season 3, episode 20) to live in the upmarket community of [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California|Cheviot Hills]], where the social-climbing Helen struggled to fit in with her neighbors. Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.\n\nAs was the case during their time on ''Three's Company'', opening credits for ''The Ropers'' alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell credited first.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Stanley Roper]]''' ([[Norman Fell]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles|Cheviot Hills]] after he is duped into buying a townhouse\n* '''[[Helen Roper]]''' ([[Audra Lindley]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A sexually frustrated, social-climbing middle-aged woman who tries to fit into the community despite her husband Stanley's constant boorishness.

In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the ''Three's Company'' producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show's continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by ''Three's Company's'' own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to [[NBC]]). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, ''Three's Company'' producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to ''Three's Company''. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.\n\nLike ''Three's Company'', ''The Ropers'' was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as ''Three's Company'' on ABC's successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10{{nbsp}}pm. In its first season, the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show were very high (the show finished at #8 for the 1978\u201379 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time.<ref name=ourdoor>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Chris |title=Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-16803-9|page=113}}</ref> After the season premiere, ''Three's Company'' went on hiatus, but ''The Ropers'' still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nAt the beginning of the 1979\u201380 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (#52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17\u201323, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show ''[[CHiPs]]''. The show later moved to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show wasn't pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show's cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30{{nbsp}}pm after ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann's 1997 book about ''Three's Company'' that she was surprised that ''The Ropers'' had been canceled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979\u201380 season at number 25<ref name=ourdoor/>; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' at number 25.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the series canceled, Fell approached ''Three's Company'' producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time ''The Ropers'' was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on ''Three's Company'' by Ralph Furley ([[Don Knotts]]). The addition had worked well and ''Three's Company'' had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original ''Three's Company'' roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980\u201381 television season that led to her departure from the series. The cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to ''Three's Company''. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.\n\nDespite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on ''Three's Company'' (in Season 5, Episode #18 \"Night of The Ropers\") nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good. For audiences, it was a chance to see all of the three landlord characters &ndash; played by Fell, Lindley, and Knotts &ndash; on the same stage.\n\nTambor appeared on ''Three's Company'' that same season playing a different character, a wealthy but unwelcome suitor of Chrissy's cousin Cindy (Season 5, Episode #13). Tambor also made other guest appearances on ''Three's Company,'' portraying different characters.\n\nThe show was ranked number two on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's \"Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1845866_1846026_1845969,00.html|title=The Ropers, 1979\u201380 \u2013 Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-12-30|date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002 ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''The Ropers'' the 49th worst TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse/page/181 181]}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed spin-off ==\nIn 1986, distributor D. L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spin-off of ''The Ropers'' called ''Three Apartments''. The spin-off would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include [[John Ritter]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Richard Kline]] and [[Don Knotts]] from ''Three's Company''; [[Robert Mandan]] from ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''; and [[Jim J. Bullock|Jm J. Bullock]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] from ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''/''The Ted Knight Show''. ''Three Apartments'' was to replace ''The Ted Knight Show'', a fellow Taffner-distributed show that ended production after the death of show namesake [[Ted Knight]] in August 1986.<ref name=\"Another3ForTaffner\">{{cite magazine |issn=0007-2028 |work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |department=Programing |title=Another 'Three' for Taffner |url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-10-20.pdf |location=Washington |volume=111 |number=16 |publication-date=October 20, 1986 |page=46}}</ref> The spin-off was withdrawn in January 1987 because of a glut of syndicated sitcom offerings, a lack of time slots, and a difficult advertising market.<ref name=\"BuyersMart\">{{cite newspaper |issn=0011-5509 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |volume=326 |number=1 |pages=1, 59 |title=Buyer's mart for syndie shows |given=John |surname=Dempsey |location=New Orleans, Louisiana}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=2| Season\n!

Two episodes of the series, however, play in the syndication package of ''Three's Company''. When initially offered in syndication, the series ran under the title '''''Three's Company's Friends, The Ropers'''''. That version used an instrumental version of the original series' theme song. Six episodes of the series were aired on [[TV Land]] in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on [[WGN America]] in October 2008.\n\nBeginning in January 2011 [[Antenna TV]], a television network designed for digital television subchannels and owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], aired the sitcom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/12/our-exclusive-interview-with-antenna.html|title=Our Exclusive Interview with Antenna TV's Sean Compton; KTLA Preview of Antenna TV; 2011 SAG Nominations - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> The series started on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, and went through one entire rotation of all episodes before being removed from the lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/01/antenna-tv-premieres-ropers-on-feb-15.html|title=Antenna TV Premieres The Ropers on Feb. 15, 2011; Remembering Character Actor Peter Hobbs - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> On August 29, 2011, the show returned to the lineup as the ''Three's Company'' cycle again came to the point of the series where the Ropers left.\n\nAntenna TV usually shows back-to-back episodes of ''Three's Company''.

In 1920, a girls' school was built there, and the surroundings were developed into a residential area.

Kabukich\u014d is the location of many [[host and hostess clubs]], [[love hotel]]s, shops, restaurants, and nightclubs, and is often called the \"Sleepless Town\" (\u7720\u3089\u306a\u3044\u8857).  [[Shinjuku Golden Gai]], famous for plethora of small bars, is part of Kabukicho.\n\nThe district's name comes from late-1940s plans to build a [[kabuki]] theater; although the theater was never built, the name stuck.\n\nThe area has many movie theaters, and is located near [[Shinjuku Station]], [[Seibu Shinjuku Station]], and several other major railway and subway stations.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kabukicho cropped GSI CKT20092-C62-15 20090427.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photograph (2009)]]\nOriginally, the area was known as {{nihongo|'''Tsunohazu'''|\u89d2\u7b48}} and was a swamp. After the [[Meiji Period]], the area became a duck sanctuary. As the Yodobashi Purification Plant was built in 1893, the ponds were filled in. In 1920, a girls' school was built there, and the surroundings were developed into a residential area. Prior to [[World War II]], the district was one of the areas open to foreign-born property owners (primarily from Taiwan and Korea), who mainly operated ''tsurekomi yado'', predecessors to today's [[love hotel]]s.<ref name=JT-2002/>\n\nDuring the war, a [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|bombing raid]] on April 13, 1945, razed the area to the ground.<ref name=JT-2002/> After the war, Kihei Suzuki from the Association of Readjustment and Reconstruction of Shinjuku worked with the major landowner, Mohei Minejima to draw up plans for Kiku-za, a kabuki theatre, in the area; they believed that performers from the [[Kabuki-za]] theatre in Ginza would accept their invitation to perform at Kiku-za.<ref name=JT-2002/> As a result, Hideaki Ishikawa, a regional planner,  dubbed the town Kabukich\u014d, which was adopted on April 1, 1948. Although the theatre was cancelled due to financial problems, the name remained.

Ever since his debut in ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'' his vocal effects were provided by co-creator William Hanna during the Hanna-Barbera era. Sara Berner also did vocal effects for Jerry in the short ''Baby Puss'' (1943) and voiced him in the short ''The Zoot Cat'' (1944), as well as ''Anchors Aweigh'' (1945) in a dance sequence with him and [[Gene Kelly]]. A sequence in the short ''The Milky Waif'' (1946) features Jerry and Nibbles disguising themselves as a pair of black people, in which the former is voiced by Lillian Randolph (same voice as [[Mammy Two Shoes]]). Paul Frees did Jerry's speaking voice in the shorts ''His Mouse Friday'' (1951) and ''Blue Cat Blues'' (1956). Daws Butler did Jerry's voice in the short ''Mucho Mouse'' (1957). When the [[MGM cartoon studio]] shut down in 1957, [[Gene Deitch]] and European animation studio [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt Studio]] took over, and Deitch did Jerry's voice during the 1961\u201362 era. During the [[Chuck Jones]] era in 1963\u20131967, his voice was provided by Mel Blanc, June Foray and Chuck Jones. Stan Freberg and Terence Monk did his voice in the short ''The Cat Above and the Mouse Below'' (1964) and Dale McKennon did Jerry\u2019s singing voice in ''Cat and Dupli-cat'' (1967). In ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975), Jerry was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in ''The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show'' (1980\u20131982). Frank Welker voiced him in ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' (1990\u20131993) and ''Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring'' (2002). Dana Hill voiced Jerry in ''Tom and Jerry: The Movie'' (1992).\n\nOther voice actors include Bill Kopp in ''Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars'' (2005) and ''Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry'' (2005), Spike Brandt in ''The Karate Guard'' (2005), ''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'' (2007), ''Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes'' (2010), ''Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse'' (2012), ''Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure'' (2013), ''Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon'' (2014), ''Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest'' (2015), and ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (2017), Bob Bergen ([[Porky Pig]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]'') in ''Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz'' (2011) and ''Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz'' (2016), Sam Vincent in ''Tom and Jerry Tales'' (2006\u20132008), Alan Marriott in ''Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry'' (2000) and ''Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers'' (2002), Marc Silk in ''Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers'' (2002; as Monster Jerry), and Jeff Bergman in a Cartoon Network Latin America bumper.

During the [[Chuck Jones]] era in 1963\u20131967, his voice was provided by Mel Blanc, June Foray and Chuck Jones. Stan Freberg and Terence Monk did his voice in the short ''The Cat Above and the Mouse Below'' (1964) and Dale McKennon did Jerry\u2019s singing voice in ''Cat and Dupli-cat'' (1967). In ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975), Jerry was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in ''The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show'' (1980\u20131982). Frank Welker voiced him in ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' (1990\u20131993) and ''Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring'' (2002).
