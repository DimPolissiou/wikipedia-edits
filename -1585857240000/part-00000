[[Kolkata]], in [[Kolkata district]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. One of the oldest neighbourhoods in [[South Kolkata]], Kalighat is also densely populated \u2014 with a history of cultural intermingling with the various foreign incursions into the area over time.\n\n==The Kali of Kalighat==\n[[File:Kalighat Temple, 1887.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kalighat Kali Temple]], 1887]]\nThe famous temple [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] dedicated to the goddess [[Kali]] is situated in Kalighat. This is one of the 51 [[Shakti Peethas]]. The right toe of [[Dakshayani]] [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]] is said to have fallen here. The [[Shakti]] here is known as ''Dakshina Kalika'', while the [[Bhairava]] is ''Nakulesh''. \nConsidered as one of the Holiest of the Holies in terms of Hindu [[Shaktism|Shakta]] Pilgrimage Centres, (Shiva and Durga/Kali/Shakti worshippers) it sees the footfall of thousands of devotees everyday. However, Tuesdays and Saturdays are considered very auspicious, and the crowd increases a hundred folds on these two days.\n\nThe special days when the Goddess receives even more pilgrims is during the ''Vipad Tarini Vrat'', and when the Goddess is worshipped as ''Ratantika'' and ''Falaaharini'' Kali.\n\n[[Image:Kalighat 1947.jpg|thumb|Pilgrims bathing in the Hoogly at Kalighat, c. 1947]]\n\n==Kalika Temple==\n[[File:Kalighat temple with bazzar.JPG|thumb|Kalighat Temple. Bazaar out the temple]]\nThe Medieval ''Bhuiyan'', Raja Basanta Ray, uncle of [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] and the King of Jessore, (now in [[Bangladesh]]) probably built the first Temple here. This temple was situated on the banks of river [[Adi Ganga]]. The Temple Complex is laid out in the following manner. The ''natmandir'', a hall attached to the ''[[Garbh Griha]]'' ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'' is in the southern wing while Shiva's temple is situated in the north-eastern wing. There is a temple dedicated to [[Radha Krishna]] built in 1843 by a [[zamindar]] of Bhaowali.\n\nThe Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in ''Mansar Bhasan'' composed in the 15th century, and in ''Kavi Kankan Mukunda Das''' ''Chandi Mangal'' of the 17th century. Mention of the Kali temple is also found in ''Lalmohon Bidyanidhi''s's \"''Sambanda Nirnoy''\".\n\nThe image of [[Kali]] in this temple is unique. It does not follow the pattern of other Kali images in Bengal. The present idol of touchstone was created by two saints -- '''''Atmaram Brahmachari''''' and '''''Brahmananda Giri'''''.\n\nHowever, the image here is older than what meets the eye. Originally thought to have been worshipped and created by the Hindu All-Father ''Brahma'', there are accounts from antiquity, which say that there was a mound or ''stupa'' here, which was called as ''Brahma'r Dhipi.'' And the image of the Kali here was present on the Dhipi or the mound, being worshipped regularly. Hundreds of years before Brahmananda GIri and Atmaram Brahmachari even reached this place. \n\nPresently, the mother goddess has three huge eyes, a long protruding tongue and four hands all of which are made of gold.\n\nThe hands of the goddess was originally made out of silver, and had been donated by Gokulchandra Ghoshal, the Diwan of the East India Company, who had been appointed to the post right after the Battle of Plassey. which had been later replaced by gold hands donated by a man named Kalicharan Mullick. The crown on the Devi's head had been donated by Ramnarayan Sarkar of Beleghata. The iconic golden tongue had been donated by Raja Indrachandra Shingho of Paikpara, and the Garland of heads that the goddess wears had been donated by the Maharaja of Patiala.  Nepal's former Army Chief had donated the Umbrella on top of the goddess' head. \n\nOut of the four hands, the top left hand holds a Kharga or a Scimitar, the bottom left holds a severed head of the Asura King ''Shumbha'', while the top right hand she shows the Abhay Mudra, and the bottom right hands she shows the Varada Mudra.\n\nWhilst the Scimitar signifies Divine Knowledge, the severed head of the Asura signifies the human Ego which has to be slain by the Divine Knowledge to attain Moksha or one's goal in life.\n\nThe Abhay Mudra signifies that the Goddess is always there with her devotees, protecting them from harm, while the Varada Mudra shows the benevolence and the soft-heartedness of the Devi, showering her devotees with divine and material blessings.\n\n[[File:Kalighat1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Kali]] idol at the [[Kalighat Kali Temple]]]]\nKalighat temple has references in 15th century texts. The original temple was a small hut. The present temple was built by the [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]] family of Barisha in 1809. They offered 595 bighas of land to the Temple deity so that worship and service could be continued smoothly. It is believed by some scholars that the name [[Calcutta]] was derived from Kalighat. Historically, traders halted at Kalighat to pay patronage to the goddess. The temple was initially on the banks of [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]]. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga, connecting to Hooghly. The present Dakshina Kali idol of touchstone was created in 1570 CE by two saints - Brahmananda Giri and Atmaram Giri based on the idol of Mata Bhuvaneshwari, the Kuladevi of [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]] family. It was Padmabati Devi, the mother of [[Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury]] who discovered the [[fossils]] of Sati's finger in a lake called [[Kalikunda]]. This made Kalighat as one of the 51 Shakti Pithas.<ref name = \"Katha\">''Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah'' by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication. {{ISBN|81-87648-36-8}}</ref>\n\n==Panchannagram and Kali-Kshetra==\nThe [[East India Company]] obtained from the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Farrukhsiyar]], in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]] in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of [[Siraj-ud-daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab of Bengal]], it purchased these villages in 1758 from [[Mir Jafar]], and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as ''[[Dihi Panchannagram]]'' and Kalighat was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the [[Maratha Ditch]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1916_PART_A_DCHB_KOLKATA.pdf |title = District Census Handbook Kolkata, Census of India 2011, Series 20, Part XII A |work = Pages 6-10: The History | publisher= Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal| accessdate = 20 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Cotton, H.E.A., ''Calcutta Old and New'', first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

Not knowing what to do with it, he sold it off to Raja [[Nabakrishna Deb]], Zamindar of [[Shovabazar]]-[[Sutanuti]].\n\nSeeing the coins as an opportunity of gaining confidence with the then [[Governor General of India]], [[Warren Hastings]], Nabakrishna Deb gifted him with the coins.\n\nKeeping a few with him, Warren Hastings sent 172 coins from the horde to London, to the [[East India Company]]. \n\nThese coins belonged to the Gupta Kings, testaments to India's glorious past, but since no one knew of the Guptas back then (It would not be before another half a century or so that Alexander Cunningham would find out about the glorious age of the [[Guptas]]), these coins held little value to the people involved.\n \nHowever, for all practical purposes, the hoard was thought to be lost, as the Company directors sent most of the coins to the melting pot, and some to a few collectors. When Hastings returned to London, he found only 24 of them in the collection of the British Museum. This astonished him beyond measures. He thought he had made a magnificent contribution to the Court of Directors \u2014 a hoard of [[Persian Darics]] (since no one knew of the Guptas back then).\n\nIn 1825, Marsden prepared the ''Nusmiamata Orientalia'', where for the first time they were mentioned as Gupta coins.\n\nThe coins had been placed in a brass pot that remained submerged in water for a long time, hence the coins developed an underwater patina of clayish black, owing to the reaction of the gold and the alloys in the coin with the alluvium. \n\nThe hoard contained the [[Archer Type]] coins from the reign of [[Chandragupta II]] who had probably annexed Bengal to his Empire, and [[Kumaragupta I]] with an abundance in coins from the reign of [[Vishnugupta (Gupta Empire)|Vishnugupta]] and [[Narasimhagupta]], besides a few from the times of [[Shashanka]], a later but important Ruler of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]].\n\nThis is the largest hoard of Gupta coins ever found in the history of India.\n\n==The Kalighat Temple as a Shakti Peeth==\n{{main|Daksha Yaga|Shakti Peethas}}\n[[File:Dakshayani.jpg|thumb|Shiva carrying the corpse of [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] Devi]]\nThe Temple at Kalighat is revered as an important [[Shakti Peetha]],  by the [[Shaktism]] sect of Hinduism. ''The mythology of [[Daksha yajna]] and Sati's self immolation'' is the story behind the origin of Shakti Peethas.\n\n[[Daksha]], the son of [[Brahma]] was an ancient entity called [[Prajapati]] or the keeper of the beings in Hinduism. He had a lot of daughters, one of whom was [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]], an incarnation of the Primordial Mother Goddess or [[Shakti]]. She was married to [[Shiva]], the ascetic, whose abode was in the cold and snowy recesses of the [[Kailasa Parvat]]. Daksha had frowned upon the marriage, as Shiva was a penniless man, quite unlike the King that Daksha was. In time, Daksha decided that he would arrange a [[yajna]] or a ritual where he would invite all the gods, except for Shiva. Sati, his daughter came to her father's place, uninvited and faced a flurry of insults from her father about her husband. Unable to bear the insults, she immolated herself. The news of the death of his beloved wife set Shiva on a delirious rage, as he started the [[Tandav]] or the Dance of Destruction with the body of Sati, calming down, only when Vishnu managed to chop her body down into fifty one pieces, which would fall all over the length and breadth of [[India]]. (A lot of these places are in modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] as well.)\n\n[[Shakti Peethas]] or divine seats of [[Shakti]] or the Primordial Mother Goddess, thus came into being wherever these severed parts of Sati's body had fallen.\n\nEach of the 51 Peethas have a temple dedicated to the [[Shakti]] or the Primordial Mother, and a temple dedicated to the [[Bhairava]] or Shiva, the All-Father, essentially forming important historical centres to mark the marriage of [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]], and also the philosophical fact that a man is nothing without his Shakti or Woman and vice versa.\n\nThe Shakti here is thus ''Dakshina [[Kali]]'' (the benevolent Mother of the World) while the Bhairav being ''Nakulish'' or ''Nakuleshwar''.\n\nIt is believed that the '''RIGHT TOES''' of Sati fell here at '''KALIGHAT'''. However, some Puranas also mention that the ''MUKHA KHANDA'' or the ''FACE'' of the Goddess fell here, got fossilized, and is stored and worshipped here.\n\nThe 51 Shakti Peethas are linked to the 51 alphabets in [[Sanskrit]], each carrying the power to invoke one of the goddesses associated with them. These Alphabets are called ''Veej Mantras'' or the seeds of the primordial sounds of creation. The Veej Mantra for ''Dakshina [[Kali]]'' is ''Kring''.\n\nThe mythological texts which include the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti,) recognize the four major Shakti Peethas -- [[Bimala]] where resides the ''Pada Khanda'' (feet) (the temple is inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha), [[Tara Tarini]] housing the ''Stana Khanda'' (Breasts), (near Brahmapur, Odisha), [[Kamakshya]], ''Yoni khanda'' (vagina) (near Guwahati, Assam) and [[Dakshina Kalika]], ''Mukha khanda'' (in Kolkata, West Bengal) originated from the lifeless body of the goddess Sati.\n\nThis is illustrated in a hymn from the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti):\n\n'''\u201cVimala Pada khandancha,\n\nStana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini),\n\nKamakhya Yoni khandancha,\n\nMukha khandancha Kalika (Kali)\n\nAnga pratyanga sangena\n\nVishnu Chakra Kshate nacha\u2026\u2026\u201d\n'''\n\nFurther explaining the importance of these four Peethas the Brihat Samhita gives the geographical location of these Peethas. For example:\n\n''\u201cRushikulya Tate Devi,\n\nTarakashya Mahagiri,\n\nTashya Srunge Stitha Tara,\n\nVasishta Rajitapara\"''\n\nThus, there is no dispute regarding these four Adi Shakti Peethas and their locations. These four Peethas are also believed as the most powerful Shakti Peethas in [[Bharata Varsha]]. However, all these Four Adi Shakti Peethas are also part of 51 Shakti Peethas but there are four major parts of Devi Sati's body so they are important, powerful and believed as Adi Shakti Peethas.\n\n==Kalika's image==\nThe image of the deity is incomplete. Only the face of the deity was made first. The hands, made of gold and silver, the tongue, the Shiva statue and all the jewellery were added over the years. On [[snanyatra]] day, while giving the divine Mother the ceremonial bath, the priests tie their eyes with cloth coverings. On auspicious occasions like [[Kali Puja]], [[Durga Puja]], [[Poila Boishakh]], the Bengali New Year day and [[sankranti]] large number of devotees throng the place with offerings.\n\n==Adi Ganga==\nKalighat  was a Ghat (landing stage) sacred to Kali on the old course of the Hooghly river (Bh\u0101girathi). The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hoogly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hoogly (the Ganges). Hence the name Adi (original) Ganges.\n\n==Kalighat painting==\n{{Main|Kalighat painting}}\n[[File:The demon ravana fighting with the ape hanuman, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|upright|Ravana and Hanuman, Kalighat school of painting, c1880]]\nKalighat painting, or ''pata'' (originally pronounced 'pot' in Bengali) is a style of [[Indian painting]] derives its name from the place. It is characterised by generously curving figures of both men and women and an earthy satirical style. It developed during the nineteenth century in response to the sudden prosperity brought to Calcutta by the East India Company trade, whereby many houses including that of 'Prince' [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], grandfather of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] became incredibly wealthy. Many of these [[nouveau riche]] families came from not particular exalted [[caste]] backgrounds, so the orthodox tended to frown on them and their often very tasteless [[conspicuous consumption]]. To the common people the [[Babu (title)|babu]]s, as they were called, were equally objects of fun and sources of income. Thus the 'babu culture' portrayed in the Kalighat patas often shows inversions of the social order (wives beating husbands or leading them about in the guise of pet goats or dogs, maidservants wearing shoes, sahibs in undignified postures, domestic contretemps, and the like.) They also showed European innovations (babus wearing European clothes, smoking pipes, reading at desks, etc.). The object of this is only partly satirical; it also expresses the wonder that ordinary Bengalis felt on exposure to these new and curious ways and objects.\n\nKalighat pata pictures are highly stylised, do not use perspective, are usually pen and ink line drawings filled in with flat bright colours and normally use paper as a substrate, though some may be found with cloth backing or on cloth. The artists were rarely educated, and usually came from a lineage of artisans. Kalighat patas are still made today although genuine work is hard to come by. The art form is urban and largely secular: although gods and goddesses are often depicted, they appear in much the same de-romanticised way as the humans do. By contrast, the Orissa tradition of pata-painting, centering on Puri, is consciously devotional. Kalighat pata has been credited with influencing the [[Bengal School]] of art associated with [[Jamini Roy]].\n\n==Kalighat in fiction==\n[[Amitav Ghosh]]'s [[The Calcutta Chromosome]] is partly set in Kalighat and gives a wonderfully atmospheric depiction of the region as well as the city itself.\n\nKalighat also plays a prominent role in [[Song of Kali]] by [[Dan Simmons]] and in the short story [[Calcutta, Lord of Nerves]] by [[Poppy Z. Brite]].\nIt also features in the movie [[Kahaani]] starring [[Vidya Balan]] and directed by [[Sujoy Ghosh]].\n\n==Police district==\nKalighat police station is part of the [[Divisions of Kolkata Police|South division]] of [[Kolkata Police]].

[[Kolkata]], in [[Kolkata district]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. One of the oldest neighbourhoods in [[South Kolkata]], Kalighat is also densely populated \u2014 with a history of cultural intermingling with the various foreign incursions into the area over time.\n\n==The Kali of Kalighat==\n[[File:Kalighat Temple, 1887.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kalighat Kali Temple]], 1887]]\nThe famous temple [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] dedicated to the goddess [[Kali]] is situated in Kalighat. This is one of the 51 [[Shakti Peethas]]. The right toe of [[Dakshayani]] [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]] is said to have fallen here. The [[Shakti]] here is known as ''Dakshina Kalika'', while the [[Bhairava]] is ''Nakulesh''. \nConsidered as one of the Holiest of the Holies in terms of Hindu [[Shaktism|Shakta]] Pilgrimage Centres, (Shiva and Durga/Kali/Shakti worshippers) it sees the footfall of thousands of devotees everyday. However, Tuesdays and Saturdays are considered very auspicious, and the crowd increases a hundred folds on these two days.\n\nThe special days when the Goddess receives even more pilgrims is during the ''Vipad Tarini Vrat'', and when the Goddess is worshipped as ''Ratantika'' and ''Falaaharini'' Kali.\n\n[[Image:Kalighat 1947.jpg|thumb|Pilgrims bathing in the Hoogly at Kalighat, c. 1947]]\n\n==Kalika Temple==\n[[File:Kalighat temple with bazzar.JPG|thumb|Kalighat Temple. Bazaar out the temple]]\nThe Medieval ''Bhuiyan'', Raja Basanta Ray, uncle of [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] and the King of Jessore, (now in [[Bangladesh]]) probably built the first Temple here. This temple was situated on the banks of river [[Adi Ganga]]. The Temple Complex is laid out in the following manner. The ''natmandir'', a hall attached to the ''[[Garbh Griha]]'' ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'' is in the southern wing while Shiva's temple is situated in the north-eastern wing. There is a temple dedicated to [[Radha Krishna]] built in 1843 by a [[zamindar]] of Bhaowali.\n\nThe Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in ''Mansar Bhasan'' composed in the 15th century, and in ''Kavi Kankan Mukunda Das''' ''Chandi Mangal'' of the 17th century. Mention of the Kali temple is also found in ''Lalmohon Bidyanidhi''s's \"''Sambanda Nirnoy''\".\n\nThe image of [[Kali]] in this temple is unique. It does not follow the pattern of other Kali images in Bengal. The present idol of touchstone was created by two saints -- '''''Atmaram Brahmachari''''' and '''''Brahmananda Giri'''''.\n\nHowever, the image here is older than what meets the eye. Originally thought to have been worshipped and created by the Hindu All-Father ''Brahma'', there are accounts from antiquity, which say that there was a mound or ''stupa'' here, which was called as ''Brahma'r Dhipi.'' And the image of the Kali here was present on the Dhipi or the mound, being worshipped regularly. Hundreds of years before Brahmananda GIri and Atmaram Brahmachari even reached this place. \n\nPresently, the mother goddess has three huge eyes, a long protruding tongue and four hands all of which are made of gold.\n\nThe hands of the goddess was originally made out of silver, and had been donated by Gokulchandra Ghoshal, the Diwan of the East India Company, who had been appointed to the post right after the Battle of Plassey. which had been later replaced by gold hands donated by a man named Kalicharan Mullick. The crown on the Devi's head had been donated by Ramnarayan Sarkar of Beleghata. The iconic golden tongue had been donated by Raja Indrachandra Shingho of Paikpara, and the Garland of heads that the goddess wears had been donated by the Maharaja of Patiala.  Nepal's former Army Chief had donated the Umbrella on top of the goddess' head. \n\nOut of the four hands, the top left hand holds a Kharga or a Scimitar, the bottom left holds a severed head of the Asura King ''Shumbha'', while the top right hand she shows the Abhay Mudra, and the bottom right hands she shows the Varada Mudra.\n\nWhilst the Scimitar signifies Divine Knowledge, the severed head of the Asura signifies the human Ego which has to be slain by the Divine Knowledge to attain Moksha or one's goal in life.\n\nThe Abhay Mudra signifies that the Goddess is always there with her devotees, protecting them from harm, while the Varada Mudra shows the benevolence and the soft-heartedness of the Devi, showering her devotees with divine and material blessings.\n\n[[File:Kalighat1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Kali]] idol at the [[Kalighat Kali Temple]]]]\nKalighat temple has references in 15th century texts. The original temple was a small hut. The present temple was built by the [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]] family of Barisha in 1809. They offered 595 bighas of land to the Temple deity so that worship and service could be continued smoothly. It is believed by some scholars that the name [[Calcutta]] was derived from Kalighat. Historically, traders halted at Kalighat to pay patronage to the goddess. The temple was initially on the banks of [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]]. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga, connecting to Hooghly. The present Dakshina Kali idol of touchstone was created in 1570 CE by two saints - Brahmananda Giri and Atmaram Giri based on the idol of Mata Bhuvaneshwari, the Kuladevi of [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]] family. It was Padmabati Devi, the mother of [[Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury]] who discovered the [[fossils]] of Sati's finger in a lake called [[Kalikunda]]. This made Kalighat as one of the 51 Shakti Pithas.<ref name = \"Katha\">''Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah'' by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication. {{ISBN|81-87648-36-8}}</ref>\n\n==Panchannagram and Kali-Kshetra==\nThe [[East India Company]] obtained from the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Farrukhsiyar]], in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]] in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of [[Siraj-ud-daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab of Bengal]], it purchased these villages in 1758 from [[Mir Jafar]], and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as ''[[Dihi Panchannagram]]'' and Kalighat was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the [[Maratha Ditch]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1916_PART_A_DCHB_KOLKATA.pdf |title = District Census Handbook Kolkata, Census of India 2011, Series 20, Part XII A |work = Pages 6-10: The History | publisher= Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal| accessdate = 20 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Cotton, H.E.A., ''Calcutta Old and New'', first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

Not knowing what to do with it, he sold it off to Raja [[Nabakrishna Deb]], Zamindar of [[Shovabazar]]-[[Sutanuti]].\n\nSeeing the coins as an opportunity of gaining confidence with the then [[Governor General of India]], [[Warren Hastings]], Nabakrishna Deb gifted him with the coins.\n\nKeeping a few with him, Warren Hastings sent 172 coins from the horde to London, to the [[East India Company]]. \n\nThese coins belonged to the Gupta Kings, testaments to India's glorious past, but since no one knew of the Guptas back then (It would not be before another half a century or so that Alexander Cunningham would find out about the glorious age of the [[Guptas]]), these coins held little value to the people involved.\n \nHowever, for all practical purposes, the hoard was thought to be lost, as the Company directors sent most of the coins to the melting pot, and some to a few collectors. When Hastings returned to London, he found only 24 of them in the collection of the British Museum. This astonished him beyond measures. He thought he had made a magnificent contribution to the Court of Directors \u2014 a hoard of [[Persian Darics]] (since no one knew of the Guptas back then).\n\nIn 1825, Marsden prepared the ''Nusmiamata Orientalia'', where for the first time they were mentioned as Gupta coins.\n\nThe coins had been placed in a brass pot that remained submerged in water for a long time, hence the coins developed an underwater patina of clayish black, owing to the reaction of the gold and the alloys in the coin with the alluvium. \n\nThe hoard contained the [[Archer Type]] coins from the reign of [[Chandragupta II]] who had probably annexed Bengal to his Empire, and [[Kumaragupta I]] with an abundance in coins from the reign of [[Vishnugupta (Gupta Empire)|Vishnugupta]] and [[Narasimhagupta]], besides a few from the times of [[Shashanka]], a later but important Ruler of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]].\n\nThis is the largest hoard of Gupta coins ever found in the history of India.\n\n==The Kalighat Temple as a Shakti Peeth==\n{{main|Daksha Yaga|Shakti Peethas}}\n[[File:Dakshayani.jpg|thumb|Shiva carrying the corpse of [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] Devi]]\nThe Temple at Kalighat is revered as an important [[Shakti Peetha]],  by the [[Shaktism]] sect of Hinduism. ''The mythology of [[Daksha yajna]] and Sati's self immolation'' is the story behind the origin of Shakti Peethas.\n\n[[Daksha]], the son of [[Brahma]] was an ancient entity called [[Prajapati]] or the keeper of the beings in Hinduism. He had a lot of daughters, one of whom was [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]], an incarnation of the Primordial Mother Goddess or [[Shakti]]. She was married to [[Shiva]], the ascetic, whose abode was in the cold and snowy recesses of the [[Kailasa Parvat]]. Daksha had frowned upon the marriage, as Shiva was a penniless man, quite unlike the King that Daksha was. In time, Daksha decided that he would arrange a [[yajna]] or a ritual where he would invite all the gods, except for Shiva. Sati, his daughter came to her father's place, uninvited and faced a flurry of insults from her father about her husband. Unable to bear the insults, she immolated herself. The news of the death of his beloved wife set Shiva on a delirious rage, as he started the [[Tandav]] or the Dance of Destruction with the body of Sati, calming down, only when Vishnu managed to chop her body down into fifty one pieces, which would fall all over the length and breadth of [[India]]. (A lot of these places are in modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] as well.)\n\n[[Shakti Peethas]] or divine seats of [[Shakti]] or the Primordial Mother Goddess, thus came into being wherever these severed parts of Sati's body had fallen.\n\nEach of the 51 Peethas have a temple dedicated to the [[Shakti]] or the Primordial Mother, and a temple dedicated to the [[Bhairava]] or Shiva, the All-Father, essentially forming important historical centres to mark the marriage of [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]], and also the philosophical fact that a man is nothing without his Shakti or Woman and vice versa.\n\nThe Shakti here is thus ''Dakshina [[Kali]]'' (the benevolent Mother of the World) while the Bhairav being ''Nakulish'' or ''Nakuleshwar''.\n\nIt is believed that the '''RIGHT TOES''' of Sati fell here at '''KALIGHAT'''. However, some Puranas also mention that the ''MUKHA KHANDA'' or the ''FACE'' of the Goddess fell here, got fossilized, and is stored and worshipped here.\n\nThe 51 Shakti Peethas are linked to the 51 alphabets in [[Sanskrit]], each carrying the power to invoke one of the goddesses associated with them. These Alphabets are called ''Veej Mantras'' or the seeds of the primordial sounds of creation. The Veej Mantra for ''Dakshina [[Kali]]'' is ''Kring''.\n\nThe mythological texts which include the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti,) recognize the four major Shakti Peethas -- [[Bimala]] where resides the ''Pada Khanda'' (feet) (the temple is inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha), [[Tara Tarini]] housing the ''Stana Khanda'' (Breasts), (near Brahmapur, Odisha), [[Kamakshya]], ''Yoni khanda'' (vagina) (near Guwahati, Assam) and [[Dakshina Kalika]], ''Mukha khanda'' (in Kolkata, West Bengal) originated from the lifeless body of the goddess Sati.\n\nThis is illustrated in a hymn from the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti):\n\n'''\u201cVimala Pada khandancha,\n\nStana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini),\n\nKamakhya Yoni khandancha,\n\nMukha khandancha Kalika (Kali)\n\nAnga pratyanga sangena\n\nVishnu Chakra Kshate nacha\u2026\u2026\u201d\n'''\n\nFurther explaining the importance of these four Peethas the Brihat Samhita gives the geographical location of these Peethas. For example:\n\n''\u201cRushikulya Tate Devi,\n\nTarakashya Mahagiri,\n\nTashya Srunge Stitha Tara,\n\nVasishta Rajitapara\"''\n\nThus, there is no dispute regarding these four Adi Shakti Peethas and their locations. These four Peethas are also believed as the most powerful Shakti Peethas in [[Bharata Varsha]]. However, all these Four Adi Shakti Peethas are also part of 51 Shakti Peethas but there are four major parts of Devi Sati's body so they are important, powerful and believed as Adi Shakti Peethas.\n\n==Kalika's image==\nThe image of the deity is incomplete. Only the face of the deity was made first. The hands, made of gold and silver, the tongue, the Shiva statue and all the jewellery were added over the years. On [[snanyatra]] day, while giving the divine Mother the ceremonial bath, the priests tie their eyes with cloth coverings. On auspicious occasions like [[Kali Puja]], [[Durga Puja]], [[Poila Boishakh]], the Bengali New Year day and [[sankranti]] large number of devotees throng the place with offerings.\n\n==Adi Ganga==\nKalighat  was a Ghat (landing stage) sacred to Kali on the old course of the Hooghly river (Bh\u0101girathi). The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hoogly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hoogly (the Ganges). Hence the name Adi (original) Ganges.\n\n==Kalighat painting==\n{{Main|Kalighat painting}}\n[[File:The demon ravana fighting with the ape hanuman, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|upright|Ravana and Hanuman, Kalighat school of painting, c1880]]\nKalighat painting, or ''pata'' (originally pronounced 'pot' in Bengali) is a style of [[Indian painting]] derives its name from the place. It is characterised by generously curving figures of both men and women and an earthy satirical style. It developed during the nineteenth century in response to the sudden prosperity brought to Calcutta by the East India Company trade, whereby many houses including that of 'Prince' [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], grandfather of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] became incredibly wealthy. Many of these [[nouveau riche]] families came from not particular exalted [[caste]] backgrounds, so the orthodox tended to frown on them and their often very tasteless [[conspicuous consumption]]. To the common people the [[Babu (title)|babu]]s, as they were called, were equally objects of fun and sources of income. Thus the 'babu culture' portrayed in the Kalighat patas often shows inversions of the social order (wives beating husbands or leading them about in the guise of pet goats or dogs, maidservants wearing shoes, sahibs in undignified postures, domestic contretemps, and the like.) They also showed European innovations (babus wearing European clothes, smoking pipes, reading at desks, etc.). The object of this is only partly satirical; it also expresses the wonder that ordinary Bengalis felt on exposure to these new and curious ways and objects.\n\nKalighat pata pictures are highly stylised, do not use perspective, are usually pen and ink line drawings filled in with flat bright colours and normally use paper as a substrate, though some may be found with cloth backing or on cloth. The artists were rarely educated, and usually came from a lineage of artisans. Kalighat patas are still made today although genuine work is hard to come by. The art form is urban and largely secular: although gods and goddesses are often depicted, they appear in much the same de-romanticised way as the humans do. By contrast, the Orissa tradition of pata-painting, centering on Puri, is consciously devotional. Kalighat pata has been credited with influencing the [[Bengal School]] of art associated with [[Jamini Roy]].\n\n==Kalighat in fiction==\n[[Amitav Ghosh]]'s [[The Calcutta Chromosome]] is partly set in Kalighat and gives a wonderfully atmospheric depiction of the region as well as the city itself.\n\nKalighat also plays a prominent role in [[Song of Kali]] by [[Dan Simmons]] and in the short story [[Calcutta, Lord of Nerves]] by [[Poppy Z. Brite]].\nIt also features in the movie [[Kahaani]] starring [[Vidya Balan]] and directed by [[Sujoy Ghosh]].\n\n==Police district==\nKalighat police station is part of the [[Divisions of Kolkata Police|South division]] of [[Kolkata Police]].

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

On 21 and 22 April in Los Angeles, May was in the studio with [[Eddie Van Halen]], with no intentions of recording anything; the result of those days was a mini album entitled ''[[Star Fleet Project]]'', which originally wasn't going to be released. In 1986, May contributed to former [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] guitarist [[Steve Hackett]]'s album ''[[Feedback 86]]'', playing guitar on the track \"Cassandra\" and providing guitar and vocals for \"Slot Machine,\" the latter co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. In the same year, May worked with actress [[Anita Dobson]] on her first album, most noted for the song \"Anyone Can Fall in Love\", which added lyrics to the ''[[EastEnders]]'' theme tune and reached no. 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 1986. May and Dobson would go on to marry in 2000.<ref>\"Anita Dobson and Brian May surprise wedding\".

A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' and won the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song Musically & Lyrically in 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Billboard|author=Nigel Hunter|title=Anniversaries Abound at Novello Awards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=21 June 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=48}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1992, [[the Brian May Band]] was officially formed. An earlier version of the band was loosely formed for 19 October 1991, the date of the band's last concert of reunion, when May took part in the ''Guitar Legends'' guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band lasted only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on only five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology (2nd Edition)|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made was in the backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18 December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band, with a new drummer being needed at short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording drums and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced Steve Ferrone for the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132004===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\", \"Chinese Torture\"), [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"), [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), [[Greco guitars|Greco]] BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |title=Guitar Builder (Luthier) in East Anglia, UK \u2013 High Quality Hand Made Custom Electric Guitars by Andrew Guyton |publisher=Guytonguitars.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025707/http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n*July 1973&nbsp;\u2013 May 1974: [[Fender Stratocaster]] CBS era (thought to be a 1972)\n*October 1974&nbsp;\u2013 May 1975: [[Gibson Les Paul]] Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.\n*November 1975&nbsp;\u2013 May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.\n*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for \"'39\".\n*January 1977&nbsp;\u2013 August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (\"'39\", \"Love of My Life\", \"Dreamer's Ball\").\n*November 1979&nbsp;\u2013 June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), [[Fender Telecaster]] (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).\n*July&nbsp;\u2013 November 1982: Added a [[Gibson Flying V]] as second back-up. On 9 August 1982 May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying&nbsp;V became the only spare.\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor's Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.\n*July 1985&nbsp;\u2013 August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same.\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings. He used this guitar at a few gigs with [[Adam Lambert]] now being able to play the 12-string part from the studio version of \"Under Pressure\" live.<ref name=\"Double-neck Red Special\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/brian-mays-guyton-double-neck-549856|title=Brian May's Guyton Double Neck|author=Simon Bradley|publisher=Musicradar.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe currently has a Guild 12-string to replace his Ovation Pacemaker. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976) and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979). It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

January 2014)</ref> His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |title=Vox AC30 Brian May |publisher=Brianmaycentral.net |accessdate=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029011512/http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |archivedate=29 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137&nbsp;dB. He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

In 1986, May contributed to former [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] guitarist [[Steve Hackett]]'s album ''[[Feedback 86]]'', playing guitar on the track \"Cassandra\" and providing guitar and vocals for \"Slot Machine,\" the latter co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. In the same year, May worked with actress [[Anita Dobson]] on her first album, most noted for the song \"Anyone Can Fall in Love\", which added lyrics to the ''[[EastEnders]]'' theme tune and reached no. 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 1986.

Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.\"<ref name=\"Jackson2011\"/> ''Back to the Light'' featured the single \"[[Too Much Love Will Kill You]]\", on which he collaborated as a songwriter with [[Frank Musker]] and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' and won the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song Musically & Lyrically in 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Billboard|author=Nigel Hunter|title=Anniversaries Abound at Novello Awards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=21 June 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=48}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1992, [[the Brian May Band]] was officially formed. An earlier version of the band was loosely formed for 19 October 1991, the date of the band's last concert of reunion, when May took part in the ''Guitar Legends'' guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band lasted only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on only five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology (2nd Edition)|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made was in the backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18 December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band, with a new drummer being needed at short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording drums and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced Steve Ferrone for the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132004===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\", \"Chinese Torture\"), [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"), [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), [[Greco guitars|Greco]] BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |title=Guitar Builder (Luthier) in East Anglia, UK \u2013 High Quality Hand Made Custom Electric Guitars by Andrew Guyton |publisher=Guytonguitars.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025707/http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n*July 1973&nbsp;\u2013 May 1974: [[Fender Stratocaster]] CBS era (thought to be a 1972)\n*October 1974&nbsp;\u2013 May 1975: [[Gibson Les Paul]] Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.\n*November 1975&nbsp;\u2013 May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.\n*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for \"'39\".\n*January 1977&nbsp;\u2013 August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (\"'39\", \"Love of My Life\", \"Dreamer's Ball\").\n*November 1979&nbsp;\u2013 June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), [[Fender Telecaster]] (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).\n*July&nbsp;\u2013 November 1982: Added a [[Gibson Flying V]] as second back-up. On 9 August 1982 May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying&nbsp;V became the only spare.\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor's Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.\n*July 1985&nbsp;\u2013 August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same.\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings. He used this guitar at a few gigs with [[Adam Lambert]] now being able to play the 12-string part from the studio version of \"Under Pressure\" live.<ref name=\"Double-neck Red Special\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/brian-mays-guyton-double-neck-549856|title=Brian May's Guyton Double Neck|author=Simon Bradley|publisher=Musicradar.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe currently has a Guild 12-string to replace his Ovation Pacemaker. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976) and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979). It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

January 2014)</ref> His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |title=Vox AC30 Brian May |publisher=Brianmaycentral.net |accessdate=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029011512/http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |archivedate=29 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137&nbsp;dB. He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

[[iTunes]] does not support FLAC, with Apple only offering native support for their own similar [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] lossless audio format. Third party applications are available in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] which enable FLAC playback.\n\n[[iOS jailbreaking|Jailbroken]] iOS devices could play it through the applications from [[Cydia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- blog's http://vlc4iphone.blogspot.com not allowed, find another reputable source -->\n\n==== macOS ====\nAs with their iOS operating system, Apple's iTunes software on macOS  cannot natively playback FLAC audio files. One exception to this is with the use of a third-party software plug-in, which currently allows iTunes software to playback a small percentage of [[Ogg]]-based FLAC files. Computers that run on the [[MacOS High Sierra]] operating can play Flac files via preview.app . Older versions require third-party non-iTunes media players in order to playback FLAC files, or to encode into FLAC files.\n\n=== Android ===\nNative support for FLAC was added to the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] starting from the '''3.1''' 'Honeycomb' update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html |title=Android Supported Media Formats |date=4 August 2011 |work=Andro Med Formats |accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref> The feature came about after much public discussion on Android's [[Google Code]] development site.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1461\n|title=Issue 1461&nbsp;\u2013 android&nbsp;\u2013 FLAC file support enhancement request. |work=code.google.com |accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref> However, FLAC support is limited to .FLAC files as Android does not support decode inside of other file containers (such as MP4 and MKV).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html\n|title= Android Developer's Supported Media Formats |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the Android 3.1 update, Samsung included native support on over 32 Android devices, including their [[Samsung Galaxy|Galaxy]] line of phones.<ref name=\"GSM Arena\">[http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sFreeText=flac \"FLAC\" Phone Finder results - GSMArena.com]</ref> In addition, other prior Android device users could only (and still today) resort to using third-party applications (apps) available for Android such as PowerAMP, andLess, Astro Player or otherwise alternatively turn to installing custom system ROMs such as [[CyanogenMod]].

One exception to this is with the use of a third-party software plug-in, which currently allows iTunes software to playback a small percentage of [[Ogg]]-based FLAC files.

The phenomenon has been studied especially in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], as well as in continental [[Europe]]. Thus nativism has become a general term for [[opposition to immigration]] based on fears that immigrants will \"distort or spoil\" existing [[cultural values]].<ref>{{cite|first=Joel S.|last=Fetzer|title=Economic self-interest or cultural marginality?

When the separate Australian colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new nation adopted \"[[White Australia policy|White Australia]]\" as one of its founding principles. Under the White Australia policy, entry of Chinese and other Asians remained controversial until well [[Post-war|after World War II]], although the country remained home to many long-established Chinese families dating from before the adoption of White Australia. By contrast, most [[Pacific Islander]]s were deported soon after the policy was adopted, while the remainder were forced out of the canefields where they had worked for decades.<ref>After 1905, 4000 \"Kanakas\" were repatriated and the remaining 2500 were pushed out of the canefields by labour unions.\nDoug Munro, \"The Labor Trade in Melanesians to Queensland: An Historiographic Essay,\" ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 28, No. 3 (Spring, 1995), pp. 609\u201327</ref>\n\nAntipathy of native-born white Australians toward British and Irish immigrants in the late 19th century was manifested in a new party, the [[Australian Natives' Association]].<ref name=\"Richard Jensen 2009\"/><ref>Charles S.

The country encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration always faced considerable backlash. On July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: \"The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited.\" On October 22, 1923, representative Fid\u00e9lis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: \"The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country.(...)\".<ref name=\"rios\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808044737/http://www.movimentoafro.amazonida.com/branqueamento.htm RIOS, Roger Raupp. Text excerpted from a judicial sentence concerning crime of racism.

Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: \"They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble\". The Brazilian magazine \"O Malho\" in its edition of December 5, 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: \"The government of S\u00e3o Paulo is stubborn.

In fact, there were violent revolts in the Japanese community of the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] when [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] declared that Japan surrendered and he was not a deity, which was thought as a conspiracy trying to hurt Japanese honor and strength. Nevertheless, it followed hostility from the government. The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without [[safe conduct]] issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco Am\u00e9rica do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations because of \"activities against national security\" arising from disagreements between neighbours, recovery of debts and even fights between children.<ref name=\"suzuki\"/> Japanese Brazilians were arrested for \"suspicious activity\" when they were in artistic meetings or [[picnic]]s. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in [[Santos (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Santos]] had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in [[Baixada Santista]], the Japanese had to have a safe conduct.<ref name=\"suzuki\"/> In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in [[Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u]], in [[Par\u00e1]], was virtually turned into a \"concentration camp\" (expression of the time) from which no Japanese could leave. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to \"internment camps\" without the need for legal support, in the same manner [[Japanese American internment|as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States]].

Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism.\n\nOnce Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of [[Trade union|unionism]] and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as [[strikebreaker]]s, integration was open for most Italian immigrants.

In this context \"Native\" does not mean [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture. Nativists objected primarily to [[Irish Catholic|Irish Roman Catholics]] because of their loyalty to the [[Pope]] and also because of their supposed rejection of [[republicanism]] as an American ideal.<ref>Ray A.

In 1836, [[Samuel Morse]] ran unsuccessfully for [[Mayor of New York City]] on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes.

It was at this time that the term \"nativist\" first appears, opponents denounced them as \"bigoted nativists.\" Former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]] ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856. The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called \"nativists.\"<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s''</ref>\n\nThis form of [[nationalism]] is often identified with [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment (anti-Papism). In [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], a nativist mob [[Ursuline Convent Riots|attacked and burned down]] a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured). In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities. In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force. In [[Louisville, Kentucky]], election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as \"[[Bloody Monday]].\"<ref>Smith, Peter. \"Recalling Bloody Monday; Events to mark 1855 anti-immigrant riots in city,\" The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Ky.

In other words, the races most affected by the illiteracy test are those whose emigration to this country has begun within the last twenty years and swelled rapidly to enormous proportions, races with which the English speaking people have never hitherto assimilated, and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lodge|first=Henry Cabot|title=The Restriction Immigration|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|accessdate=3 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306093754/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nResponding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the [[Dillingham Commission]], was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/>\n\nFollowing World War I, nativists in the twenties focused their attention on southern and eastern Europeans due to their Catholic and Jewish faith, and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism.<ref name=\"Higham 1963 324\">{{cite book|last=Higham|first=John|title=Strangers in the Land|year=1963|publisher=Atheneum|page=324}}</ref> The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, ''The Passing of the Great Race'' nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the ghettos. ''The Passing of the Great Race'' reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/>\nIn the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The second [[Ku Klux Klan]], which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist, anti-Catholic, and anti-semitic rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack, such as in [[Chicago]] in 1921 where ethnic Irish residents hanged a Klan member in front of 3,000 people.<ref>Todd Tucker, ''Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan'' (2004)</ref>\n\nAfter intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921. This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/> However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.\n\nThe Emergency Quota Act was followed with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], a more permanent resolution. This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/> Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States, especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries.<ref name=\"Higham 1963 324\"/>\n\nFear of low-skilled Southern and Eastern European immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s, and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America).\n\nAn [[immigration reduction]]ism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels.\n\nAmerican nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at [[illegal immigration|undocumented workers]], largely [[Mexico|Mexican]] resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996.\n\nMost immigration reductionists see [[Illegal immigration]], principally from across the [[United States\u2013Mexico border]], as the more pressing concern. Authors such as [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions.<ref>Huntington, ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' (1997)</ref>\n\nNoting the large-scale Mexican immigration in the Southwest, the Cold-war diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] in 2002 saw \"unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand\", and those of \"some northern regions\". In the former, he warned:\n:the very culture of the bulk of the population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin-American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions&nbsp;... Could it really be that there was so little of merit [in America] that it deserves to be recklessly trashed in favor of a polyglot mix-mash?\"<ref>[[Bill Kauffman]], [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ Free Vermont], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' December 19, 2005.</ref>\n\nMayers argues that Kennan represented the \"tradition of militant nativism\" that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s.<ref>David Mayers, ''George Kennan and the Dilemmas of US Foreign Policy'' (1990) ch 3</ref> Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power.\n\n====21st century====\nBy late 2014, the \"[[Tea Party movement]]\" had turned its focus away from economic issues, spending, and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]], and towards President [[Barack Obama]]'s immigration policies, which it saw as a threat to transform American society. It planned to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator [[John McCain]].  A typical slogan appeared in the ''Tea Party Tribune'': \u201cAmnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.\u201d The ''New York Times'' reported:\n:What started five years ago as a groundswell of conservatives committed to curtailing the reach of the federal government, cutting the deficit and countering the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party has become a movement largely against immigration overhaul.

[[John Cassidy (journalist)|Journalist John Cassidy]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' Trump is transforming the GOP into a populist, nativist party:\n:Trump has been drawing on a base of alienated white working-class and middle-class voters, seeking to remake the G.O.P. into a more populist, nativist, avowedly protectionist, and semi-isolationist party that is skeptical of immigration, free trade, and military interventionism.<ref>John Cassidy , \"Donald Trump Is Transforming the G.O.P. into a Populist, Nativist Party.

The country encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration always faced considerable backlash.

In fact, there were violent revolts in the Japanese community of the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] when [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] declared that Japan surrendered and he was not a deity, which was thought as a conspiracy trying to hurt Japanese honor and strength. Nevertheless, it followed hostility from the government. The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without [[safe conduct]] issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco Am\u00e9rica do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations because of \"activities against national security\" arising from disagreements between neighbours, recovery of debts and even fights between children.<ref name=\"suzuki\"/> Japanese Brazilians were arrested for \"suspicious activity\" when they were in artistic meetings or [[picnic]]s. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in [[Santos (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Santos]] had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in [[Baixada Santista]], the Japanese had to have a safe conduct.<ref name=\"suzuki\"/> In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in [[Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u]], in [[Par\u00e1]], was virtually turned into a \"concentration camp\" (expression of the time) from which no Japanese could leave. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to \"internment camps\" without the need for legal support, in the same manner [[Japanese American internment|as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States]].

Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism.\n\nOnce Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of [[Trade union|unionism]] and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as [[strikebreaker]]s, integration was open for most Italian immigrants.

In this context \"Native\" does not mean [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture. Nativists objected primarily to [[Irish Catholic|Irish Roman Catholics]] because of their loyalty to the [[Pope]] and also because of their supposed rejection of [[republicanism]] as an American ideal.<ref>Ray A.

In 1836, [[Samuel Morse]] ran unsuccessfully for [[Mayor of New York City]] on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes.

It was at this time that the term \"nativist\" first appears, opponents denounced them as \"bigoted nativists.\" Former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]] ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856. The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called \"nativists.\"<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s''</ref>\n\nThis form of [[nationalism]] is often identified with [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment (anti-Papism). In [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], a nativist mob [[Ursuline Convent Riots|attacked and burned down]] a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured). In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities. In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force. In [[Louisville, Kentucky]], election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as \"[[Bloody Monday]].\"<ref>Smith, Peter. \"Recalling Bloody Monday; Events to mark 1855 anti-immigrant riots in city,\" The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Ky.

In other words, the races most affected by the illiteracy test are those whose emigration to this country has begun within the last twenty years and swelled rapidly to enormous proportions, races with which the English speaking people have never hitherto assimilated, and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lodge|first=Henry Cabot|title=The Restriction Immigration|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|accessdate=3 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306093754/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nResponding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the [[Dillingham Commission]], was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/>\n\nFollowing World War I, nativists in the twenties focused their attention on southern and eastern Europeans due to their Catholic and Jewish faith, and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism.<ref name=\"Higham 1963 324\">{{cite book|last=Higham|first=John|title=Strangers in the Land|year=1963|publisher=Atheneum|page=324}}</ref> The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, ''The Passing of the Great Race'' nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the ghettos. ''The Passing of the Great Race'' reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/>\nIn the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The second [[Ku Klux Klan]], which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist, anti-Catholic, and anti-semitic rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack, such as in [[Chicago]] in 1921 where ethnic Irish residents hanged a Klan member in front of 3,000 people.<ref>Todd Tucker, ''Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan'' (2004)</ref>\n\nAfter intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921. This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/> However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.\n\nThe Emergency Quota Act was followed with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], a more permanent resolution. This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687.<ref name=\"Pula 1980 5\u201331\"/> Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States, especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries.<ref name=\"Higham 1963 324\"/>\n\nFear of low-skilled Southern and Eastern European immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s, and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America).\n\nAn [[immigration reduction]]ism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels.\n\nAmerican nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at [[illegal immigration|undocumented workers]], largely [[Mexico|Mexican]] resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996.\n\nMost immigration reductionists see [[Illegal immigration]], principally from across the [[United States\u2013Mexico border]], as the more pressing concern. Authors such as [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions.<ref>Huntington, ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' (1997)</ref>\n\nNoting the large-scale Mexican immigration in the Southwest, the Cold-war diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] in 2002 saw \"unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand\", and those of \"some northern regions\". In the former, he warned:\n:the very culture of the bulk of the population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin-American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions&nbsp;... Could it really be that there was so little of merit [in America] that it deserves to be recklessly trashed in favor of a polyglot mix-mash?\"<ref>[[Bill Kauffman]], [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ Free Vermont], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' December 19, 2005.</ref>\n\nMayers argues that Kennan represented the \"tradition of militant nativism\" that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s.<ref>David Mayers, ''George Kennan and the Dilemmas of US Foreign Policy'' (1990) ch 3</ref> Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power.\n\n====21st century====\nBy late 2014, the \"[[Tea Party movement]]\" had turned its focus away from economic issues, spending, and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]], and towards President [[Barack Obama]]'s immigration policies, which it saw as a threat to transform American society. It planned to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator [[John McCain]].  A typical slogan appeared in the ''Tea Party Tribune'': \u201cAmnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.\u201d The ''New York Times'' reported:\n:What started five years ago as a groundswell of conservatives committed to curtailing the reach of the federal government, cutting the deficit and countering the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party has become a movement largely against immigration overhaul. The politicians, intellectual leaders and activists who consider themselves part of the Tea Party have redirected their energy from fiscal austerity and small government to stopping any changes that would legitimize people who are here illegally, either through granting them citizenship or legal status.<ref>Jeremy W. Peters, \"Obama\u2019s Immigration Action Reinvigorates Tea Party,\" [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/obamas-immigration-action-reinvigorates-tea-party.html ''New York Times'' Nov 25, 2014]</ref>\n\nIn his 2016 bid for presidency, Republican Presidential Candidate [[Donald Trump]] has been accused of introducing nativist themes for his controversial stances on temporarily banning foreign Muslims from six specific countries entering the United States and erecting a [[Trump's border wall|substantial wall]] between the [[US-Mexico border]] to halt [[illegal immigration]]. [[John Cassidy (journalist)|Journalist John Cassidy]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' Trump is transforming the GOP into a populist, nativist party:\n:Trump has been drawing on a base of alienated white working-class and middle-class voters, seeking to remake the G.O.P. into a more populist, nativist, avowedly protectionist, and semi-isolationist party that is skeptical of immigration, free trade, and military interventionism.<ref>John Cassidy , \"Donald Trump Is Transforming the G.O.P. into a Populist, Nativist Party.

The way that film illustrated  [[Na Ok-Bun]]\u2019s enterprising attitude of her life and her courageously testifying in front of the whole world were applauded. The film stars [[Na Moon-hee]] as Na Ok-Bun, with [[Lee Je-hoon]] as Park Min-Jae. The scene of [[Na Ok-Bun]]\u2019s testimony of the United States Congress was filmed at the actual congress of Richmond, Virginia, USA. \u00a0\n\n==Plot==\nNah Ok-Bun is an elderly woman who is notorious for filing citizen's complaint at her district office and nicknamed \"Goblin Granny\". When Ok-Bun meets Park Min Jae, a young man who has recently been appointed as a junior civil service officer, she is dissatisfied with his attitude of not caring about her complaints and only trying to do the jobs that are assigned to him. \n\nBut there is an opportunity between these two as Ok-Bun wants to learn English. The senior class run by the local resident center does not fit her level, and the class at the English academy is too fast-paced and so she is eventually kicked out of the class. Ok-Bun sees Min Jae speaking English very fluently with a native speaker in the academy. Forgetting all the troubles she had with Min Jae, Ok-Bun asks Min Jae to teach her English. Min Jae refuses Ok-Bun's request because he does not want to take on the troublesome role. When Min Jae sees Ok-Bun taking care of his younger brother, Young Jae, he is moved by her warmth and agrees to become her English teacher. Min Jae teaches Ok-Bun and Ok-Bun's English improves.\n\nMin Jae learns that Ok-Bun wishes to learn English to continue her friend Jeong-Shim's dream of testifying in front of the [[comfort women]] public hearing in Washington D.C. Ok-Bun and Jeong-Shim were both victims of the Japanese Military during [[World War II]].

[[Kim Hyun-seok (filmmaker)|Kim Hyun-seok]] and distributed by Lotte Entertainment <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/bluehouse/817968.html|title=\u2018\uc544\uc774 \uce94

The genre of the film is both comedy and drama. The film depicts the story of the resolution of conviction for \u201ccomfort women\u201d (HR121) of the Japanese military in 2007.  Though the film is a comedy <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%20%EC%BA%94%20%EC%8A%A4%ED%94%BC%ED%81%AC/%EC%A4%84%EA%B1%B0%EB%A6%AC|title=\uc544\uc774 \uce94 \uc2a4\ud53c\ud06c/\uc904\uac70\ub9ac - \ub098\ubb34\uc704\ud0a4|website=namu.wiki|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>, the genre serves as a vehicle to discuss the deeper topic of Korean  [[comfort women]]. The way that film illustrated  [[Na Ok-Bun]]\u2019s enterprising attitude of her life and her courageously testifying in front of the whole world were applauded. The film stars [[Na Moon-hee]] as Na Ok-Bun, with [[Lee Je-hoon]] as Park Min-Jae. The scene of [[Na Ok-Bun]]\u2019s testimony of the United States Congress was filmed at the actual congress of Richmond, Virginia, USA. \u00a0\n\n==Plot==\nNah Ok-Bun is an elderly woman who is notorious for filing citizen's complaint at her district office and nicknamed \"Goblin Granny\". When Ok-Bun meets Park Min Jae, a young man who has recently been appointed as a junior civil service officer, she is dissatisfied with his attitude of not caring about her complaints and only trying to do the jobs that are assigned to him. \n\nBut there is an opportunity between these two as Ok-Bun wants to learn English. The senior class run by the local resident center does not fit her level, and the class at the English academy is too fast-paced and so she is eventually kicked out of the class. Ok-Bun sees Min Jae speaking English very fluently with a native speaker in the academy. Forgetting all the troubles she had with Min Jae, Ok-Bun asks Min Jae to teach her English. Min Jae refuses Ok-Bun's request because he does not want to take on the troublesome role. When Min Jae sees Ok-Bun taking care of his younger brother, Young Jae, he is moved by her warmth and agrees to become her English teacher. Min Jae teaches Ok-Bun and Ok-Bun\u2019s English improves.\n\nMin Jae learns that Ok-Bun wishes to learn English to continue her friend Jeong-Shim's dream of testifying in front of the [[comfort women]] public hearing in Washington D.C. Ok-Bun and Jeong-Shim were both victims of the Japanese Military during [[World War II]]. Although Ok-Bun has prepared what to say in the public hearing, she can hardly speak as she is overwhelmed by the pressure she feels in the unfamiliar surroundings.
