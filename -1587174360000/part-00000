The genus, which lived worldwide throughout most of the [[Late Cretaceous]], was named by [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]] in 1799.<ref>Lamarck, J. P. B.

The aperture likewise slopes to the front and has a sinuous margin. The venter is narrowly rounded to acute while the dorsum is more broad. The juvenile shell, found at the apex, is coiled in one or two whorls and described as minute, about a centimeter in diameter. Adult ''Baculites'' ranged in size from about seven centimeters (''Baculites larsoni'') up to two meters in length.\n\nAs with other [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]], the shell consisted of a series of camerae, or chambers, that were connected to the animal by a narrow tube called a siphuncle by which gas content and thereby buoyancy could be regulated in the same manner as ''[[Nautilus]]'' does today.  The chambers are separated by walls called septa. The line where each septum meets the outer shell is called the suture or suture line. Like other true [[Ammonitida|ammonites]], ''Baculites'' have intricate suture patterns on their shells that can be used to identify different species.\n\nOne notable feature about ''Baculites'' is that the males may have been a third to a half the size of the females and may have had much lighter ribbing on the surface of the shell.\n\nThe shell morphology of ''Baculites'' with slanted striations or ribbing, similarly slanted aperture, and more narrowly rounded to acute keel-like venter points to its having had a horizontal orientation in life as an adult. This same type of cross section is found in much earlier [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]] such as ''[[Bassleroceras]]'' and ''[[Clitendoceras]]'' from the [[Ordovician]] period, which can be shown to have had a horizontal orientation. In spite of this, some researchers have concluded that Baculites lived in a vertical orientation, head hanging straight down, since lacking an apical counterweight, movement was largely restricted to that direction.  More recent research, notably by Gerd Westermann, has reaffirmed that at least some ''Baculites'' species in fact lived in a more or less horizontal orientation.<ref>Westermann, G. E. G. 1996. Ammonoid life and habitat. In N. H. Landman, K. Tanabe, and R. A. Davis (editors), ''Ammonoid Paleobiology'', pp. 607\u2013707. New York: Plenum Press.</ref>\n\nFrom shell isotope studies, it is thought that ''Baculites'' inhabited the middle part of the water column, not too close to either the bottom or surface of the ocean. In some rock deposits ''Baculites'' are common, and they are thought to have lived in great shoals.  However, they are not known to occur so densely as to be rock-forming, as do certain other extinct, straight-shelled cephalopods (e.g., [[orthoceras|orthocerid nautiloids]]).\n\n''Baculites'' fossils are very brittle and almost always break.  They are most commonly found broken in half or several pieces, usually along suture lines.  Individual chambers found this way are sometimes referred to as \"stone buffaloes\" (due to their shapes), though the Native-American attribution typically given as part of the story behind the name is likely apocryphal.{{Clarify|date=August 2018}} The Blackfoot have oral traditions that tell a story of the Iniskimm (Buffalo Calling Stone). They are still in use today by Indigenous peoples. \n\n''Baculites'' and related [[Cretaceous]] straight [[ammonite]] cephalopods are often confused with the superficially similar [[orthocerid]] [[nautiloid]] cephalopods.  Both are long and tubular in form, and both are common items for sale in rock shops (often under each other's names).  Both lineages evidently evolved the tubular form independently, and at different times in earth history.  The [[orthocerid]] [[nautiloid]]s lived much earlier (common during the [[Paleozoic]] Era and extinct by the end of the [[Triassic]] Period) than ''Baculites'' (Late [[Cretaceous]] Period only).  The two types of fossils can be distinguished by many features, most obvious among which is the suture line: it is simple in orthocerid nautiloids and intricately folded in ''Baculites'' and related ammonoids.\n\nStudies<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kruta | first1 = I. | last2 = Landman | first2 = N. | last3 = Rouget | first3 = I. | last4 = Cecca | first4 = F. | last5 = Tafforeau | first5 = P. | title = The Role of Ammonites in the Mesozoic Marine Food Web Revealed by Jaw Preservation | doi = 10.1126/science.1198793 | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6013 | pages = 70\u201372| year = 2011 | pmid =  21212354| pmc = |bibcode = 2011Sci...331...70K }}</ref> on exceptionally preserved specimens have revealed a [[radula]] by [[synchrotron]] imagery.

However, it is far more questionable whether an automatic and inevitable link exists between Hamas and Islamic social and economic institutions, whether those links are inherently subversive, or whether such institutions promote radicalism and violence as is commonly assumed.\" Roy also writes: \"logic maintains, institutional clients become automatically linked to Hamas and constitute a base of support for political Islam.

Originally scheduled as the Grand Prix of Portugal at the [[Aut\u00f3dromo do Estoril|Estoril]] circuit, it was moved when Estoril's management had financial difficulties. It was the 17th and final race of the [[1997 FIA Formula One World Championship]]. The 69-lap race was won by [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] in a [[McLaren]], his first Formula One race victory. His teammate [[David Coulthard]] finished second and [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] driver [[Jacques Villeneuve]] took third, which was sufficient for him to win the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship]]. {{As of|2020}}, these are Williams's last Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships. This was also the final Grand Prix for [[Ukyo Katayama]], [[Norberto Fontana]] and 10-time Grand Prix winner [[Gerhard Berger]].\n\n[[Michael Schumacher]], driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], had led the championship by a single point ahead of Villeneuve going into the race. During the race Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher's car forced him to retire. The blame for the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport's governing body, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], and he was stripped of his second-place finish in the championship. Schumacher's tactics were widely criticised by the media, including publications based in his home country of Germany, and in Ferrari's home country of Italy.\n\nFollowing the race Williams and McLaren were accused of colluding to decide the finishing order. Villeneuve stated that \"it was better to let them through and win the World Championship\". The FIA determined there was no evidence to support the claims, and dismissed the accusations.\n\n== Report ==\n\n===Background===\nOriginally scheduled as the Grand Prix of Portugal at the Estoril Circuit, the race was moved to the Jerez Circuit when Estoril's management had financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portugal is off!|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns01187.html|work=Grandprix.com|publisher=Inside F1|date=28 July 1997|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> The race was added to the schedule after Japan because engine suppliers [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] did not want their last Formula One race to be in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula One - The road to Jerez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/12546.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] ([[BBC]])|date=25 October 1997|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref>\n \nHeading into the final race of the season, two drivers were still in contention for the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]].

Schumacher would be world champion if he finished ahead of Villeneuve, or if Villeneuve failed to score any points by finishing lower than sixth or not completing the race.\n\nIn the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]], Williams led with 118 points and Ferrari were second on 100. Williams had therefore clinched the constructors' title before the race, as even if Ferrari finished first and second in the race, thereby taking 16 points, and both Williams cars failed to score a point, they could not beat Williams.<ref name=points/>\n\nFollowing the Japanese Grand Prix on 12 October, the teams conducted testing sessions at various locations around the world.

Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to set the time given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, [[Damon Hill]], in his [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]], with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three.

Under the orders of the Williams team, on lap eight Frentzen let teammate Villeneuve past. Schumacher made his first pit-stop on lap 22 and Villeneuve made his first stop the following lap. Both retained their positions. During the first round of pitstops the McLarens swapped places with [[David Coulthard]] leading [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and Frentzen dropped to fifth position behind both of them. The order of the leaders after the second round of pit stops on lap 43 and lap 44 remained the same but with Villeneuve closer to Schumacher.\n\nVilleneuve went into lap 48 less than a second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he attempted to overtake Schumacher at the ''Dry Sack'' corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision.

When questioned on the subject Max Mosley said that the World Council had decided not to invoke Article 123.

''[[Bild]]'' said \"Schumacher was to blame for the crash\". \"He played for high stakes and lost everything \u2013 the World Championship and his reputation for fair play. There is no doubt that he wanted to take out Villeneuve.\" The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' called him \"a kamikaze without honour\" and commented that the \"monument is starting to crack because the foundations are faulty\".

The daily newspaper ''l'Unit\u00e0'' called for him to be fired by Ferrari. \"Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed\" it reported. \"The driver covered himself, Ferrari and Italian sport as a whole with shame. We are waiting for Ferrari to announce that it is throwing out Michael Schumacher and hiring a new driver who is more intelligent, has more wisdom and a real sense of morality.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" />\n\n''[[La Repubblica]]'' reported that \"seeing a world title vanish after waiting 18 years is sad enough. But to see it go up in smoke with the move from Michael Schumacher is unfortunately much worse. It's shameful.\" ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' said that if Ferrari had won the title it would have been \"''a title to hide''\" and said that it preferred to go on waiting for the day when \"our passion for Ferrari has a happy ending.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" /> Even ''[[La Stampa]]'', the newspaper owned by the [[Agnelli family]], which also controls Ferrari, said \"His image as a champion was shattered, like a glass hit by a stone.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" />\n\nIn the British newspapers, Schumacher's manoeuvre against [[Damon Hill]] at the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]] was used as a comparison in many of the reports. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Schumacher had now \"lost the last vestige of his reputation of being a sportsman\" and ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that Schumacher had \"sacrificed his reputation by an act of such cynicism that it lost him the right to any sympathy\".<ref name=\"Newspaper\" />\n\nFerrari hosted a press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher admitted that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgement rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve. \"I am human like everyone else and unfortunately I made a mistake,\" he said. \"I don't make many but I did this time.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" /> In their respective books on Schumacher, James Allen and Swiss motorsports author Luc Domenjoz have both since expressed the view that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast, and without Schumacher turning into him would have overshot the turn.<ref>Allen (2000) p.26, Domenjoz, Luc ''Michael Schumacher : Rise of a Genius''</ref>\n\n===Jerez circuit===\nOn 12 December 1997, the World Motorsport Council ruled that the mayor of [[Jerez]], Pedro Pacheco, disrupted the podium ceremony.

However, when Mr Pacheco appeared before the WMSC, this ruling was rescinded.<ref>[[Autosport]] magazine, 26 July 2007, page 8</ref>\n\nThe people chosen to present the trophies were dependent on the race order, with Daimler-Benz chairman [[J\u00fcrgen Schrempp]] only willing to make a presentation to a McLaren-Mercedes driver. As the McLarens of H\u00e4kkinen and Coulthard passed Villeneuve's Williams on the last lap, this would have meant he could present either the trophy for first or second position or the winning constructor trophy. There was some confusion due to the late changes in position and whilst the Mayor and the president of the region presented trophies, Schrempp did nothing.

Originally scheduled as the Grand Prix of Portugal at the [[Aut\u00f3dromo do Estoril|Estoril]] circuit, it was moved when Estoril's management had financial difficulties. It was the 17th and final race of the [[1997 FIA Formula One World Championship]]. The 69-lap race was won by [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] in a [[McLaren]], his first Formula One race victory. His teammate [[David Coulthard]] finished second and [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] driver [[Jacques Villeneuve]] took third, which was sufficient for him to win the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship]]. {{As of|2020}}, these are Williams's last Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships. This was also the final Grand Prix for [[Ukyo Katayama]], [[Norberto Fontana]] and 10-time Grand Prix winner [[Gerhard Berger]].\n\n[[Michael Schumacher]], driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], had led the championship by a single point ahead of Villeneuve going into the race. During the race Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher's car forced him to retire. The blame for the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport's governing body, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], and he was stripped of his second-place finish in the championship. Schumacher's tactics were widely criticised by the media, including publications based in his home country of Germany, and in Ferrari's home country of Italy.\n\nFollowing the race Williams and McLaren were accused of colluding to decide the finishing order. Villeneuve stated that \"it was better to let them through and win the World Championship\". The FIA determined there was no evidence to support the claims, and dismissed the accusations.\n\n== Report ==\n\n===Background===\nOriginally scheduled as the Grand Prix of Portugal at the Estoril Circuit, the race was moved to the Jerez Circuit when Estoril's management had financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portugal is off!|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns01187.html|work=Grandprix.com|publisher=Inside F1|date=28 July 1997|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> The race was added to the schedule after Japan because engine suppliers [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] did not want their last Formula One race to be in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula One - The road to Jerez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/12546.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] ([[BBC]])|date=25 October 1997|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref>\n \nHeading into the final race of the season, two drivers were still in contention for the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]]. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver Michael Schumacher was leading with 78 points; [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] driver Jacques Villeneuve was second with 77 points, one point behind Schumacher.

Schumacher would be world champion if he finished ahead of Villeneuve, or if Villeneuve failed to score any points by finishing lower than sixth or not completing the race.\n\nIn the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]], Williams led with 118 points and Ferrari were second on 100. Williams had therefore clinched the constructors' title before the race, as even if Ferrari finished first and second in the race, thereby taking 16 points, and both Williams cars failed to score a point, they could not beat Williams.<ref name=points/>\n\nFollowing the Japanese Grand Prix on 12 October, the teams conducted testing sessions at various locations around the world. Williams, Benetton, [[Sauber]], [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] and McLaren conducted at a test session at the [[Silverstone Circuit]]. Williams, Sauber and Jordan tested using 1998-spec cars, in preparation for the {{F1|1998}} season. [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] conducted testing at the [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours]] circuit, performing wet weather tyre development with tyre suppliers [[Bridgestone]] with the circuit flooded to simulate wet weather conditions. [[Prost Grand Prix|Prost]] conducted testing at [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya|Circuit de Catalunya]] and performed tyre testing for Bridgestone, as well as testing their 1998-specification car.

A further fourteen minutes later, [[Michael Schumacher]] posted an identical time. With nine minutes of the session remaining, [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] crossed the line, again with a time of 1:21.072. Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to set the time given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, [[Damon Hill]], in his [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]], with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three. Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow towards the end of the lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving [[Ukyo Katayama]]'s [[Minardi]].\n\n===Race===\nThe race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 [[Central European Time|CET]] ([[UTC]]+1), in dry and sunny weather. Villeneuve started the race in pole position, with Schumacher in second. Just a few moments before the start of the race, a blue liquid came out of Villeneuve's Williams. However, this did not influence his car during the race. Schumacher's getaway at the start was better than Villeneuve's and he had taken the lead by the time they reached the first corner.

Under the orders of the Williams team, on lap eight Frentzen let teammate Villeneuve past. Schumacher made his first pit-stop on lap 22 and Villeneuve made his first stop the following lap. Both retained their positions. During the first round of pitstops the McLarens swapped places with [[David Coulthard]] leading [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and Frentzen dropped to fifth position behind both of them. The order of the leaders after the second round of pit stops on lap 43 and lap 44 remained the same but with Villeneuve closer to Schumacher.\n\nVilleneuve went into lap 48 less than a second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he attempted to overtake Schumacher at the ''Dry Sack'' corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter [[James Allen (Formula One commentator)|James Allen]] has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve.<ref>Allen, James (2000) ''Michael Schumacher : Driven to Extremes'' p.26 Bantam Books This is also noted in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Formula One'' p.195</ref> [[Martin Brundle]], in the commentary box alongside [[Murray Walker]], immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, \"That didn't work Michael.

The slower pace of Villeneuve's car meant that on the last lap, he had been caught by both McLarens, H\u00e4kkinen having regained second place from Coulthard under [[team orders]]. After the race Villeneuve stated \"I did not fight then. It was better to let them through and win the World Championship. It is a good exchange.\"<ref name=\"grandprix\" /> [[Gerhard Berger]] in fourth place (in what turned out to be his final Grand Prix) was also catching Villeneuve but he did not pass before crossing the finish line. The final margin between Villeneuve and Berger was 0.116 seconds. Third place meant Villeneuve finished ahead of Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship by three points, and became World Champion.

This meant he lost his second place in the overall standings to [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] but he would retain his race victories and other results and would not be fined or face any further punishment in the following season.

When questioned on the subject Max Mosley said that the World Council had decided not to invoke Article 123. Another question which the World Council failed to address was whether or not there would be any public sanction against the stewards at Jerez, who had dismissed the Schumacher-Villeneuve incident, which, has been claimed, was a dereliction of their duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns01356.html|title=The FIA ignores its own rules|accessdate=29 October 2006|date=17 November 1997|work=Grandprix.com|publisher=Inside F1}}</ref>\n\n===Media reaction===\nThe German newspapers were among the many from across Europe that attacked Schumacher. ''[[Bild]]'' said \"Schumacher was to blame for the crash\". \"He played for high stakes and lost everything \u2013 the World Championship and his reputation for fair play. There is no doubt that he wanted to take out Villeneuve.\" The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' called him \"a kamikaze without honour\" and commented that the \"monument is starting to crack because the foundations are faulty\". A German TV station asked fans for their views and received the views of 63,081 votes. 28% said they could not support Schumacher any longer.<ref name=\"Newspaper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns01331.html|title=The lost honor of Michael Schumacher|accessdate=29 October 2006|date= | publisher = www.grandprix.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy there was widespread condemnation of Schumacher. The daily newspaper ''l'Unit\u00e0'' called for him to be fired by Ferrari. \"Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed\" it reported. \"The driver covered himself, Ferrari and Italian sport as a whole with shame. We are waiting for Ferrari to announce that it is throwing out Michael Schumacher and hiring a new driver who is more intelligent, has more wisdom and a real sense of morality.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" />\n\n''[[La Repubblica]]'' reported that \"seeing a world title vanish after waiting 18 years is sad enough. But to see it go up in smoke with the move from Michael Schumacher is unfortunately much worse. It's shameful.\" ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' said that if Ferrari had won the title it would have been \"''a title to hide''\" and said that it preferred to go on waiting for the day when \"our passion for Ferrari has a happy ending.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" /> Even ''[[La Stampa]]'', the newspaper owned by the [[Agnelli family]], which also controls Ferrari, said \"His image as a champion was shattered, like a glass hit by a stone.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" />\n\nIn the British newspapers, Schumacher's manoeuvre against [[Damon Hill]] at the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix]] was used as a comparison in many of the reports. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Schumacher had now \"lost the last vestige of his reputation of being a sportsman\" and ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that Schumacher had \"sacrificed his reputation by an act of such cynicism that it lost him the right to any sympathy\".<ref name=\"Newspaper\" />\n\nFerrari hosted a press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher admitted that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgement rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve. \"I am human like everyone else and unfortunately I made a mistake,\" he said. \"I don't make many but I did this time.\"<ref name=\"Newspaper\" /> In their respective books on Schumacher, James Allen and Swiss motorsports author Luc Domenjoz have both since expressed the view that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast, and without Schumacher turning into him would have overshot the turn.<ref>Allen (2000) p.26, Domenjoz, Luc ''Michael Schumacher : Rise of a Genius''</ref>\n\n===Jerez circuit===\nOn 12 December 1997, the World Motorsport Council ruled that the mayor of [[Jerez]], Pedro Pacheco, disrupted the podium ceremony. Originally, the verdict was that no further Formula One races would occur at the track. However, when Mr Pacheco appeared before the WMSC, this ruling was rescinded.<ref>[[Autosport]] magazine, 26 July 2007, page 8</ref>\n\nThe people chosen to present the trophies were dependent on the race order, with Daimler-Benz chairman [[J\u00fcrgen Schrempp]] only willing to make a presentation to a McLaren-Mercedes driver. As the McLarens of H\u00e4kkinen and Coulthard passed Villeneuve's Williams on the last lap, this would have meant he could present either the trophy for first or second position or the winning constructor trophy. There was some confusion due to the late changes in position and whilst the Mayor and the president of the region presented trophies, Schrempp did nothing. FIA president Max Mosley later announced \"The disruption caused embarrassment and inconvenience to those presenting the trophies and therefore, no further rounds of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship will be held at the Jerez circuit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns01392.html|title=Goodbye Jerez!|accessdate=29 October 2006|date= | publisher = www.grandprix.com}}</ref> {{As of| 2020}}, this race was the last time that [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez]] hosted a Formula One Grand Prix, although it has held many pre-season test days.\n\n===Collusion allegations===\n{{Quote box\n|width=250px\n|align=right\n|quote='''[[Murray Walker]]''': A case of champagne from Ferrari to Sauber for Norberto Fontana.
