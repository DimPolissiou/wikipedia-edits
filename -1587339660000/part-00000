Inspired by studies of [[Denmark|Danish]] dunes by [[Eugen Warming]], Cowles studied [[vegetation]] development on sand dunes on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] (the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|Indiana Dunes]]). He recognized that vegetation on dunes of different ages might be interpreted as different stages of a general trend of vegetation development on dunes (an approach to the study of vegetation change later termed space-for-time substitution, or [[chronosequence]] studies). He first published this work as a paper in the ''Botanical Gazette'' in 1899 (\"The ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes of Lake Michigan\").<ref name=Cowles>{{cite journal |date=1899 |author=E.C.

Clements explicitly analogized the successional development of ecological communities with ontogenetic development of individual organisms, and his model is often referred to as the pseudo-organismic theory of community ecology. Clements and his followers developed a complex taxonomy of communities and successional pathways.\n\n[[Henry Gleason]] offered a contrasting framework as early as the 1920s. The Gleasonian model was more complex and much less deterministic than the Clementsian. It differs most fundamentally from the Clementsian view in suggesting a much greater role of [[Stochastic process|chance factors]] and in denying the existence of coherent, sharply bounded community types. Gleason argued that species distributions responded individualistically to environmental factors, and communities were best regarded as artifacts of the juxtaposition of species distributions. Gleason's ideas, first published in 1926, were largely ignored until the late 1950s.\n\nTwo quotes illustrate the contrasting views of Clements and Gleason. Clements wrote in 1916:\n\n{{quote|The developmental study of vegetation necessarily rests upon the assumption that the unit or climax formation is an organic entity. As an organism the formation arises, grows, matures, and dies. Furthermore, each climax formation is able to reproduce itself, repeating with essential fidelity the stages of its development.|Frederic Clements<ref name=Clements>Clements, Frederic E. (1916) ''Plant succession: an analysis of the development of vegetation''</ref>}}\nwhile Gleason, in his 1926 paper, said:\n{{quote|An association is not an organism, scarcely even a vegetational unit, but merely a coincidence.|Henry Gleason<ref>Gleason, Henry A.(1926) The individualistic concept of the plant association. The Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club</ref>}}\n\nGleason's ideas were, in fact, more consistent with Cowles' original thinking about succession. About Clements' distinction between [[primary succession]] and [[secondary succession]], [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Cowles]] wrote (1911):\n\n{{quote|This classification seems not to be of fundamental value, since it separates such closely related phenomena as those of erosion and deposition, and it places together such unlike things as human agencies and the subsidence of land.|Henry Cowles<ref>[[Henry C. Cowles|Cowles, Henry C.]] (1911) The causes of vegetational cycles. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 1 (1): 3-20 [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2560843]</ref>}}\n\n===Modern era===\nA more rigorous, data-driven testing of successional models and community theory generally began with the work of [[Robert Whittaker (ecologist)|Robert Whittaker]] and [[John Curtis (biologist)|John Curtis]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Succession theory has since become less monolithic and more complex. [[Connell\u2013Slatyer model of ecological succession|J. Connell and R. Slatyer]] attempted a codification of successional processes by mechanism. Among British and North American ecologists, the notion of a stable [[climax vegetation]] has been largely abandoned, and successional processes have come to be seen as much less deterministic, with important roles for historical [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] and for alternate pathways in the actual development of communities. Debates continue as to the general predictability of successional dynamics and the relative importance of equilibrial vs. non-equilibrial processes. Former Harvard professor F. A. Bazzaz introduced the notion of ''scale'' into the discussion, as he considered that at local or small area scale the processes are stochastic and patchy, but taking bigger regional areas into consideration, certain tendencies can not be denied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9-780521-398435|pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Factors==\n\nThe trajectory of successional change can be influenced by site conditions, by the character of the events initiating succession (perturbations), by the interactions of the species present, and by more [[stochastic]] factors such as availability of colonists or seeds or [[weather]] conditions at the time of disturbance. Some of these factors contribute to predictability of succession dynamics; others add more [[probability|probabilistic]] elements. Two important perturbation factors today are [[Human impact on the environment|human actions]] and [[Global warming|climatic change]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9-780521-398435|page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn general, communities in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-[[biological dispersal|dispersed]] species ([[opportunist]], [[fugitive]], or [[r-selected]] life-histories). As succession proceeds, these species will tend to be replaced by more competitive ([[k-selected]]) species.\n\nTrends in [[ecosystem]] and community properties in succession have been suggested, but few appear to be general. For example, [[species diversity]] almost necessarily increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in later succession as competition eliminates opportunistic species and leads to [[Competitive exclusion principle|dominance by locally superior competitors]]. [[Primary production|Net Primary Productivity]], [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] properties all show variable patterns over succession, depending on the particular system and site.\n\nEcological succession was formerly seen as having a stable end-stage called the [[Climax community|climax]], sometimes referred to as the 'potential vegetation' of a site, and shaped primarily by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of ecosystems dynamics. Most natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a \"climax\" community unattainable. [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]] often occurs at a rate and frequency sufficient to prevent arrival at a climax state. Additions to available species pools through range expansions and [[Introduced species|introductions]] can also continually reshape communities.\n\nThe development of some ecosystem attributes, such as [[pedogenesis|soil properties]] and [[nutrient cycles]], are both influenced by community properties, and, in turn, influence further successional development. This feed-back process may occur only over centuries or millennia. Coupled with the [[stochastic]] nature of disturbance events and other long-term (e.g., climatic) changes, such dynamics make it doubtful whether the 'climax' concept ever applies or is particularly useful in considering actual vegetation.\n\n==Types==\n{{main|Primary succession|Secondary succession|Cyclic succession}}\n\n===Primary succession===\nSuccessional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area that has not been previously occupied by an ecological community, such as newly exposed rock or sand surfaces, lava flows, newly exposed glacial tills, etc., are referred to as primary succession.

Dynamics in secondary succession are strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions, including soil development, seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms. Because of residual fertility and pre-existing organisms, community change in early stages of secondary succession can be relatively rapid.\n\nSecondary succession is much more commonly observed and studied than primary succession. Particularly common types of secondary succession include responses to natural disturbances such as fire, flood, and severe winds, and to human-caused disturbances such as logging and agriculture. In secondary succession, the soils and organisms need to be left unharmed so there is a way for the new material to rebuild.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs an example, in a fragmented old field habitat created in eastern Kansas, woody plants \"colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Cook, W.M. |author2=Yao, J.|author3= Foster, B.L.|author4=Holt, R.D. |author5=Patrick, L.B.|title=Secondary succession in an experimentally fragmented landscape: Community patterns across space and time|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/catalog/37947|publisher=The U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref>\n[[File:Secondary succesion cm01.jpg|thumb|left|''Secondary succession'': trees are colonizing uncultivated fields and meadows.]]\n\nSecondary succession can quickly change a landscape. In the 1900s, [[Acadia National Park]] had a wildfire that destroyed much of the landscape. Originally evergreen trees grew in the landscape. After the fire, the area took at least a year to grow shrubs. Eventually, deciduous trees started to grow instead of evergreens.<ref name=biologydictionary />\n\nSecondary succession has been occurring in [[Shenandoah National Park]] following the 1995 flood of the [[Moorman's River|Moorman's]] and Rapidan rivers, which destroyed plant and animal life.<ref>\n{{cite news\n| url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1995-07-23-1995204058-story.html\n| title=Floods change face of Shenandoah park\n| first=Sandy\n| last=Banisky\n| date=July 3, 1995\n| accessdate=2019-07-05\n| newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]\n}}</ref>\n\n\n===Seasonal and cyclic dynamics===\nUnlike secondary succession, these types of vegetation change are not dependent on [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] but are periodic changes arising from fluctuating species interactions or recurring events. These models modify the [[climax community|climax concept]] towards one of dynamic states.\n\n===Causes of plant succession===\n\n[[Autogenic succession]] can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, or change in the pH of soil due to the plants growing there. The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.\n\n[[Allogenic succession]] is caused by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.\n\nClimatic factors may be very important, but on a much longer time-scale than any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in communities. As the climate warmed at the end of each ice age, great successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The [[greenhouse effect]] resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound Allogenic changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high wind also bring allogenic changes.\n\n===Mechanisms===\n\nIn 1916, [[Frederic Clements]] published a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general ecological concept.<ref name=Clements/> His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. Clements' concept is usually termed classical [[ecological theory]].\nAccording to Clements, succession is a process involving several phases:<ref name=Clements/>{{page needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n# Nudation: Succession begins with the development of a bare site, called Nudation (disturbance).<ref name=Clements/>\n# Migration: refers to arrival of [[propagule]]s.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Ecesis: involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Competition: as vegetation becomes well established, grows, and spreads, various species begin to compete for space, light and nutrients.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Reaction: during this phase autogenic changes such as the buildup of humus affect the habitat, and one plant community replaces another.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Stabilization: a supposedly stable climax community forms.<ref name=Clements/>\n\n==Seral communities==\n\n{{main|Seral community}}\n[[File:Pond sucession.svg|thumb|400px|Pond succession or sere A: emergent plant life B: sediment C: Emergent plants grow inwards, sediment accretes D: emergent and terrestrial plants E: sediment fills pond, terrestrial plants take over F: trees grow]]\n[[File:Schleienloecher2-1- C.jpg|thumb|A [[hydrosere]] community]]\n\nA seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards its [[climax community]]. In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained.<ref>Michael G. Barbour and William Dwight Billings (2000) ''North American Terrestrial Vegetation'', Cambridge University Press, 708 pages {{ISBN|0-521-55986-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-55986-7}}</ref> A ''[[prisere]]'' is a collection of seres making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax community. Depending on the substratum and climate, different seres are found.\n\n==Changes in animal life==\nSuccession theory was developed primarily by botanists. The study of succession applied to whole [[ecosystems]] initiated in the writings of [[Ramon Margalef]], while [[Eugene Odum]]\u2019s publication of ''The Strategy of Ecosystem Development'' is considered its formal starting point.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in Changing Environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9-780521-398435|page=4}}</ref>\n\nAnimal life also exhibit changes with changing communities. In lichen stage the fauna is sparse. It comprises few mites, ants and spiders living in the cracks and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during herb grass stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insects larvae, ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies with the development of forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates like slugs, snails, worms, millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and frogs.\n\n==Microsuccession==\n\nSuccession of [[micro-organisms]] including [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] occurring within a microhabitat is known as microsuccession or serule. Like in plants, microbial succession can occur in newly available habitats ([[primary succession]]) such as surfaces of plant leaves, recently exposed rock surfaces (i.e., glacial till) or animal infant guts,<ref name=\":0\" /> and also on disturbed communities ([[secondary succession]]) like those growing in recently dead trees or animal droppings. Microbial communities may also change due to products secreted by the bacteria present. Changes of pH in a habitat could provide ideal conditions for a new species to inhabit the area. In some cases the new species may outcompete the present ones for nutrients leading to the primary species demise. Changes can also occur by microbial succession with variations in water availability and temperature. Theories of [[macroecology]] have only recently been applied to [[microbiology]] and so much remains to be understood about this growing field. A recent study of microbial succession evaluated the balances between [[stochastic]] and deterministic processes in the bacterial colonization of a salt marsh [[chronosequence]]. The results of this study show that, much like in macro succession, early colonization ([[primary succession]]) is mostly influenced by stochasticity while secondary succession of these bacterial communities was more strongly influenced by deterministic factors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dini-Andreote |first1=Francisco |last2=Stegen |first2=James |last3=Dirk van Elsas |first3=Jan |last4=Falc\u00e3o Salles |first4=Joana|title=Disentangling mechanisms that mediate the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in microbial succession|journal=PNAS |date=17 March 2015 |volume=112 |issue=11 |pages=E1326\u2013E1332 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1414261112|pmid=25733885 |pmc=4371938 }}</ref>\n\n==Climax concept==\nAccording to classical [[ecological theory]], succession stops when the sere has arrived at an equilibrium or steady state with the physical and biotic environment. Barring major disturbances, it will persist indefinitely. This end point of succession is called climax.\n\n===Climax community===\n{{main|Climax community}}\n\nThe final or stable community in a sere is the ''climax community'' or ''climatic vegetation''. It is self-perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of organic matter in a climax community. The annual production and use of energy is balanced in such a community.\n\n===Characteristics===\n\n* The vegetation is tolerant of environmental conditions.\n* It has a wide diversity of species, a well-drained spatial structure, and complex food chains.\n* The climax ecosystem is balanced. There is equilibrium between [[gross primary production]] and total respiration, between energy used from sunlight and energy released by decomposition, between uptake of nutrients from the soil and the return of nutrient by litter fall to the soil.\n* Individuals in the climax stage are replaced by others of the same kind. Thus the species composition maintains equilibrium.\n* It is an index of the climate of the area. The life or growth forms indicate the climatic type.\n\n===Types of climax===\n\n; Climatic Climax: If there is only a single climax and the development of climax community is controlled by the climate of the region, it is termed as climatic climax. For example, development of Maple-beech climax community over moist soil. Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical conditions of the substrate are not so extreme as to modify the effects of the prevailing regional climate.\n; Edaphic Climax: When there are more than one climax communities in the region, modified by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity, it is called ''edaphic climax''. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop.\n; Catastrophic Climax: Climax vegetation vulnerable to a catastrophic event such as a wildfire. For example, in [[California]], [[chaparral]] vegetation is the final vegetation. The wildfire removes the mature vegetation and decomposers. A rapid development of herbaceous vegetation follows until the shrub dominance is re-established. This is known as catastrophic climax.\n; Disclimax: When a stable community, which is not the climatic or edaphic climax for the given site, is maintained by man or his domestic animals, it is designated as Disclimax (disturbance climax) or anthropogenic subclimax (man-generated). For example, [[overgrazing]] by stock may produce a desert community of bushes and cacti where the local climate actually would allow grassland to maintain itself.\n; Subclimax: The prolonged stage in succession just preceding the climatic climax is ''subclimax''.\n; Preclimax and Postclimax: In certain areas different climax communities develop under similar climatic conditions. If the community has life forms lower than those in the expected climatic climax, it is called ''preclimax''; a community that has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic climax is ''postclimax''. Preclimax strips develop in less moist and hotter areas, whereas Postclimax strands develop in more moist and cooler areas than that of surrounding climate.\n\n===Theories===\n\nThere are three schools of interpretations explaining the climax concept:\n\n* Monoclimax or Climatic Climax Theory was advanced by [[Frederic Clements|Clements]] (1916) and recognizes only one climax whose characteristics are determined solely by climate (climatic climax). The processes of succession and modification of environment overcome the effects of differences in topography, parent material of the soil, and other factors. The whole area would be covered with uniform plant community. Communities other than the climax are related to it, and are recognized as subclimax, postclimax and disclimax.\n* Polyclimax Theory was advanced by Tansley (1935). It proposes that the climax vegetation of a region consists of more than one vegetation climaxes controlled by soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity.\n* Climax Pattern Theory was proposed by Whittaker (1953). The climax pattern theory recognizes a variety of climaxes governed by responses of species populations to biotic and abiotic conditions. According to this theory the total environment of the ecosystem determines the composition, species structure, and balance of a climax community. The environment includes the species responses to moisture, temperature, and nutrients, their biotic relationships, availability of flora and fauna to colonize the area, chance dispersal of seeds and animals, soils, climate, and disturbance such as fire and wind. The nature of climax vegetation will change as the environment changes. The climax community represents a pattern of populations that corresponds to and changes with the pattern of environment. The central and most widespread community is the climatic climax.\n\nThe theory of [[alternative stable states]] suggests there is not one end point but many which transition between each other over ecological time.\n\n==Forest succession==\n[[File:Forest succession depicted over time.png|thumb|400px]]\nThe forests, being an ecological system, are subject to the species succession process.<ref>McEvoy, Thom, ''Positive Impact Forestry'', p 32 \"Species Succession and Tolerance\", Island Press, 2004</ref> There are \"opportunistic\" or \"pioneer\" species that produce great quantities of seed that are disseminated by the wind, and therefore can colonize big empty extensions. They are capable of germinating and growing in direct sunlight. Once they have produced a ''[[closed canopy]]'', the lack of direct sun radiation at the soil makes it difficult for their own seedlings to develop. It is then the opportunity for [[shade-tolerant]] species to become established under the protection of the pioneers. When the pioneers die, the shade-tolerant species replace them. These species are capable of growing beneath the canopy, and therefore, in the absence of catastrophes, will stay. For this reason it is then said the [[Stand level modelling|stand]] has reached its climax. When a catastrophe occurs, the opportunity for the pioneers opens up again, provided they are present or within a reasonable range.\n\nAn example of pioneer species, in forests of northeastern North America are ''Betula papyrifera'' ([[White birch]]) and ''Prunus serotina'' ([[Black cherry]]), that are particularly well-adapted to exploit large gaps in forest canopies, but are intolerant of shade and are eventually replaced by other [[shade-tolerant]] species in the absence of disturbances that create such gaps.\n\nThings in nature are not black and white, and there are intermediate stages. It is therefore normal that between the two extremes of light and shade there is a gradient, and there are species that may act as pioneer or tolerant, depending on the circumstances. It is of paramount importance to know the tolerance of species in order to practice an effective [[silviculture]].\n\n==See also==\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n{{portal|Ecology|Biology|Environment}}\n</div>\n* [[Connell\u2013Slatyer model of ecological succession]]\n* [[Cyclic succession]]\n* [[Ecological stability]]\n* [[Intermediate disturbance hypothesis]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite journal |last=Connell |first=J.

Inspired by studies of [[Denmark|Danish]] dunes by [[Eugen Warming]], Cowles studied [[vegetation]] development on sand dunes on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] (the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|Indiana Dunes]]). He recognized that vegetation on dunes of different ages might be interpreted as different stages of a general trend of vegetation development on dunes (an approach to the study of vegetation change later termed space-for-time substitution, or [[chronosequence]] studies). He first published this work as a paper in the ''Botanical Gazette'' in 1899 (\"The ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes of Lake Michigan\").<ref name=Cowles>{{cite journal |date=1899 |author=E.C.

Clements explicitly analogized the successional development of ecological communities with ontogenetic development of individual organisms, and his model is often referred to as the pseudo-organismic theory of community ecology. Clements and his followers developed a complex taxonomy of communities and successional pathways.\n\n[[Henry Gleason]] offered a contrasting framework as early as the 1920s. The Gleasonian model was more complex and much less deterministic than the Clementsian. It differs most fundamentally from the Clementsian view in suggesting a much greater role of [[Stochastic process|chance factors]] and in denying the existence of coherent, sharply bounded community types. Gleason argued that species distributions responded individualistically to environmental factors, and communities were best regarded as artifacts of the juxtaposition of species distributions. Gleason's ideas, first published in 1926, were largely ignored until the late 1950s.\n\nTwo quotes illustrate the contrasting views of Clements and Gleason. Clements wrote in 1916:\n\n{{quote|The developmental study of vegetation necessarily rests upon the assumption that the unit or climax formation is an organic entity. As an organism the formation arises, grows, matures, and dies. Furthermore, each climax formation is able to reproduce itself, repeating with essential fidelity the stages of its development.|Frederic Clements<ref name=Clements>Clements, Frederic E. (1916) ''Plant succession: an analysis of the development of vegetation''</ref>}}\nwhile Gleason, in his 1926 paper, said:\n{{quote|An association is not an organism, scarcely even a vegetational unit, but merely a coincidence.|Henry Gleason<ref>Gleason, Henry A.(1926) The individualistic concept of the plant association. The Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club</ref>}}\n\nGleason's ideas were, in fact, more consistent with Cowles' original thinking about succession. About Clements' distinction between [[primary succession]] and [[secondary succession]], [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Cowles]] wrote (1911):\n\n{{quote|This classification seems not to be of fundamental value, since it separates such closely related phenomena as those of erosion and deposition, and it places together such unlike things as human agencies and the subsidence of land.|Henry Cowles<ref>[[Henry C. Cowles|Cowles, Henry C.]] (1911) The causes of vegetational cycles. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 1 (1): 3-20 [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2560843]</ref>}}\n\n===Modern era===\nA more rigorous, data-driven testing of successional models and community theory generally began with the work of [[Robert Whittaker]] and [[John Curtis (biologist)|John Curtis]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Succession theory has since become less monolithic and more complex. [[Connell\u2013Slatyer model of ecological succession|J. Connell and R. Slatyer]] attempted a codification of successional processes by mechanism. Among British and North American ecologists, the notion of a stable [[climax vegetation]] has been largely abandoned, and successional processes have come to be seen as much less deterministic, with important roles for historical [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] and for alternate pathways in the actual development of communities. Debates continue as to the general predictability of successional dynamics and the relative importance of equilibrial vs. non-equilibrial processes. Former Harvard professor F. A. Bazzaz introduced the notion of ''scale'' into the discussion, as he considered that at local or small area scale the processes are stochastic and patchy, but taking bigger regional areas into consideration, certain tendencies can not be denied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9-780521-398435|pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Factors==\n\nThe trajectory of successional change can be influenced by site conditions, by the character of the events initiating succession (perturbations), by the interactions of the species present, and by more [[stochastic]] factors such as availability of colonists or seeds or [[weather]] conditions at the time of disturbance. Some of these factors contribute to predictability of succession dynamics; others add more [[probability|probabilistic]] elements. Two important perturbation factors today are [[Human impact on the environment|human actions]] and [[Global warming|climatic change]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in changing environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=9-780521-398435|page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn general, communities in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-[[biological dispersal|dispersed]] species ([[opportunist]], [[fugitive]], or [[r-selected]] life-histories). As succession proceeds, these species will tend to be replaced by more competitive ([[k-selected]]) species.\n\nTrends in [[ecosystem]] and community properties in succession have been suggested, but few appear to be general. For example, [[species diversity]] almost necessarily increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in later succession as competition eliminates opportunistic species and leads to [[Competitive exclusion principle|dominance by locally superior competitors]]. [[Primary production|Net Primary Productivity]], [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] properties all show variable patterns over succession, depending on the particular system and site.\n\nEcological succession was formerly seen as having a stable end-stage called the [[Climax community|climax]], sometimes referred to as the 'potential vegetation' of a site, and shaped primarily by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of ecosystems dynamics. Most natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a \"climax\" community unattainable. [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]] often occurs at a rate and frequency sufficient to prevent arrival at a climax state. Additions to available species pools through range expansions and [[Introduced species|introductions]] can also continually reshape communities.\n\nThe development of some ecosystem attributes, such as [[pedogenesis|soil properties]] and [[nutrient cycles]], are both influenced by community properties, and, in turn, influence further successional development. This feed-back process may occur only over centuries or millennia. Coupled with the [[stochastic]] nature of disturbance events and other long-term (e.g., climatic) changes, such dynamics make it doubtful whether the 'climax' concept ever applies or is particularly useful in considering actual vegetation.\n\n==Types==\n{{main|Primary succession|Secondary succession|Cyclic succession}}\n\n===Primary succession===\nSuccessional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area that has not been previously occupied by an ecological community, such as newly exposed rock or sand surfaces, lava flows, newly exposed glacial tills, etc., are referred to as primary succession.

Dynamics in secondary succession are strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions, including soil development, seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms. Because of residual fertility and pre-existing organisms, community change in early stages of secondary succession can be relatively rapid.\n\nSecondary succession is much more commonly observed and studied than primary succession. Particularly common types of secondary succession include responses to natural disturbances such as fire, flood, and severe winds, and to human-caused disturbances such as logging and agriculture. In secondary succession, the soils and organisms need to be left unharmed so there is a way for the new material to rebuild.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs an example, in a fragmented old field habitat created in eastern Kansas, woody plants \"colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Cook, W.M. |author2=Yao, J.|author3= Foster, B.L.|author4=Holt, R.D. |author5=Patrick, L.B.|title=Secondary succession in an experimentally fragmented landscape: Community patterns across space and time|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/catalog/37947|publisher=The U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref>\n[[File:Secondary succesion cm01.jpg|thumb|left|''Secondary succession'': trees are colonizing uncultivated fields and meadows.]]\n\nSecondary succession can quickly change a landscape. In the 1900s, [[Acadia National Park]] had a wildfire that destroyed much of the landscape. Originally evergreen trees grew in the landscape. After the fire, the area took at least a year to grow shrubs. Eventually, deciduous trees started to grow instead of evergreens.<ref name=biologydictionary />\n\nSecondary succession has been occurring in [[Shenandoah National Park]] following the 1995 flood of the [[Moorman's River|Moorman's]] and Rapidan rivers, which destroyed plant and animal life.<ref>\n{{cite news\n| url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1995-07-23-1995204058-story.html\n| title=Floods change face of Shenandoah park\n| first=Sandy\n| last=Banisky\n| date=July 3, 1995\n| accessdate=2019-07-05\n| newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]\n}}</ref>\n\n\n===Seasonal and cyclic dynamics===\nUnlike secondary succession, these types of vegetation change are not dependent on [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] but are periodic changes arising from fluctuating species interactions or recurring events. These models modify the [[climax community|climax concept]] towards one of dynamic states.\n\n===Causes of plant succession===\n\n[[Autogenic succession]] can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, or change in the pH of soil due to the plants growing there. The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.\n\n[[Allogenic succession]] is caused by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.\n\nClimatic factors may be very important, but on a much longer time-scale than any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in communities. As the climate warmed at the end of each ice age, great successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The [[greenhouse effect]] resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound Allogenic changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high wind also bring allogenic changes.\n\n===Mechanisms===\n\nIn 1916, [[Frederic Clements]] published a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general ecological concept.<ref name=Clements/> His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. Clements' concept is usually termed classical [[ecological theory]].\nAccording to Clements, succession is a process involving several phases:<ref name=Clements/>{{page needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n# Nudation: Succession begins with the development of a bare site, called Nudation (disturbance).<ref name=Clements/>\n# Migration: refers to arrival of [[propagule]]s.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Ecesis: involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Competition: as vegetation becomes well established, grows, and spreads, various species begin to compete for space, light and nutrients.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Reaction: during this phase autogenic changes such as the buildup of humus affect the habitat, and one plant community replaces another.<ref name=Clements/>\n# Stabilization: a supposedly stable climax community forms.<ref name=Clements/>\n\n==Seral communities==\n\n{{main|Seral community}}\n[[File:Pond sucession.svg|thumb|400px|Pond succession or sere A: emergent plant life B: sediment C: Emergent plants grow inwards, sediment accretes D: emergent and terrestrial plants E: sediment fills pond, terrestrial plants take over F: trees grow]]\n[[File:Schleienloecher2-1- C.jpg|thumb|A [[hydrosere]] community]]\n\nA seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards its [[climax community]]. In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained.<ref>Michael G. Barbour and William Dwight Billings (2000) ''North American Terrestrial Vegetation'', Cambridge University Press, 708 pages {{ISBN|0-521-55986-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-55986-7}}</ref> A ''[[prisere]]'' is a collection of seres making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax community. Depending on the substratum and climate, different seres are found.\n\n==Changes in animal life==\nSuccession theory was developed primarily by botanists. The study of succession applied to whole [[ecosystems]] initiated in the writings of [[Ramon Margalef]], while [[Eugene Odum]]\u2019s publication of ''The Strategy of Ecosystem Development'' is considered its formal starting point.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in Changing Environments|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9-780521-398435|page=4}}</ref>\n\nAnimal life also exhibit changes with changing communities. In lichen stage the fauna is sparse. It comprises few mites, ants and spiders living in the cracks and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during herb grass stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insects larvae, ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies with the development of forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates like slugs, snails, worms, millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and frogs.\n\n==Microsuccession==\n\nSuccession of [[micro-organisms]] including [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] occurring within a microhabitat is known as microsuccession or serule. Like in plants, microbial succession can occur in newly available habitats ([[primary succession]]) such as surfaces of plant leaves, recently exposed rock surfaces (i.e., glacial till) or animal infant guts,<ref name=\":0\" /> and also on disturbed communities ([[secondary succession]]) like those growing in recently dead trees or animal droppings. Microbial communities may also change due to products secreted by the bacteria present. Changes of pH in a habitat could provide ideal conditions for a new species to inhabit the area. In some cases the new species may outcompete the present ones for nutrients leading to the primary species demise. Changes can also occur by microbial succession with variations in water availability and temperature. Theories of [[macroecology]] have only recently been applied to [[microbiology]] and so much remains to be understood about this growing field. A recent study of microbial succession evaluated the balances between [[stochastic]] and deterministic processes in the bacterial colonization of a salt marsh [[chronosequence]]. The results of this study show that, much like in macro succession, early colonization ([[primary succession]]) is mostly influenced by stochasticity while secondary succession of these bacterial communities was more strongly influenced by deterministic factors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dini-Andreote |first1=Francisco |last2=Stegen |first2=James |last3=Dirk van Elsas |first3=Jan |last4=Falc\u00e3o Salles |first4=Joana|title=Disentangling mechanisms that mediate the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in microbial succession|journal=PNAS |date=17 March 2015 |volume=112 |issue=11 |pages=E1326\u2013E1332 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1414261112|pmid=25733885 |pmc=4371938 }}</ref>\n\n==Climax concept==\nAccording to classical [[ecological theory]], succession stops when the sere has arrived at an equilibrium or steady state with the physical and biotic environment. Barring major disturbances, it will persist indefinitely. This end point of succession is called climax.\n\n===Climax community===\n{{main|Climax community}}\n\nThe final or stable community in a sere is the ''climax community'' or ''climatic vegetation''. It is self-perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of organic matter in a climax community. The annual production and use of energy is balanced in such a community.\n\n===Characteristics===\n\n* The vegetation is tolerant of environmental conditions.\n* It has a wide diversity of species, a well-drained spatial structure, and complex food chains.\n* The climax ecosystem is balanced. There is equilibrium between [[gross primary production]] and total respiration, between energy used from sunlight and energy released by decomposition, between uptake of nutrients from the soil and the return of nutrient by litter fall to the soil.\n* Individuals in the climax stage are replaced by others of the same kind. Thus the species composition maintains equilibrium.\n* It is an index of the climate of the area. The life or growth forms indicate the climatic type.\n\n===Types of climax===\n\n; Climatic Climax: If there is only a single climax and the development of climax community is controlled by the climate of the region, it is termed as climatic climax. For example, development of Maple-beech climax community over moist soil. Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical conditions of the substrate are not so extreme as to modify the effects of the prevailing regional climate.\n; Edaphic Climax: When there are more than one climax communities in the region, modified by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity, it is called ''edaphic climax''. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop.\n; Catastrophic Climax: Climax vegetation vulnerable to a catastrophic event such as a wildfire. For example, in [[California]], [[chaparral]] vegetation is the final vegetation. The wildfire removes the mature vegetation and decomposers. A rapid development of herbaceous vegetation follows until the shrub dominance is re-established. This is known as catastrophic climax.\n; Disclimax: When a stable community, which is not the climatic or edaphic climax for the given site, is maintained by man or his domestic animals, it is designated as Disclimax (disturbance climax) or anthropogenic subclimax (man-generated). For example, [[overgrazing]] by stock may produce a desert community of bushes and cacti where the local climate actually would allow grassland to maintain itself.\n; Subclimax: The prolonged stage in succession just preceding the climatic climax is ''subclimax''.\n; Preclimax and Postclimax: In certain areas different climax communities develop under similar climatic conditions. If the community has life forms lower than those in the expected climatic climax, it is called ''preclimax''; a community that has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic climax is ''postclimax''. Preclimax strips develop in less moist and hotter areas, whereas Postclimax strands develop in more moist and cooler areas than that of surrounding climate.\n\n===Theories===\n\nThere are three schools of interpretations explaining the climax concept:\n\n* Monoclimax or Climatic Climax Theory was advanced by [[Frederic Clements|Clements]] (1916) and recognizes only one climax whose characteristics are determined solely by climate (climatic climax). The processes of succession and modification of environment overcome the effects of differences in topography, parent material of the soil, and other factors. The whole area would be covered with uniform plant community. Communities other than the climax are related to it, and are recognized as subclimax, postclimax and disclimax.\n* Polyclimax Theory was advanced by Tansley (1935). It proposes that the climax vegetation of a region consists of more than one vegetation climaxes controlled by soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity.\n* Climax Pattern Theory was proposed by Whittaker (1953). The climax pattern theory recognizes a variety of climaxes governed by responses of species populations to biotic and abiotic conditions. According to this theory the total environment of the ecosystem determines the composition, species structure, and balance of a climax community. The environment includes the species responses to moisture, temperature, and nutrients, their biotic relationships, availability of flora and fauna to colonize the area, chance dispersal of seeds and animals, soils, climate, and disturbance such as fire and wind. The nature of climax vegetation will change as the environment changes. The climax community represents a pattern of populations that corresponds to and changes with the pattern of environment. The central and most widespread community is the climatic climax.\n\nThe theory of [[alternative stable states]] suggests there is not one end point but many which transition between each other over ecological time.\n\n==Forest succession==\n[[File:Forest succession depicted over time.png|thumb|400px]]\nThe forests, being an ecological system, are subject to the species succession process.<ref>McEvoy, Thom, ''Positive Impact Forestry'', p 32 \"Species Succession and Tolerance\", Island Press, 2004</ref> There are \"opportunistic\" or \"pioneer\" species that produce great quantities of seed that are disseminated by the wind, and therefore can colonize big empty extensions. They are capable of germinating and growing in direct sunlight. Once they have produced a ''[[closed canopy]]'', the lack of direct sun radiation at the soil makes it difficult for their own seedlings to develop. It is then the opportunity for [[shade-tolerant]] species to become established under the protection of the pioneers. When the pioneers die, the shade-tolerant species replace them. These species are capable of growing beneath the canopy, and therefore, in the absence of catastrophes, will stay. For this reason it is then said the [[Stand level modelling|stand]] has reached its climax. When a catastrophe occurs, the opportunity for the pioneers opens up again, provided they are present or within a reasonable range.\n\nAn example of pioneer species, in forests of northeastern North America are ''Betula papyrifera'' ([[White birch]]) and ''Prunus serotina'' ([[Black cherry]]), that are particularly well-adapted to exploit large gaps in forest canopies, but are intolerant of shade and are eventually replaced by other [[shade-tolerant]] species in the absence of disturbances that create such gaps.\n\nThings in nature are not black and white, and there are intermediate stages. It is therefore normal that between the two extremes of light and shade there is a gradient, and there are species that may act as pioneer or tolerant, depending on the circumstances. It is of paramount importance to know the tolerance of species in order to practice an effective [[silviculture]].\n\n==See also==\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n{{portal|Ecology|Biology|Environment}}\n</div>\n* [[Connell\u2013Slatyer model of ecological succession]]\n* [[Cyclic succession]]\n* [[Ecological stability]]\n* [[Intermediate disturbance hypothesis]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite journal |last=Connell |first=J.

The Avenue of the Saints heads west, to [[Chesterfield, Missouri|Chesterfield]], crossing [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|I&#8209;270]]. Here, the Avenue of the Saints turns northwest, crosses the [[Missouri River]] via the Daniel Boone Bridge. In [[Wentzville, Missouri|Wentzville]], the route interchanges with [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I&#8209;70]]. The western end of I&#8209;64 and the northern end of the concurrency with US&nbsp;40 is here. The Avenue of the Saints continues north as just US&nbsp;61, intersects with the western end of [[Interstate 72 in Missouri|I&#8209;72]] in [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]], reaches the northern terminus&nbsp;of its concurrency with US&nbsp;61, then crosses the [[Des Moines River]] into [[Iowa]].\n\nThe Avenue of the Saints is co-signed with '''Missouri Route 27''' to the Iowa state line.\n\n===Iowa===\nIn Iowa, the Avenue of the Saints is a {{convert|282|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}}<ref name=IowaDOT>{{IowaDOT|2011-01-14|year=2009}}</ref> highway, which begins in [[Lee County, Iowa|Lee County]] where Missouri Route 27 crosses the Des Moines River, and ends at the Minnesota state line in [[Worth County, Iowa|Worth County]], concurrent with [[Interstate 35]]. Construction of the Avenue of the Saints corridor in Iowa was completed on May 23, 2006.\n\nThe route runs north from the Missouri state line as just Iowa Highway 27 for about {{convert|10|mi|spell=in}}, then is co-signed with US&nbsp;218 until just south of Cedar Rapids, crossing [[Interstate 80 in Iowa|I&#8209;80]] in Iowa City. This is also the location of the southern end of its concurrency with I&#8209;380, and this concurrency terminates in Waterloo. Near [[Floyd, Iowa|Floyd]], US&nbsp;218 splits off, just after the route starts a concurrency with US&nbsp;18, running west to its intersection with [[Interstate 35 in Iowa|I&#8209;35]], where the route turns north again and runs into Minnesota.\n\nIn 2001, the Iowa Department of Transportation designated the Avenue of the Saints as '''Iowa&nbsp;27'''. Prior to its creation, motorists wanting to travel the Avenue through Iowa had to follow a lengthy list of directions: ''(heading north from Missouri)'' [[Iowa Highway 394|Iowa&nbsp;394]], [[US&nbsp;218]], I&#8209;380, US&nbsp;20, Iowa&nbsp;58, US&nbsp;218 (again), US&nbsp;18 and I&#8209;35.\n\nAs with many rural [[Limited-access road|expressways]] in Iowa, the Avenue of the Saints has [[exit number]]s in that state. The exit numbers correspond to the underlying [[U.S. Highway]] or [[Interstate Highway]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[US&nbsp;218]], [[Interstate 380 in Iowa|I&#8209;380]], [[U.S. Route 20 in Iowa|US&nbsp;20]], [[U.S. Route 18 in Iowa|US&nbsp;18]] and I&#8209;35. The section along Iowa&nbsp;58 in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]] has no exit numbers, and the separate section south of [[Donnellson, Iowa|Donnellson]] has one numbered exit\u2014the northbound one to US&nbsp;218 south\u2014based on Iowa&nbsp;27's mileage.\n\n===Minnesota===\n{{Main article|Interstate 35 in Minnesota}}\n\nIn Minnesota, the Avenue of the Saints is officially routed along [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|I&#8209;35]] and [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I&#8209;35E]] for the entirety of its length in that state, but is not marked anywhere within the state. The route runs straight north, crosses [[Interstate 90 in Minnesota|I&#8209;90]] in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota|Albert Lea]], and runs to its northern end in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], shortly after crossing the [[Mississippi River]] via the Lexington Bridge.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe Avenue of the Saints was the concept of businessman Ernest Hayes of [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], Iowa who in the 1980s envisioned a four-lane highway between St. Paul and St. Louis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Petroski |first=William |date=April 30, 1990 |title=Saints highway marketing idea proves popular |page=A2 |work=[[Des Moines Register]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20349586/saints_highway_name/ |via=Newspapers.com |accessdate=May 24, 2018}} {{open access}}</ref> It was named by Gary Smith, who at the time was Executive Director of the Southeast Iowa Regional Planning Commission. Smith and Hayes convened a group of area business and political leaders, who organized an effort to convince the [[Iowa Department of Transportation]] to study the idea, which they did in 1988. Smith later wrote and recorded a song entitled Ave of Saints https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiy9EJtBSfE&feature=youtu.be Several politicians endorsed the idea, including then-mayor [[Tom Vilsack]] of Mount Pleasant, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]] of Iowa, and [[United States House of Representatives|Congressmen]] [[David Nagle]] and [[Fred Grandy]] of Iowa and [[Dick Gephardt]] of Missouri.\n\nBy the end of 1989, four possible routes for the Avenue of the Saints were under consideration by the [[Federal Highway Administration]]. Two of the rejected routes would have followed [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] and [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] from St. Paul through [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], Minnesota, to [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], Iowa. The third rejected route would have followed [[U.S. Route 61|US&nbsp;61]] from St. Paul through [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], Iowa to [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], Iowa and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] from Davenport, crossing the [[Mississippi River]] through western [[Illinois]] to [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], Illinois and crossing the Mississippi and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers to St. Louis.\n\nIn 1990 the FHWA chose its route for the Avenue of the Saints: the signed highway would follow the existing [[Interstate 35]] from St. Paul to a point south of [[Clear Lake, Iowa|Clear Lake]], Iowa; [[U.S. Route 18 in Iowa|U.S. Route 18]] to [[Charles City, Iowa|Charles City]], Iowa; [[U.S. Route 218 in Iowa|U.S. Route 218]] to [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], Iowa; [[U.S. Route 20 in Iowa|U.S. Route 20]] and [[Iowa Highway 58]] around Cedar Falls and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], Iowa; [[Interstate 380 (Iowa)|Interstate 380]] from Waterloo through Cedar Rapids to [[Interstate 80 in Iowa|Interstate 80]] near Coralville, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; U.S. Route 218 to [[Donnellson, Iowa]]; [[Iowa Highway 394]] and Route B to [[Wayland, Missouri|Wayland]], Missouri; and [[Interstate 64 in Missouri|Interstate 64]] and [[U.S. Route 61 in Missouri|U.S. Route 61]] from Wayland to St. Louis.\n\nThe [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991 made the Avenue of the Saints an official \"high-priority corridor,\" and signs were put along the route by the end of the year. At that time the only four-lane segments were I&#8209;35, I&#8209;380, and I&#8209;64; US&nbsp;20 around Waterloo; US&nbsp;218 from I&#8209;80 to Iowa&nbsp;22 near [[Riverside, Iowa|Riverside]], Iowa; and two segments of US&nbsp;61 in Missouri (from [[La Grange, Missouri|La Grange]] to [[New London, Missouri|New London]] and from [[Bowling Green, Missouri|Bowling Green]] to St. Louis). As a cost-saving measure, the government decided to build the Avenue of the Saints to expressway standards\u2014with intersections at rural roads\u2014rather than to full [[freeway]] standards. Freeway segments would be built around cities that needed to be bypassed.\n\nAfter the routing was approved, both Iowa and Missouri began constructing new four-lane segments. Iowa opened bypasses around [[Waverly, Iowa|Waverly]] (1998), [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] (1999), Charles City (2000), Mount Pleasant (2001), and Donnellson (2004). A four-lane link between I&#8209;35 and I&#8209;380 was completed with the opening of a segment near [[Nashua, Iowa|Nashua]] in November 2003. Missouri completed four-lane segments from New London to Bowling Green in November 2000, and from [[Canton, Missouri|Canton]] to La Grange in 2003.\n\nIn 2001, the Iowa Department of Transportation gave the Avenue of the Saints its own highway number: Highway 27 (Iowa&nbsp;27). The number was added as an additional number to the existing routes; however, after the Donnellson bypass opened in 2004, Iowa Highway 394 was [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] and Iowa&nbsp;27 is now a stand-alone highway south of the split with US&nbsp;218. A new four-lane bridge across the Des Moines River was opened at the end of 2004, replacing an existing [[toll bridge]] operated by the [[Wayland Special Road District]]. A new four-lane road between the bridge and US&nbsp;61 south of Wayland, Missouri opened on the same day; it was numbered by Missouri as Route&nbsp;27 to match Iowa's number for the Avenue of the Saints.\n\nIn June 2005, a four-lane segment from the end of the Mount Pleasant bypass to the junction with Iowa Highway 16 east of [[Houghton, Iowa|Houghton]] was opened to four lanes of traffic. The segment of Iowa&nbsp;27 between the split with US&nbsp;218 and the Des Moines River bridge opened to four lanes on August 25, 2005.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The last remaining segment in Iowa was opened to traffic on May 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buehner |first=Kristin |date=June 9, 2006 |title=Communities will celebrate opening Iowa portion of Avenue of the Saints |page=A3 |work=[[Globe Gazette]] |location=Mason City, Iowa |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20349731/iowa_portion_of_avenue_of_the_saints/ |via=Newspapers.com |accessdate=May 24, 2018}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nOn July 25, 2008, the final {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} of highway between the Lewis\u2014Clark county line and Wayland, Missouri, was open to four-lane traffic. A ceremony was held at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 61 in Missouri|US&nbsp;61]] and Route&nbsp;27 to commemorate the completion of the four-lane highway in Missouri. The Avenue of the Saints is now complete from St. Paul to suburban St. Louis.\n\n==Future construction==\nOngoing construction projects and future proposals along the Avenue of the Saints include:\n\n* The upgrading of US&nbsp;61 to interstate standards from I&#8209;70 in Wentzville to Route&nbsp;47 in [[Troy, Missouri|Troy]], Missouri. In 2007, an interchange was installed at Route C in [[Moscow Mills, Missouri|Moscow Mills]], Missouri. Proposals include installing interchanges at Route U in Moscow Mills and South Lincoln Drive just south of Troy.\n* [[Missouri Department of Transportation]] has published initial maps for the Hannibal Expressway, a bypass around Hannibal, Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modot.org/northeast/HannibalBypassMapOptions.htm|title=Hannibal Bypass Maps|publisher=[[Missouri Department of Transportation]]|author=Staff|accessdate=October 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017083312/http://www.modot.org/northeast/HannibalBypassMapOptions.htm|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the maps, the Hannibal Expressway would depart from US&nbsp;61 south of Hannibal, travel in a northwesterly direction toward the Rocket Junction where it would intersect with US&nbsp;36/[[Interstate 72 in Missouri|I&#8209;72]] and US&nbsp;24 West. The Hannibal Expressway would then travel along the current US&nbsp;24 East alignment and re-connect with US&nbsp;61 {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} north of the Rocket Junction. The \"Hannibal Expressway\" project is unfunded. There are seven stoplights along US&nbsp;61 in Hannibal: Red Devil Road/Warren Barrett Drive, Market Street (Business 61), Highway MM (Business 36), West Ely Road, I&#8209;72/US&nbsp;36, Stardust Drrive/Pirate Pride, and Route 168.\n* The [[Iowa Department of Transportation]] has plans to rebuild the Avenue of the Saints interchange with I&#8209;80 and I&#8209;380/US&nbsp;218/Iowa&nbsp;27 in [[Coralville, Iowa|Coralville]]. As the Eastern Iowa region has grown, traffic has increased, and the current arrangement of the interchange with its cloverleaf ramps has been deemed unsafe. The [[Iowa Department of Transportation]] proposes to rebuilt the interchange as a [[turbine interchange]], which will eliminate weaving.

[[Midwestern United States]] that connects [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]].\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Missouri===\nThe southern end of the Avenue of the Saints is at exit 28A of [[Interstate 64 in Missouri|Interstate 64]] (I&#8209;64) /[[U.S. Route 40 in Missouri|U.S. Route 40]] (US&nbsp;40), which is also the southern end of its concurrency with [[U.S. Route 61 in Missouri|US&nbsp;61]]. The Avenue of the Saints heads west, to [[Chesterfield, Missouri|Chesterfield]], crossing [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|I&#8209;270]]. Here, the Avenue of the Saints turns northwest, crosses the [[Missouri River]] via the Daniel Boone Bridge. In [[Wentzville, Missouri|Wentzville]], the route interchanges with [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I&#8209;70]]. The western end of I&#8209;64 and the northern end of the concurrency with US&nbsp;40 is here. The Avenue of the Saints continues north as just US&nbsp;61, intersects with the western end of [[Interstate 72 in Missouri|I&#8209;72]] in [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]], reaches the northern terminus&nbsp;of its concurrency with US&nbsp;61, then crosses the [[Des Moines River]] into [[Iowa]].\n\nThe Avenue of the Saints is co-signed with '''Missouri Route 27''' to the Iowa state line.\n\n===Iowa===\nIn Iowa, the Avenue of the Saints is a {{convert|282|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}}<ref name=IowaDOT>{{IowaDOT|2011-01-14|year=2009}}</ref> highway, which begins in [[Lee County, Iowa|Lee County]] where Missouri Route 27 crosses the Des Moines River, and ends at the Minnesota state line in [[Worth County, Iowa|Worth County]], concurrent with [[Interstate 35]]. Construction of the Avenue of the Saints corridor in Iowa was completed on May 23, 2006.\n\nThe route runs north from the Missouri state line as just Iowa Highway 27 for about {{convert|10|mi|spell=in}}, then is co-signed with US&nbsp;218 until just south of Cedar Rapids, crossing [[Interstate 80 in Iowa|I&#8209;80]] in Iowa City. This is also the location of the southern end of its concurrency with I&#8209;380, and this concurrency terminates in Waterloo. Near [[Floyd, Iowa|Floyd]], US&nbsp;218 splits off, just after the route starts a concurrency with US&nbsp;18, running west to its intersection with [[Interstate 35 in Iowa|I&#8209;35]], where the route turns north again and runs into Minnesota.\n\nIn 2001, the Iowa Department of Transportation designated the Avenue of the Saints as '''Iowa&nbsp;27'''. Prior to its creation, motorists wanting to travel the Avenue through Iowa had to follow a lengthy list of directions: ''(heading north from Missouri)'' [[Iowa Highway 394|Iowa&nbsp;394]], [[US&nbsp;218]], I&#8209;380, US&nbsp;20, Iowa&nbsp;58, US&nbsp;218 (again), US&nbsp;18 and I&#8209;35.\n\nAs with many rural [[Limited-access road|expressways]] in Iowa, the Avenue of the Saints has [[exit number]]s in that state. The exit numbers correspond to the underlying [[U.S. Highway]] or [[Interstate Highway]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[US&nbsp;218]], [[Interstate 380 in Iowa|I&#8209;380]], [[U.S. Route 20 in Iowa|US&nbsp;20]], [[U.S. Route 18 in Iowa|US&nbsp;18]] and I&#8209;35. The section along Iowa&nbsp;58 in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]] has no exit numbers, and the separate section south of [[Donnellson, Iowa|Donnellson]] has one numbered exit\u2014the northbound one to US&nbsp;218 south\u2014based on Iowa&nbsp;27's mileage.\n\n===Minnesota===\n{{Main article|Interstate 35 in Minnesota}}\n\nIn Minnesota, the Avenue of the Saints is officially routed along [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|I&#8209;35]] and [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I&#8209;35E]] for the entirety of its length in that state, but is not marked anywhere within the state. The route runs straight north, crosses [[Interstate 90 in Minnesota|I&#8209;90]] in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota|Albert Lea]], and runs to its northern end in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], shortly after crossing the [[Mississippi River]] via the Lexington Bridge.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe Avenue of the Saints was the concept of businessman Ernest Hayes of [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], Iowa who in the 1980s envisioned a four-lane highway between St. Paul and St. Louis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Petroski |first=William |date=April 30, 1990 |title=Saints highway marketing idea proves popular |page=A2 |work=[[Des Moines Register]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20349586/saints_highway_name/ |via=Newspapers.com |accessdate=May 24, 2018}} {{open access}}</ref> It was named by Gary Smith, who at the time was Executive Director of the Southeast Iowa Regional Planning Commission. Smith and Hayes convened a group of area business and political leaders, who organized an effort to convince the [[Iowa Department of Transportation]] to study the idea, which they did in 1988. Several politicians endorsed the idea, including then-mayor [[Tom Vilsack]] of Mount Pleasant, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]] of Iowa, and [[United States House of Representatives|Congressmen]] [[David Nagle]] and [[Fred Grandy]] of Iowa and [[Dick Gephardt]] of Missouri.\n\nBy the end of 1989, four possible routes for the Avenue of the Saints were under consideration by the [[Federal Highway Administration]]. Two of the rejected routes would have followed [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] and [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] from St. Paul through [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], Minnesota, to [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], Iowa. The third rejected route would have followed [[U.S. Route 61|US&nbsp;61]] from St. Paul through [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], Iowa to [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], Iowa and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] from Davenport, crossing the [[Mississippi River]] through western [[Illinois]] to [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], Illinois and crossing the Mississippi and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers to St. Louis.\n\nIn 1990 the FHWA chose its route for the Avenue of the Saints: the signed highway would follow the existing [[Interstate 35]] from St. Paul to a point south of [[Clear Lake, Iowa|Clear Lake]], Iowa; [[U.S. Route 18 in Iowa|U.S. Route 18]] to [[Charles City, Iowa|Charles City]], Iowa; [[U.S. Route 218 in Iowa|U.S. Route 218]] to [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], Iowa; [[U.S. Route 20 in Iowa|U.S. Route 20]] and [[Iowa Highway 58]] around Cedar Falls and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], Iowa; [[Interstate 380 (Iowa)|Interstate 380]] from Waterloo through Cedar Rapids to [[Interstate 80 in Iowa|Interstate 80]] near Coralville, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; U.S. Route 218 to [[Donnellson, Iowa]]; [[Iowa Highway 394]] and Route B to [[Wayland, Missouri|Wayland]], Missouri; and [[Interstate 64 in Missouri|Interstate 64]] and [[U.S. Route 61 in Missouri|U.S. Route 61]] from Wayland to St. Louis.\n\nThe [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991 made the Avenue of the Saints an official \"high-priority corridor,\" and signs were put along the route by the end of the year. At that time the only four-lane segments were I&#8209;35, I&#8209;380, and I&#8209;64; US&nbsp;20 around Waterloo; US&nbsp;218 from I&#8209;80 to Iowa&nbsp;22 near [[Riverside, Iowa|Riverside]], Iowa; and two segments of US&nbsp;61 in Missouri (from [[La Grange, Missouri|La Grange]] to [[New London, Missouri|New London]] and from [[Bowling Green, Missouri|Bowling Green]] to St. Louis). As a cost-saving measure, the government decided to build the Avenue of the Saints to expressway standards\u2014with intersections at rural roads\u2014rather than to full [[freeway]] standards. Freeway segments would be built around cities that needed to be bypassed.\n\nAfter the routing was approved, both Iowa and Missouri began constructing new four-lane segments. Iowa opened bypasses around [[Waverly, Iowa|Waverly]] (1998), [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] (1999), Charles City (2000), Mount Pleasant (2001), and Donnellson (2004). A four-lane link between I&#8209;35 and I&#8209;380 was completed with the opening of a segment near [[Nashua, Iowa|Nashua]] in November 2003. Missouri completed four-lane segments from New London to Bowling Green in November 2000, and from [[Canton, Missouri|Canton]] to La Grange in 2003.\n\nIn 2001, the Iowa Department of Transportation gave the Avenue of the Saints its own highway number: Highway 27 (Iowa&nbsp;27). The number was added as an additional number to the existing routes; however, after the Donnellson bypass opened in 2004, Iowa Highway 394 was [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] and Iowa&nbsp;27 is now a stand-alone highway south of the split with US&nbsp;218. A new four-lane bridge across the Des Moines River was opened at the end of 2004, replacing an existing [[toll bridge]] operated by the [[Wayland Special Road District]]. A new four-lane road between the bridge and US&nbsp;61 south of Wayland, Missouri opened on the same day; it was numbered by Missouri as Route&nbsp;27 to match Iowa's number for the Avenue of the Saints.\n\nIn June 2005, a four-lane segment from the end of the Mount Pleasant bypass to the junction with Iowa Highway 16 east of [[Houghton, Iowa|Houghton]] was opened to four lanes of traffic. The segment of Iowa&nbsp;27 between the split with US&nbsp;218 and the Des Moines River bridge opened to four lanes on August 25, 2005.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The last remaining segment in Iowa was opened to traffic on May 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buehner |first=Kristin |date=June 9, 2006 |title=Communities will celebrate opening Iowa portion of Avenue of the Saints |page=A3 |work=[[Globe Gazette]] |location=Mason City, Iowa |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20349731/iowa_portion_of_avenue_of_the_saints/ |via=Newspapers.com |accessdate=May 24, 2018}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nOn July 25, 2008, the final {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} of highway between the Lewis\u2014Clark county line and Wayland, Missouri, was open to four-lane traffic. A ceremony was held at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 61 in Missouri|US&nbsp;61]] and Route&nbsp;27 to commemorate the completion of the four-lane highway in Missouri. The Avenue of the Saints is now complete from St. Paul to suburban St. Louis.\n\n==Future construction==\nOngoing construction projects and future proposals along the Avenue of the Saints include:\n\n* The upgrading of US&nbsp;61 to interstate standards from I&#8209;70 in Wentzville to Route&nbsp;47 in [[Troy, Missouri|Troy]], Missouri. In 2007, an interchange was installed at Route C in [[Moscow Mills, Missouri|Moscow Mills]], Missouri. Proposals include installing interchanges at Route U in Moscow Mills and South Lincoln Drive just south of Troy.\n* [[Missouri Department of Transportation]] has published initial maps for the Hannibal Expressway, a bypass around Hannibal, Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modot.org/northeast/HannibalBypassMapOptions.htm|title=Hannibal Bypass Maps|publisher=[[Missouri Department of Transportation]]|author=Staff|accessdate=October 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017083312/http://www.modot.org/northeast/HannibalBypassMapOptions.htm|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the maps, the Hannibal Expressway would depart from US&nbsp;61 south of Hannibal, travel in a northwesterly direction toward the Rocket Junction where it would intersect with US&nbsp;36/[[Interstate 72 in Missouri|I&#8209;72]] and US&nbsp;24 West. The Hannibal Expressway would then travel along the current US&nbsp;24 East alignment and re-connect with US&nbsp;61 {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} north of the Rocket Junction. The \"Hannibal Expressway\" project is unfunded. There are seven stoplights along US&nbsp;61 in Hannibal: Red Devil Road/Warren Barrett Drive, Market Street (Business 61), Highway MM (Business 36), West Ely Road, I&#8209;72/US&nbsp;36, Stardust Drrive/Pirate Pride, and Route 168.\n* The [[Iowa Department of Transportation]] has plans to rebuild the Avenue of the Saints interchange with I&#8209;80 and I&#8209;380/US&nbsp;218/Iowa&nbsp;27 in [[Coralville, Iowa|Coralville]]. As the Eastern Iowa region has grown, traffic has increased, and the current arrangement of the interchange with its cloverleaf ramps has been deemed unsafe. The [[Iowa Department of Transportation]] proposes to rebuilt the interchange as a [[turbine interchange]], which will eliminate weaving. The project is scheduled to begin in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Construction-timeline-for-I-38080-Interchange-480622671.html|title=Construction timeline for I-380/80 Interchange|first=Jordee|last=Kalk|publisher=[[KCRG-TV]]9}}</ref>\n\n==Exits/major intersections==\n{{jcttop|state_col=State|exit|length_ref=<ref name=IowaDOT /><ref name=\"MoDOT\">{{MoDOT Flex|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>|exit_ref=<ref name=IowaDOT /><ref name=\"MoDOT\" />}}\n{{MOint|exit\n | sspan=54\n | county=St. Louis\n | cspan=16\n | location=Frontenac\n | lspan=3\n | type=concur\n | road={{Jct|state=MO|I|64|dir1=East|US|40|dir2=East}}\n | notes=Continuation east beyond interchange;

The firm consulted with local and federal authorities and the applicable law, then offered Sears two options: the [[Goose Island (Chicago)|Goose Island]] area northwest of downtown, and a two-block area bounded by Franklin Street on the east, Jackson Boulevard on the south, Wacker Drive on the west and Adams Street on the north, with Quincy Street running through the middle from east to west.\n\nAfter selection of the latter site, permits to vacate Quincy Street were obtained.<ref>''Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years''</ref> Attorneys from the Arnstein firm, headed by Andrew Adsit, began buying the properties parcel by parcel.<ref>Chicago Tribune, December 28, 2003.</ref>  Sears purchased 15 old buildings from 100 owners and paid $2.7 million to the City of Chicago for the portion of Quincy Street the project absorbed.<ref>Chicago Tribune, January 4, 1971.</ref>\n\nSears, which needed {{convert|3|e6sqft|m2}} of office space for its planned consolidation and predicted growth, commissioned architects [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] (SOM).

The latter floor areas had to be designed to a smaller footprint with a high window-space to floor-space ratio to be attractive to prospective lessees. Smaller floorplates required a taller structure to yield sufficient square footage. Skidmore architects proposed a tower with large, {{convert|55000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} floors in the lower part of the building with gradually tapered floorplates in a series of [[Setback (architecture)|setback]]s, which would give the tower its distinctive look.\n\nAs Sears continued to offer optimistic projections for growth, the tower's proposed floor count increased rapidly into the low hundreds, surpassing the height of New York's unfinished World Trade Center to become the world's tallest building. The height was restricted by a limit imposed by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) to protect air traffic. The financing of the tower was provided by Sears. It was topped with two antennas for television and radio broadcasting. Sears and the City of Chicago approved the design and the first steel was put in place in April 1971. The structure was completed in May 1973. The construction cost about US$150&nbsp;million,<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/sears_tower.html \"Databank: Sears Tower\"], ''Wonders of the World'', PBS Databank.

These elements are louvres to ventilate the building's environmental support systems and obscure its [[truss|belted trusses]]. Even though regulations did not require a fire sprinkler system, the building was equipped with one from the beginning.

The suits alleged that above that point television reception would deteriorate and cause property values to plummet. The first suit was filed by the state attorney in neighboring Lake County on March 17, 1972. A second suit was filed on March 28 in Cook County Circuit Court by the villages of [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]], and [[Deerfield, Illinois]].<ref>Chicago Tribune, April 9, 1972 and Chicago Tribune, May 7, 1972.</ref>\n\nSears filed motions to dismiss the Lake and Cook County lawsuits and on May 17, 1972, Judge LaVerne Dickson, Chief of the [[Lake County Circuit Court]], dismissed the suit, saying, \"I find nothing that gives television viewers the right to reception without interference.

Competition beyond its traditional rivals such as [[Montgomery Ward]] arose from emerging retail giants including [[Kmart]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Walmart]]. As a result of a surplus of office space that emerged in the 1980s, the tower did not draw as many tenants as projected and so stood half-vacant for a decade.\n\nIn 1984, Sears decided to improve the appeal of the lower floors of the tower to pedestrians. Their solution resulted in the addition of a new entryway dubbed by many as the \"[[Willis Tower Lunchbox Entrance|Lunchbox Entrance]].\"\n\nSears looked into selling the Sears Tower in the late 1980s. In July 1990, with no potential buyer apparent, Sears took out a mortgage loan on the tower for $850&nbsp;million from [[MetLife]] and [[AEW Capital Management]], with Metlife as the holder of the mortgage note.

Sears asked its outside counsel, Arnstein, Gluck, Weitzenfeld & Minow (now known as [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]) to suggest a location. The firm consulted with local and federal authorities and the applicable law, then offered Sears two options: the [[Goose Island (Chicago)|Goose Island]] area northwest of downtown, and a two-block area bounded by Franklin Street on the east, Jackson Boulevard on the south, Wacker Drive on the west and Adams Street on the north, with Quincy Street running through the middle from east to west.\n\nAfter selection of the latter site, permits to vacate Quincy Street were obtained.<ref>''Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years''</ref> Attorneys from the Arnstein firm, headed by Andrew Adsit, began buying the properties parcel by parcel.<ref>Chicago Tribune, December 28, 2003.</ref>  Sears purchased 15 old buildings from 100 owners and paid $2.7 million to the City of Chicago for the portion of Quincy Street the project absorbed.<ref>Chicago Tribune, January 4, 1971.</ref>\n\nSears, which needed {{convert|3|e6sqft|m2}} of office space for its planned consolidation and predicted growth, commissioned architects [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] (SOM). Their team of Colombian-Peruvian architect [[Bruce Graham]] and [[East Pakistan|Bangladeshi-Pakistani]] structural engineer [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] designed the building as nine square \"[[Tube (structure)|tubes]]\" (each essentially a separate building), clustered in a 3\u00d73 matrix forming a square base with {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on}} sides.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907406,00.html \"The Tallest Skyscraper\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', June 11, 1973</ref> All nine tubes would rise up to the 50th floor of the building, where the northwest and southeast tubes terminate. The northeast and southwest tubes reach the 66th floor; the north, east, and south tubes end at the 90th.

The latter floor areas had to be designed to a smaller footprint with a high window-space to floor-space ratio to be attractive to prospective lessees. Smaller floorplates required a taller structure to yield sufficient square footage. Skidmore architects proposed a tower with large, {{convert|55000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} floors in the lower part of the building with gradually tapered floorplates in a series of [[Setback (architecture)|setback]]s, which would give the tower its distinctive look.\n\nAs Sears continued to offer optimistic projections for growth, the tower's proposed floor count increased rapidly into the low hundreds, surpassing the height of New York's unfinished World Trade Center to become the world's tallest building. The height was restricted by a limit imposed by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) to protect air traffic. The financing of the tower was provided by Sears. It was topped with two antennas for television and radio broadcasting. Sears and the City of Chicago approved the design and the first steel was put in place in April 1971. The structure was completed in May 1973. The construction cost about US$150&nbsp;million,<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/sears_tower.html \"Databank: Sears Tower\"], ''Wonders of the World'', PBS Databank.

These elements are louvres to ventilate the building's environmental support systems and obscure its [[truss|belted trusses]]. Even though regulations did not require a fire sprinkler system, the building was equipped with one from the beginning. There are around 40,000 sprinkler heads in the building, installed at a cost of $4 million.<ref>The Times-News, February 15, 1975</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, two television antennas were added to the structure, increasing its total height to {{convert|1707|ft|m|1}}.

The suits alleged that above that point television reception would deteriorate and cause property values to plummet. The first suit was filed by the state attorney in neighboring Lake County on March 17, 1972. A second suit was filed on March 28 in Cook County Circuit Court by the villages of [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]], and [[Deerfield, Illinois]].<ref>Chicago Tribune, April 9, 1972 and Chicago Tribune, May 7, 1972.</ref>\n\nSears filed motions to dismiss the Lake and Cook County lawsuits and on May 17, 1972, Judge LaVerne Dickson, Chief of the [[Lake County Circuit Court]], dismissed the suit, saying, \"I find nothing that gives television viewers the right to reception without interference. They will have to find some other means of ensuring reception such as taller antennas.\"<ref>Chicago Tribune, May 18, 1972.</ref> The Lake County state's attorney filed a notice of appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, which ultimately decided in favor of Sears.<ref>Chicago Tribune, June 10, 1972.</ref> In his decision on June 12, Judge Charles R.

On May 26, 1972, the Commission declined to take action on the grounds it did not have jurisdiction.\n\nOn June 30, 1972, the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] affirmed the previous rulings by Lake and Cook County Circuit Courts, by a letter order with a written opinion to follow.<ref>Chicago Tribune, July 1, 1972.</ref> On September 8, 1972, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the FCC decision.<ref>Chicago Tribune, September 12, 1972; ''Illinois Citizens Committee for Broadcasting v.

Competition beyond its traditional rivals such as [[Montgomery Ward]] arose from emerging retail giants including [[Kmart]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Walmart]]. As a result of a surplus of office space that emerged in the 1980s, the tower did not draw as many tenants as projected and so stood half-vacant for a decade. \n\nIn 1984, Sears decided to improve the appeal of the lower floors of the tower to pedestrians. Their solution resulted in the addition of a new entryway dubbed by many as the \"[[Willis Tower Lunchbox Entrance|Lunchbox Entrance]].\" \n\nSears looked into selling the Sears Tower in the late 1980s. In July 1990, with no potential buyer apparent, Sears took out a mortgage loan on the tower for $850&nbsp;million from [[MetLife]] and [[AEW Capital Management]], with Metlife as the holder of the mortgage note.
