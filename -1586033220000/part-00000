Steel Azin club also had a volleyball team, sponsored by the same Company, which competed in the [[Iranian Volleyball Super League]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Ekbatan football club===\n\n====Re- establishment====\nEkbatan football club had been re-established by two of its former players, Rabti & Ghani, in the late 1990s. Moving up the Iranian Soccer ladder year after year, the team reached the [[Azadegan League]] 1 in 2003. The team was able to avoid relegation for two consecutive years, but lack of financial resources made the club hot favorites for relegation. Following two dismal years, in the summer of 2005, the club was sold by Rabti & Ghani to an Iranian construction tycoon living abroad.\n\n====A New Era====\nFollowing their takeover, the new ownership group of the club announced a new era, vowing to invest in youth. The first move was a shuffle on the bench. Rabti was replaced by his assistant coach, and was made Technical Director. Ghani remained Club manager in the new Club structure modeled after German teams- it included the owner as club chairman. The club's pre- season included a month-long stay in Dubai and matches against Sharjah Wanderers Club, Fabexi FC and [[Al Nasr SC (Dubai)|Al Nasr SC]]. With the new investments, a trip to Dubai and a place to call home ([[Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium]]), Ekbatan was tipped as a possible promotion candidate.\nOnce the season started though, it took only three weeks for the coach to be replaced and Rabti was re- installed as head coach. The club's dismal start to the season continued, which saw them at the bottom of the standings by mid season despite a remarkable 1:0 win over league leaders [[Pegah F.C.]] who suffered their first defeat of the season. The club continued a losing run and Rabti was sacked with 5 games left, though he would remain on the board until the end of the season. Team scout and Ekbatan legend Hadi Ahangaran was given the task of fighting relegation and keeping the club in the league. This proved a successful appointment, and the club narrowly beat the drop after beating [[Nozhan]] in the relegation play off match, played in Esfehan.\nIn preparation for the next season, Ekbatan made some high-profile changes to the backroom staff including [[Farhad Kazemi]] as \"special advisor to the Board\". Former Paykan FC assistant coach under Farhad Kazemi, [[Mohsen Garousi]] was named head coach and Ebrahim Vatanikia, one of the countries most renowned youth coaches, as head of the youth academy. Major changes in the team followed, with only 6 players remaining from the previous season, and this time, the club set their sights on a more modest mid table finish.\nThe club's start to the season though was anything but, as Garousi was fired after losing all of the first seven games. His replacement [[Asghar Sharafi]] signed on a two-year deal and promised to keep the club in the Second division. Despite a five match winning streak, the team was not able to make up for their terrible start to the season, finishing in 9th place- only a four-point improvement from the previous season.\nShortly after, speculation began on the club's future. While the senior team had not enjoyed much success during the past two seasons, the club had proven successful with its ambitious plans for the youth academy. Vatanikia also affirmed the support of the board by praising them in an interview after winning numerous titles with Ekbatan's academy.\n\n===Hedayati takeover===\nOn April 30, 2007 Iranian multi millionaire [[Hossein Hedayati]] bought Ekbatan Football Club and renamed it to Steel Azin Football Club.<ref>[http://www.steelazinfc.com/newscast/data/fullstory/EEZZAlpyyuBCOJrSgn.php]{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> With strong financial support and an ambitious owner, Steel Azin promised to be the new heavyweights in Iranian football.\nAfter taking over, then chairman [[Ali Parvin]] immediately announced the name change, from Ekbatan football Club to Steel Azin Football Club. This was only the first of many changes to come.\n\n===Youth academy===\nEkbatan football club was known for having one of the best youth academies in Iranian football and had introduced a number of talented players to Iranian football. Ekbatan FC was one of the youngest teams in the Azadegan League 1, with an age average of 23 in the season prior to the takeover of [[Hossein Hedayati]]. Following the takeover Steel Azin's youth academy was completely recreated by former [[Iran national football team|Iranian national team]] coach [[Heshmat Mohajerani]].\n\n===Iran Pro League===\n[[File:Steel Azin HQ.jpg|thumb|Steel Azin F.C. Headquarters in Tehran|300px]]\nHossein Hedayati went on an unprecedented shopping spree as he brought the biggest names in Iranian football to his second tier football club of Steel Azin. Players included national team goalkeeper [[Ebrahim Mirzapour]], Davoud Fanaei, [[Hamed Kavianpour]], [[Ali Ansarian]] and [[Mohammad Parvin]]. Iranian football legend Ali Parvin was installed as Technical director while former Esteghlal and Cameroon assistant coach [[Theo De Jong]] became head coach. [[Heshmat Mohajerani]] was named director of the youth academy.\nThe huge media buzz and the stars who were brought in, did not prove successful as they were not able to gain promotion to the Premier League. [[Mohammad Parvin]] finished as top scorer following a number of impressive appearances.\nThe following year, after a major big names load off, the club was narrowly promoted to the Premier League. Following promotion to the top tier, the heavy investments once again commenced. Star signings followed and even foreign based players like Lek Kcira, Leonard Kweuke and Iranians [[Ferydoon Zandi]] and [[Amir Shapourzadeh]]. The player who caused for the biggest media attention though, was [[Ali Karimi]] who joined from rivals Pirouzi. Steel Azins first season in the Iranian Premier League caused for probably the most media frenzy since a long time. The reds finished in fifth place and the blame was put largely on their defence.\nIn the 2010/2011 season, Steel Azin had a nightmare season. With numerous Managerial and coaching changes, the club was bottom of the table for nearly all of the 34 weeks. Ali Karimis contract was terminated and he moved to German giants [[Schalke 04]], [[Ali Parvin]] returned to the club, the controversial fair play saga against their bitter rivals [[Persepolis F.C.]], all didn't help prevent a disastrous fall into the second tier of Iranian football. The season ended after a 6:1 home defeat against [[Shahrdari Tabriz F.C.]] meaning the star-studded Tehran club finished the season in rock bottom, despite reported investments of nearly $40mil. by owner Hossein Hedayati.\nDue to the poor results, major investments, and a star-studded lineup, the nickname of \"FC Hollywood\" was given to the club by the media. This was also due to the fact that players seemed to be enjoying themselves with their large salaries, rather than playing as would be expected of them. The club were often referred to as the \"Galacticos of Iran\" during their first season in the Premier League which was more successful.\nThe controversial refusal to continue playing, following the Tehran derby against Pirouzi, was later withheld and the club agreed to play the last four matches. Steel Azin were relegated two weeks prior to the end of the season.\nFollowing their relegation into the [[Azadegan League]], Steel Azin has moved from Tehran to Semnan. Former [[Zob Ahan F.C.|Zob Ahan]] General Manager has been appointed as the new CEO of the club. The club was relegated from the first division. The following year, Steel Azin finished in 10th place but was later fined by FIFA and docked 12 points which led to their relegation to the third division. Steel Azin currently plays in the third tier of Iranian football.\n\n==Season-by-season==\nThe table below chronicles the achievements of the club in the League and Hazfi Cup since 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=9|League\n!rowspan=2|[[Hazfi Cup]]\n!colspan=2|Leagues Top goalscorer\n!rowspan=2|Manager(s)\n|-\n!Division\n!P\n!W\n!D\n!L\n!F\n!A\n!Pts\n!Pos\n!Name(s)\n!Goals\n|-\n!2005\u201306\n|[[Azadegan League 2005\u201306|Div 1]]\n|22\n|4\n|9\n|9\n|20\n|28\n|21\n|10th\n|align=left|[[2005\u201306 Hazfi Cup|First Round]]\n|align=left|'''Hossein Vaez'''\n|6\n|Mohammad Rabti/ Hadi Ahangaran\n|-\n!2006\u201307\n|[[Azadegan League 2006\u201307|Div 1]]\n|22\n|6\n|7\n|9\n|13\n|24\n|25\n|9th\n|align=left|[[2006\u201307 Hazfi Cup|First Round]]\n|align=left|'''Mohammad Siah'''\n|10\n|[[Mohsen Garousi]]/ [[Asghar Sharafi]]\n|-\n!2007\u201308\n|[[Azadegan League 2007\u201308|Div 1]]\n|22\n|11\n|5\n|6\n|41\n|28\n|38\n|3rd\n|align=left|[[2007\u201308 Hazfi Cup|1/8 Final]]\n|align=left|'''[[Mohammad Parvin]]'''\n|15\n|[[Theo de Jong|de Jong]]/ [[Jan Verheijen]]/ [[Farhad Kazemi|Kazemi]]\n|-\n!2008\u201309\n|[[Azadegan League 2008-09|Div 1]]\n|26\n|17\n|4\n|5\n|49\n|30\n|55\n|bgcolor=99FF66|1st\n|align=left|[[2008\u201309 Hazfi Cup|1/8 Final]]\n|align=left|[[Hadi Khodadadi]]\n|10\n|[[Nader Dastneshan]]\n|-\n!2009\u201310\n|[[Persian Gulf Cup 2009-10|IPL]]\n|34\n|13\n|13\n|8\n|55\n|49\n|52\n|5th\n|align=left|[[2009\u201310 Hazfi Cup|Quarterfinal]]\n|align=left|[[Ali Karimi]]\n|14\n|[[Hamid Reza Estili|Estili]]/ [[Afshin Peyrovani|Peyrovani]]\n|-\n!2010\u201311\n|[[Persian Gulf Cup 2010-11|IPL]]\n|34\n|6\n|10\n|18\n|30\n|63\n|28\n|bgcolor=FFCCCC|18th\n|align=left|[[Hazfi Cup 2010-11|Quarterfinal]]\n|align=left|[[Siavash Akbarpour]]<br>[[Mohammad Gholami]]\n|9\n|[[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107|Tumbakovi\u0107]]/ [[Afshin Peyrovani|Peyrovani]]/ [[Mohammad Khakpour|Khakpour]]/ [[Mahmoud Yavari|Yavari]]\n|-\n!2011\u201312\n|[[2011\u201312 Azadegan League|Div 1]]\n|26\n|10\n|10\n|6\n|29\n|22\n|28\n|bgcolor=FFCCCC|10th\n|align=left|[[2011\u201312 Hazfi Cup|Third Round]]\n|[[Hamid Kazemi]]\n|11\n|[[Human Afazeli|Afazeli]]/ [[Mojtaba Kheirandish|Kheirandish]]\n|-\n|-\n!2012\u201313\n|[[2012\u201313 Iran Football's 2nd Division|Div 2]]\n|26\n|10\n|6\n|10\n|26\n|24\n|36\n|7th\n|align=left|[[2012\u201313 Hazfi Cup|First Round]]\n|[[Farid Behzad]]\n|10\n|[[Mojtaba Kheirandish|Kheirandish]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Key===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n*P = Played\n*W = Games won\n*D = Games drawn\n*L = Games lost\n*F = Goals for\n*A = Goals against\n*Pts = Points\n*Pos = Final position\n{{col-4}}\n*IPL = [[Iran Pro League]]\n*Div 1 = [[Azadegan League]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=gold|<small>Champions</small>\n|bgcolor=silver|<small>Runners-up</small>\n|bgcolor=99FF66|<small>Promoted</small>\n|bgcolor=FFCCCC|<small>Relegated</small>\n|}\n\n==Sponsorship==\n\n===Official sponsor===\nThe official club sponsor is Steel Azin Co, which is also owned by [[Hossein Hedayati]].

The club were often referred to as the \"Galacticos of Iran\" during their first season in the Premier League which was more successful.\nThe controversial refusal to continue playing, following the Tehran derby against Pirouzi, was later withheld and the club agreed to play the last four matches. Steel Azin were relegated two weeks prior to the end of the season.\nFollowing their relegation into the [[Azadegan League]], Steel Azin has moved from Tehran to Semnan. Former [[Zob Ahan F.C.|Zob Ahan]] General Manager has been appointed as the new CEO of the club. The club was relegated from the first division. The following year, Steel Azin finished in 10th place but was later fined by FIFA and docked 12 points which led to their relegation to the third division. Steel Azin currently plays in the third tier of Iranian football.\n\n==Season-by-season==\nThe table below chronicles the achievements of the club in the League and Hazfi Cup since 2005.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=9|League\n!rowspan=2|[[Hazfi Cup]]\n!colspan=2|Leagues Top goalscorer\n!rowspan=2|Manager(s)\n|-\n!Division\n!P\n!W\n!D\n!L\n!F\n!A\n!Pts\n!Pos\n!Name(s)\n!Goals\n|-\n!2005\u201306\n|[[Azadegan League 2005\u201306|Div 1]]\n|22\n|4\n|9\n|9\n|20\n|28\n|21\n|10th\n|align=left|[[2005\u201306 Hazfi Cup|First Round]]\n|align=left|'''Hossein Vaez'''\n|6\n|Mohammad Rabti/ Hadi Ahangaran\n|-\n!2006\u201307\n|[[Azadegan League 2006\u201307|Div 1]]\n|22\n|6\n|7\n|9\n|13\n|24\n|25\n|9th\n|align=left|[[2006\u201307 Hazfi Cup|First Round]]\n|align=left|'''Mohammad Siah'''\n|10\n|[[Mohsen Garousi]]/ [[Asghar Sharafi]]\n|-\n!2007\u201308\n|[[Azadegan League 2007\u201308|Div 1]]\n|22\n|11\n|5\n|6\n|41\n|28\n|38\n|3rd\n|align=left|[[2007\u201308 Hazfi Cup|1/8 Final]]\n|align=left|'''[[Mohammad Parvin]]'''\n|15\n|[[Theo de Jong|de Jong]]/ [[Jan Verheijen]]/ [[Farhad Kazemi|Kazemi]]\n|-\n!2008\u201309\n|[[Azadegan League 2008-09|Div 1]]\n|26\n|17\n|4\n|5\n|49\n|30\n|55\n|bgcolor=99FF66|1st\n|align=left|[[2008\u201309 Hazfi Cup|1/8 Final]]\n|align=left|[[Hadi Khodadadi]]\n|10\n|[[Nader Dastneshan]]\n|-\n!2009\u201310\n|[[Persian Gulf Cup 2009-10|IPL]]\n|34\n|13\n|13\n|8\n|55\n|49\n|52\n|5th\n|align=left|[[2009\u201310 Hazfi Cup|Quarterfinal]]\n|align=left|[[Ali Karimi]]\n|14\n|[[Hamid Reza Estili|Estili]]/ [[Afshin Peyrovani|Peyrovani]]\n|-\n!2010\u201311\n|[[Persian Gulf Cup 2010-11|IPL]]\n|34\n|6\n|10\n|18\n|30\n|63\n|28\n|bgcolor=FFCCCC|18th\n|align=left|[[Hazfi Cup 2010-11|Quarterfinal]]\n|align=left|[[Siavash Akbarpour]]<br>[[Mohammad Gholami]]\n|9\n|[[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107|Tumbakovi\u0107]]/ [[Afshin Peyrovani|Peyrovani]]/ [[Mohammad Khakpour|Khakpour]]/ [[Mahmoud Yavari|Yavari]]\n|-\n!2011\u201312\n|[[2011\u201312 Azadegan League|Div 1]]\n|26\n|10\n|10\n|6\n|29\n|22\n|28\n|bgcolor=FFCCCC|10th\n|align=left|[[2011\u201312 Hazfi Cup|Third Round]]\n|[[Hamid Kazemi]]\n|11\n|[[Human Afazeli|Afazeli]]/ [[Mojtaba Kheirandish|Kheirandish]]\n|-\n|-\n!2012\u201313\n|[[2012\u201313 Iran Football's 2nd Division|Div 2]]\n|26\n|10\n|6\n|10\n|26\n|24\n|36\n|7th\n|align=left|[[2012\u201313 Hazfi Cup|First Round]]\n|[[Farid Behzad]]\n|10\n|[[Mojtaba Kheirandish|Kheirandish]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Key===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n*P = Played\n*W = Games won\n*D = Games drawn\n*L = Games lost\n*F = Goals for\n*A = Goals against\n*Pts = Points\n*Pos = Final position\n{{col-4}}\n*IPL = [[Iran Pro League]]\n*Div 1 = [[Azadegan League]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=gold|<small>Champions</small>\n|bgcolor=silver|<small>Runners-up</small>\n|bgcolor=99FF66|<small>Promoted</small>\n|bgcolor=FFCCCC|<small>Relegated</small>\n|}\n\n==Sponsorship==\n\n===Official sponsor===\nThe official club sponsor is Steel Azin Co, which is also owned by [[Hossein Hedayati]].

Its governed municipality covers an area of {{convert|470|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==History==\nThe town was first mentioned in 1280 under the Latin name ''Castrum Novum'' which, literally translated, means 'new fort'. It belonged to the dukes of Blagaj and in the early sixteenth century came under power of [[Nikola Zrinski]]. Croatian ban Adam Ba\u010dan conquered Novi in 1693.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106\nSTARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf\n#page=36 </ref> [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] on his journey through Bosnia mentions that Croatian nobles built Novi Grad.  <ref>Hazim \u0160abanovi\u0107, Putopis : odlomci o jugoslavenskim zemljama, 1967,\nhttps://www.academia.edu/6486045/Evlija_Celebi_Putopis #page=219</ref>  In 1895, during [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the town was officially given the name 'Bosanski Novi'. At the same time, the city included around 3,300 people with 550 households. Wooden bridges existed across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sana river|Sana]] rivers which the citizens had to guard against floods in the autumn and spring. For that reason, a current-day symbol of the town was built in 1906\u2014the Una quay. \n\nIn 1872, Novi Grad was the first municipality to have a train station on the new Bosnian railway, which afforded it significant cultural and economic advantages over other [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]]<ref name=\"fg\">[http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= Krajina, official name of region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607112746/http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= |date=2015-06-07 }}</ref>  municipalities. The first hospital was established around the same time.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Novi Grad was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFrom 1992 through 1995, the town was ethnically cleansed of its Bosniak and Croat inhabitants, thereby rendering it almost completely Serb-populated. In order to distance the town from its Bosnian history and its cultural roots and in tune with the war politics, the local Serb government renamed the town to Novi Grad, a change criticized by Croat and Bosniak residents. Consequently, majority of people from Bosanski Novi were misplaced and live all over Europe, the American continent, Australia and elsewhere around the globe. \n\nAfter the Bosnian war, [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]] was split from the municipality.\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Novi Grad, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ahmetovci]]\n* [[Blagaj Japra]]\n* [[Blagaj Rijeka]]\n* [[Blatna]]\n* [[Buljuk]]\n* [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]]\n* [[Cerovica (Novi Grad)|Cerovica]]\n* [[Crni Timok|Crna Rijeka]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Donja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Donja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja]]\n* [[\u0106ele]]\n* [[Devetaci (Novi Grad)|Devetaci]]\n* [[Dobrljin]]\n* [[Donje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Donji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Donji Rakani]]\n* [[Gornja Slabinja]]\n* [[Gornje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Gornji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornji Rakani]]\n* [[Graba\u0161nica]]\n* [[Grdanovac]]\n* [[Gumnjani]]\n* [[Hozi\u0107i (Novi Grad)|Hozi\u0107i]]\n* [[Johovica (Novi Grad)|Johovica]]\n* [[Jo\u0161ava]]\n* [[Kalenderi]]\n* [[Kr\u0161lje]]\n* [[Kuljani (Novi Grad)|Kuljani]]\n* [[Lje\u0161ljani]]\n* [[Mala Krupska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala Novska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Maslovare (Novi Grad)|Maslovare]]\n* [[Matavazi]]\n* [[Mazi\u0107]]\n* [[Mrakodol]]\n* [[Mraovo Polje]]\n* [[Petkovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petkovac]]\n* [[Petrinja, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petrinja]]\n* [[Pobr\u0111ani (Novi Grad)|Pobr\u0111ani]]\n* [[Podo\u0161ka]]\n* [[Poljavnice]]\n* [[Prusci]]\n* [[Radomirovac]]\n* [[Rakovac (Novi Grad)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Ra\u0161\u0107e]]\n* [[Ravnice, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ravnice]]\n* [[Rudice]]\n* [[Sokoli\u0161te]]\n* [[Suha\u010da (Novi Grad)|Suha\u010da]]\n* [[Svodna]]\n* [[Tavija]]\n* [[Trgovi\u0161te, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Trgovi\u0161te]]\n* [[Vedovica]]\n* [[Velika Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Velika \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Vitasavci]]\n* [[Zovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zovik]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Autumn in Novi Grad.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Autumn in Novi Grad]]\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

municipality in [[Republika Srpska]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Situated in the far northwest of the country, it lies across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] from the [[Croatia]]n town of [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]]. {{As of|2013||alt=According to the 2013 census|df=}}, the town has a population of 11,063 while its municipality comprises a total of 27,115 inhabitants. \n\nKnown for its scenic quay, Novi Grad lies at the confluence of the Una and [[Sana (river)|Sana]] rivers. \n\n==Geography==\nNovi Grad is located on the right bank of the Una and both banks of the Sana, between two geographic zones: the slopes of the mountains of Grme\u010d and Kozara, and the alluvial land surrounding the town's two rivers. The town itself is located {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=in}} above sea level, at nearly 45\u00b0N; the climate is temperate-continental. Its governed municipality covers an area of {{convert|470|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==History==\nThe town was first mentioned in 1280 under the Latin name ''Castrum Novum'' which, literally translated, means 'new fort'. It belonged to the dukes of Blagaj and in the early sixteenth century came under power of [[Nikola Zrinski]]. Croatian ban Adam Ba\u010dan conquered Novi in 1693.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106\nSTARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf\n#page=36 </ref> [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] on his journey through Bosnia mentions that Croatian nobles built Novi Grad.  <ref>Hazim \u0160abanovi\u0107, Putopis : odlomci o jugoslavenskim zemljama, 1967,\nhttps://www.academia.edu/6486045/Evlija_Celebi_Putopis #page=219</ref>  In 1895, during [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the town was officially given the name 'Bosanski Novi'. At the same time, the city included around 3,300 people with 550 households. Wooden bridges existed across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sana river|Sana]] rivers which the citizens had to guard against floods in the autumn and spring. For that reason, a current-day symbol of the town was built in 1906\u2014the Una quay. \n\nIn 1872, Novi Grad was the first municipality to have a train station on the new Bosnian railway, which afforded it significant cultural and economic advantages over other [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]]<ref name=\"fg\">[http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= Krajina, official name of region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607112746/http://www.turizamrs.org/pocetna.php?menu_id=&cid=&page=225&gastro_id=&podneblje= |date=2015-06-07 }}</ref>  municipalities. The first hospital was established around the same time.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Novi Grad was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFrom 1992 through 1995, the town was ethnically cleansed of its Bosniak and Croat inhabitants, thereby rendering it almost completely Serb-populated. In order to distance the town from its Bosnian history and its cultural roots and in tune with the war politics, the local Serb government renamed the town to Novi Grad, a change criticized by Croat and Bosniak residents. Consequently, majority of people from Bosanski Novi were misplaced and live all over Europe, the American continent, Australia and elsewhere around the globe. \n\nAfter the Bosnian war, [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]] was split from the municipality.\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Novi Grad, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ahmetovci]]\n* [[Blagaj Japra]]\n* [[Blagaj Rijeka]]\n* [[Blatna]]\n* [[Buljuk]]\n* [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kostajnica]]\n* [[Cerovica (Novi Grad)|Cerovica]]\n* [[Crni Timok|Crna Rijeka]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Donja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Donja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Gornja]]\n* [[\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja (Novi Grad)|\u010ca\u0111avica Srednja]]\n* [[\u0106ele]]\n* [[Devetaci (Novi Grad)|Devetaci]]\n* [[Dobrljin]]\n* [[Donje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Donji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Donji Rakani]]\n* [[Gornja Slabinja]]\n* [[Gornje Vodi\u010devo]]\n* [[Gornji Agi\u0107i]]\n* [[Gornji Rakani]]\n* [[Graba\u0161nica]]\n* [[Grdanovac]]\n* [[Gumnjani]]\n* [[Hozi\u0107i (Novi Grad)|Hozi\u0107i]]\n* [[Johovica (Novi Grad)|Johovica]]\n* [[Jo\u0161ava]]\n* [[Kalenderi]]\n* [[Kr\u0161lje]]\n* [[Kuljani (Novi Grad)|Kuljani]]\n* [[Lje\u0161ljani]]\n* [[Mala Krupska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala Novska Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Mala \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Maslovare (Novi Grad)|Maslovare]]\n* [[Matavazi]]\n* [[Mazi\u0107]]\n* [[Mrakodol]]\n* [[Mraovo Polje]]\n* [[Petkovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petkovac]]\n* [[Petrinja, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petrinja]]\n* [[Pobr\u0111ani (Novi Grad)|Pobr\u0111ani]]\n* [[Podo\u0161ka]]\n* [[Poljavnice]]\n* [[Prusci]]\n* [[Radomirovac]]\n* [[Rakovac (Novi Grad)|Rakovac]]\n* [[Ra\u0161\u0107e]]\n* [[Ravnice, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ravnice]]\n* [[Rudice]]\n* [[Sokoli\u0161te]]\n* [[Suha\u010da (Novi Grad)|Suha\u010da]]\n* [[Svodna]]\n* [[Tavija]]\n* [[Trgovi\u0161te, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Trgovi\u0161te]]\n* [[Vedovica]]\n* [[Velika Ruji\u0161ka]]\n* [[Velika \u017duljevica]]\n* [[Vitasavci]]\n* [[Zovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zovik]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
