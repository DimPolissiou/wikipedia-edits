From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (''[[Batin (Islam)|B\u0101tin\u012b]]'') and the external (''[[Zahir (Islam)|z\u0101hir\u012b]]''), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[esoterism]] which emerged under the intense influence of [[Batiniyyah|B\u0101tin\u012b]]-[[Sufism]] during the last two centuries.\n\nAmong other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (''mazhariyyat'') and the belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the [[Kal\u00e2m-e Saranj\u00e2m]], otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan \u2013 anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.\n\nThe Yarsani faith's features include [[millenarism]], [[Innatism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[metempsychosis]], [[angelology]], divine manifestation and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Many of these features are found in [[Yazidism]], and they also have many things in common with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and [[Christianity|Christians]]. Unlike other indigenous Persian faiths, Yarsanism explicitly rejects class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the [[Yezidis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"Hamzeh'ee\">{{Cite book |last=Hamzeh'ee |first=M Reza |publication-date=1990 |year=1990 |title=The Yaresan: A Sociological, Historical, and Religio-historical Study of a Kurdish Community |edition= |series=[[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] |volume=138 |publication-place=Berlin |publisher=Schwartz |isbn=3-922968-83-X}}</ref>\n\n===Epochs of Evolution===\nAccording to Yarsani philosophy, the universe is evolving in through different Epochs{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} and that these Epochs are:\n#First Epoch, or ''Shari'at,'' which includes the period from [[Adam and Eve]] until [[Muhammad]], also known as the \"Prophet\" period.\n#Second Epoch, or ''Tariqat,'' which includes the period from [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] until [[Shah Khoshin]], also known as the \"Doctrine\" period.\n#Third Epoch, or ''Marefat'', which includes the period from Shah Khoshin until [[Sultan Sahak]], also known as the \"Mystical\" period.\n#Fourth Epoch, or ''Haqiqat'', which includes the period from [[Sultan Sahak]] until today, also known as the \"Truth\" period.\n\n===Divine manifestations===\nThe Yarsani are [[Emanationism|emanation]]ists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive [[incarnation]]s known as ''mazhariyyats'' (similar to the [[Hindu]] [[avatar]]s). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each  epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as \"''Haft tan''\" which means \"The Seven Persons\"\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Second Epoch was [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[Caliph]] and first imam of [[Shia Islam]]. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis '''Ali-Allahi''', 'Believers in the divinity of Ali'.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the primary ''mazhariyyat'' is held to be [[Sultan Sahak]]. It is said that he was given birth by Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin, and as in the case of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], it was a virginal conception. While sleeping under a [[pomegranate]] tree a kernel of fruit fell into her mouth when a bird pecked the fruit directly over her.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Kurds: History and Culture |url=http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf |page=23 |author=Nebez, Jamal |publisher=Western Kurdistan Association |date=1997-09-19 |accessdate=2006-09-01 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525152728/http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2006-05-25 |authorlink=Jamal Nebez}}</ref>\n\n[[File:kakkai.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kurdish Yarsani men in [[Suleimaniyah]], [[Kurdistan Region]].

The Khandans were established when, along with the ''Haft Tan'', Sultan Sahak also formed the ''Haft Tawane'', a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu'l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the ''Haft Tawane'' was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak's time another four  khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahle-haqq.com/rituals.html|title=Ahl-e Haqq \u2013 Rituals and Traditions|website=www.ahle-haqq.com}}</ref>\n\nEvery Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience.  The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original  founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual 'parents', it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe majority of Yarsanis are found in the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, especially in [[Hawraman]] and the [[Kermanshah province]] of Iran.\n\n===In Iran===\n{{main|Goran Kurds|Kurdish people}}\nThe Yarsani in Iran are mostly found in [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Kermanshah province]]s<ref name=\"auto\"/> There are also large communities of Yarsanis in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]].

The English translation reads:\n\n{{quote|First of all, we must clear up the confusion resulting from the variety of names given to the sect of \"Ahl\u00e9-Haqq\", which are liable to be misunderstood. Like any religion, the one we are dealing with considers itself to be the only true and orthodox one, and it is natural that its adherents give themselves the name of \"People of Truth\" (''Ahl\u00e9-Haqq'' or ''Ahl\u00e9-Haq\u00eeqat''). This term lacks precision, as other sects, for example the [[Hurufism|Horoufis]], occasionally apply it to themselves. Still, the name Ahl\u00e9-Haqq to refer to the sect of our particular interest has every advantage over appellations such as \"[[Ghulat|Gholat]]\", \"[[Ali-Illahism|Al\u00ee-All\u00e2hi]]\", and \"[[Alawites|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" that the Muslims and most European travellers use in speaking of them. The first term, which encompasses all of the extremist Shi\u2019ites, is too broad and too vague. The second term, \"deifiers of Ali\", has the same fault and emphasizes what is only a detail in the religious system under discussion. Finally, the name \"[[Nusairi|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" belongs to that well-defined Syrian religion, which, despite some resemblances with the doctrines of the Ahl\u00e9-Haqq (the worship of Ali, the communion, etc.), appears to present a complex of quite different old beliefs.}}\n\n===Relations with Islam===\n''Ahl-e Haqq'' view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in [[Ali]], and established the stage of [[Sharia|''shai'at'']] (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of [[Tariqa|''tariqat'']] (Sufi teachings), then ''[[ma'rifa]]t'' (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of [[haqiqa]]t (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in [[Sultan Sahak]]. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari'a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi'ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism).

From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (''[[Batin (Islam)|B\u0101tin\u012b]]'') and the external (''[[Zahir (Islam)|z\u0101hir\u012b]]''), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[esoterism]] which emerged under the intense influence of [[Batiniyyah|B\u0101tin\u012b]]-[[Sufism]] during the last two centuries.\n\nAmong other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (''mazhariyyat'') and the belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the [[Kal\u00e2m-e Saranj\u00e2m]], otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan \u2013 anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.\n\nThe Yarsani faith's features include [[millenarism]], [[Innatism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[metempsychosis]], [[angelology]], divine manifestation and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Many of these features are found in [[Yazidism]], and they also have many things in common with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and [[Christianity|Christians]]. Unlike other indigenous Persian faiths, Yarsanism explicitly rejects class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the [[Yezidis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"Hamzeh'ee\">{{Cite book |last=Hamzeh'ee |first=M Reza |publication-date=1990 |year=1990 |title=The Yaresan: A Sociological, Historical, and Religio-historical Study of a Kurdish Community |edition= |series=[[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] |volume=138 |publication-place=Berlin |publisher=Schwartz |isbn=3-922968-83-X}}</ref>\n\n===Epochs of Evolution===\nAccording to Yarsani philosophy, the universe is evolving in through different Epochs{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} and that these Epochs are:\n#First Epoch, or ''Shari'at,'' which includes the period from [[Adam and Eve]] until [[Muhammad]], also known as the \"Prophet\" period.\n#Second Epoch, or ''Tariqat,'' which includes the period from [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] until [[Shah Khoshin]], also known as the \"Doctrine\" period.\n#Third Epoch, or ''Marefat'', which includes the period from Shah Khoshin until [[Sultan Sahak]], also known as the \"Mystical\" period.\n#Fourth Epoch, or ''Haqiqat'', which includes the period from [[Sultan Sahak]] until today, also known as the \"Truth\" period.\n\n===Divine manifestations===\nThe Yarsani are [[Emanationism|emanation]]ists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive [[incarnation]]s known as ''mazhariyyats'' (similar to the [[Hindu]] [[avatar]]s). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each  epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as \"''Haft tan''\" which means \"The Seven Persons\"\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Second Epoch was [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[Caliph]] and first imam of [[Shia Islam]]. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis '''Ali-Allahi''', 'Believers in the divinity of Ali'.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the primary ''mazhariyyat'' is held to be [[Sultan Sahak]]. It is said that he was given birth by Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin, and as in the case of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], it was a virginal conception.

The Khandans were established when, along with the ''Haft Tan'', Sultan Sahak also formed the ''Haft Tawane'', a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu'l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the ''Haft Tawane'' was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak's time another four  khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahle-haqq.com/rituals.html|title=Ahl-e Haqq \u2013 Rituals and Traditions|website=www.ahle-haqq.com}}</ref>\n\nEvery Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience.  The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original  founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual 'parents', it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe majority of Yarsanis are found in the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, especially in [[Hawraman]] and the [[Kermanshah province]] of Iran.\n\n===In Iran===\n{{main|Goran Kurds|Kurdish people}}\nThe Yarsani in Iran are mostly found in [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Kermanshah province]]s<ref name=\"auto\"/> There are also large communities of Yarsanis in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]].

The English translation reads:\n\n{{quote|First of all, we must clear up the confusion resulting from the variety of names given to the sect of \"Ahl\u00e9-Haqq\", which are liable to be misunderstood. Like any religion, the one we are dealing with considers itself to be the only true and orthodox one, and it is natural that its adherents give themselves the name of \"People of Truth\" (''Ahl\u00e9-Haqq'' or ''Ahl\u00e9-Haq\u00eeqat''). This term lacks precision, as other sects, for example the [[Hurufism|Horoufis]], occasionally apply it to themselves. Still, the name Ahl\u00e9-Haqq to refer to the sect of our particular interest has every advantage over appellations such as \"[[Ghulat|Gholat]]\", \"[[Ali-Illahism|Al\u00ee-All\u00e2hi]]\", and \"[[Alawites|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" that the Muslims and most European travellers use in speaking of them. The first term, which encompasses all of the extremist Shi\u2019ites, is too broad and too vague. The second term, \"deifiers of Ali\", has the same fault and emphasizes what is only a detail in the religious system under discussion. Finally, the name \"[[Nusairi|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" belongs to that well-defined Syrian religion, which, despite some resemblances with the doctrines of the Ahl\u00e9-Haqq (the worship of Ali, the communion, etc.), appears to present a complex of quite different old beliefs.}}\n\n===Relations with Islam===\n''Ahl-e Haqq'' view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in [[Ali]], and established the stage of [[Sharia|''shai'at'']] (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of [[Tariqa|''tariqat'']] (Sufi teachings), then ''[[ma'rifa]]t'' (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of [[haqiqa]]t (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in [[Sultan Sahak]]. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari'a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi'ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism). The Ahl-i Haqq neither observe Muslim rites, such as daily prayers and fasting during the month of Ramadan, nor share Islamic theology and sacred space, such as belief in the day of resurrection and sanctity of the mosque.<ref>Z.

These militants have prosecuted Yarsanis during the [[Iraq conflict (2003\u2013present)|Iraq conflict]], possibly prompting some Iraqi Yarsan community leaders to declare in 2013 that their people were actually Muslims to avoid sectarian attacks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-terror-group-surges-iraq-disputed-territories/4455890.html |title=IS Terror Group Surges in Iraq's Disputed Territories |author=Rikar Hussein |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=4 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-islamic-state-kakai-minority/4455712.html |title=IS Attacks Drive Members of Iraqi Kakai Minority From Their Villages |author=Dilshad Anwar |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ali-Illahism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Yarsanism}}\n* [http://www.shaikhsiddiqui.com/aliilahi.html Ali-Ilahis]\n* [http://www.ahle-haqq.com/ Ahl-e Haqq] \u2013 \"An Oriental Order of Mysticism\".\n* [http://www.ostadelahi.com Ostad Elahi] (Nur Ali Elahi) \u2013 official website.\n* [http://www.razbar.com Razbar Ensemble] \u2013 sacred music of Ahl-e Haqq.\n* [http://www.shaikhsiddiqui.com/aliilahi.html Ali-Ilahi and Ahl-e-Haq]\n* [http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/02/iraq-kakai-religious-minority-kurdistan-quota.html Who are Iraq's Kakai? \u2013 Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East]\n* [http://www.pdk-iran.org/english/doc/unhrc_iran_2002_minorities.htm Status of Minorities in Iran] \u2013 excerpted from [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/40fc68cd8a9a97f9c1256b8100525f97/$FILE/G0210126.pdf Report on Iran], 16 January 2002, by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UNCHR]].\n* [http://home.hum.uva.nl/oz/leezenberg/GInflCK.pdf Gorani Influence on Central Kurdish: Substratum or Prestige Borrowing?] Leezenberg, Michiel: ILLC \u2013 Department of [[Philosophy]], [[University of Amsterdam]]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=TUhwyBmBnI4C&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=edmonds+1957&source=web&ots=ARVgucLpDw&sig=_hUZ-gsWKTwFj3TIDxsOW7WpXrs#PPA157,M1 The Shabak and the Kakais in Northern Iraq], Syncretistic religious communities in the Near East: collected papers of the International Symposium \"Alevism in Turkey and comparable sycretistic religious communities in the Near East in the past and present\" Berlin, 14\u201317 April 1995, Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi, Barbara Kellner-Heinkele, Anke Otter-Beaujean, Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi, Barbara.\n* [http://www.kurdishacademy.org/english/articles/articles-007.html Leezenberg, Michiel: ILLC \u2013 Department of Humanities], [[University of Amsterdam]]\n\n{{religion topics|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yarsanism}}\n[[Category:Yarsanism| ]]\n[[Category:Iranian religions]]\n[[Category:Kurdish culture]]\n[[Category:Monotheistic religions]]\n[[Category:Mysticism]]\n[[Category:Religion in Iran]]\n[[Category:Religion in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Religion in Kurdistan]]\n", "name_user": "Sems\u00fbr\u00ee", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed unsourced sentence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarsanism"}
