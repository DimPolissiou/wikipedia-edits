constitutional conference between 1994 to 1995. Early in 1998, Abacha announced that elections would be held on 1 August, with a view toward handing power to a civilian government on 1 October. It later became apparent that Abacha had no intention of relinquishing power. By April 1998, Abacha had coerced the country's five political parties into endorsing him as the sole presidential candidate.\n\n=== Human rights ===\nAbacha's regime was accused of [[human rights]] abuses, especially after the hanging of [[Ogoni]] activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] (only one of several executions of Ogoni activists opposed to the exploitation of [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|Nigerian resources]] by the [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[petroleum]] company, [[Royal Dutch Shell]]).<ref name=\"Arnold7892222\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/africamodernhist00arno|title=Africa: A Modern History|last1=Arnold|first1=Guy|date=2005|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=9781843541769|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/africamodernhist00arno/page/789 789]|url-access=registration}}</ref> [[Wole Soyinka]] was charged in absentia with treason.<ref name=\"eb222\"/> Abacha's regime suffered opposition externally by pro-democracy activists.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nFollowing the execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Nigeria was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"NYT-Commonwealth22\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/world/commonwealth-suspends-nigeria-over-executions.html|title=Commonwealth Suspends Nigeria Over Executions|website=New York Times|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Falola-Heaton22\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XygZjbNRap0C&pg=PR19&lpg=PR19&dq=nigeria+as+a+pariah+state+abacha&source=bl&ots=ETDHqMf0QM&sig=4DJTvfSgBx78AW0lsWzeFXv0CJc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAWoVChMIiuLBhai_xwIVScyACh34Sw0f#v=onepage&q=nigeria%20as%20a%20pariah%20state%20abacha&f=false|title=A History of Nigeria|last1=Falola & Heaton|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2008|isbn=9781139472036|page=xix|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref> While hosting [[Nelson Mandela]], Abacha admitted he was advised against interfering with the Saro-Wiwa's trial\u2014but made assurances that he would use his rank in government to commute the sentence if death sentence was pronounced. [[Justice Ibrahim auta|Justice Ibrahim Auta]] was the judge presiding over the proceedings, and sentenced Saro-Wiwa to [[Hanging|death by hanging]]. Abacha did not commute the sentence.\n\nDirectly infringing UN Sanctions on Libya, [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s West African Tour in 1997 to Sani Abacha to mark the new islamic year was greeted by thousands of Abacha's supporters whom came out to demonstrate their loyalty to Abacha and the Libyan leader in [[Kano]].<ref>{{Citation|last=AP Archive|title=Nigeria - Gaddafi arrives to celebrate holiday|date=2015-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuthDUJZAQc|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> The Libyan leader made no commitments to Nigeria but merely sought to strengthen relations with the country, many saw the visit as a way to strengthen his agenda of [[Pan-Africanism]].\n\nAbacha intervened in the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]]. Through the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group]], Abacha sent troops to Liberia to fight against the rising insurgency in the country and political tensions. The Civil War, which began in 1989, saw an influx of Nigerian troops from 1990 when Abacha was defence minister.\n\nDespite being repeatedly condemned by the [[US State Department]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/11/09/braun|title=Return of the ugly American|work=salon.com}}</ref> Abacha did have a few ties to American politics. In 1997, Senator [[James Inhofe]] ([[US Republican Party|R]]-[[Oklahoma]]) travelled to Nigeria to meet with Abacha as a representative of the \"[[The Family (Christian political organization)|Family]]\", a group of [[Christian evangelism|evangelical Christian]] politicians and civic leaders. Abacha and the Family had a business and political relationship from that point until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/11/doug-coe-inhofe-siljander-c-street|title=Junkets for Jesus|work=Mother Jones}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=121755993|title=A Different Perspective On 'The Family' And Uganda|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}</ref>  Abacha also developed ties with other American political figures such as Senator [[Carol Moseley Braun]], Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] and Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]]. Several African American political leaders visited Nigeria during his reign and Farrakhan supported his administration.\n\n==Death==\nOn 8 June 1998, Abacha died in the [[Aso Rock Presidential Villa]] in [[Abuja]]. He was buried on the same day, according to [[Muslim]] tradition, without an [[autopsy]].

constitutional conference between 1994 to 1995. Early in 1998, Abacha announced that elections would be held on 1 August, with a view toward handing power to a civilian government on 1 October. It later became apparent that Abacha had no intention of relinquishing power. By April 1998, Abacha had coerced the country's five political parties into endorsing him as the sole presidential candidate.\n\n=== Human rights ===\nAbacha's regime was accused of [[human rights]] abuses, especially after the hanging of [[Ogoni]] activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] (only one of several executions of Ogoni activists opposed to the exploitation of [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|Nigerian resources]] by the [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[petroleum]] company, [[Royal Dutch Shell]]).<ref name=\"Arnold7892222\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/africamodernhist00arno|title=Africa: A Modern History|last1=Arnold|first1=Guy|date=2005|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=9781843541769|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/africamodernhist00arno/page/789 789]|url-access=registration}}</ref> [[Wole Soyinka]] was charged in absentia with treason.<ref name=\"eb222\"/> Abacha's regime suffered opposition externally by pro-democracy activists.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nFollowing the execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Nigeria was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"NYT-Commonwealth22\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/world/commonwealth-suspends-nigeria-over-executions.html|title=Commonwealth Suspends Nigeria Over Executions|website=New York Times|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Falola-Heaton22\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XygZjbNRap0C&pg=PR19&lpg=PR19&dq=nigeria+as+a+pariah+state+abacha&source=bl&ots=ETDHqMf0QM&sig=4DJTvfSgBx78AW0lsWzeFXv0CJc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAWoVChMIiuLBhai_xwIVScyACh34Sw0f#v=onepage&q=nigeria%20as%20a%20pariah%20state%20abacha&f=false|title=A History of Nigeria|last1=Falola & Heaton|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2008|isbn=9781139472036|page=xix|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref> While hosting [[Nelson Mandela]], Abacha admitted he was advised against interfering with the Saro-Wiwa's trial\u2014but made assurances that he would use his rank in government to commute the sentence if death sentence was pronounced. [[Justice Ibrahim auta|Justice Ibrahim Auta]] was the judge presiding over the proceedings, and sentenced Saro-Wiwa to [[Hanging|death by hanging]]. Abacha did not commute the sentence.\n\nDirectly infringing UN Sanctions on Libya, [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s West African Tour in 1997 to Sani Abacha to mark the new islamic year was greeted by thousands of Abacha's supporters whom came out to demonstrate their loyalty to Abacha and the Libyan leader in [[Kano]].<ref>{{Citation|last=AP Archive|title=Nigeria - Gaddafi arrives to celebrate holiday|date=2015-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuthDUJZAQc|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> The Libyan leader made no commitments to Nigeria but merely sought to strengthen relations with the country, many saw the visit as a way to strengthen his agenda of [[Pan-Africanism]].\n\nAbacha intervened in the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]]. Through the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group]], Abacha sent troops to Liberia to fight against the rising insurgency in the country and political tensions. The Civil War, which began in 1989, saw an influx of Nigerian troops from 1990 when Abacha was defence minister.\n\nDespite being repeatedly condemned by the [[US State Department]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/11/09/braun|title=Return of the ugly American|work=salon.com}}</ref> Abacha did have a few ties to American politics. In 1997, Senator [[James Inhofe]] ([[US Republican Party|R]]-[[Oklahoma]]) travelled to Nigeria to meet with Abacha as a representative of the \"[[The Family (Christian political organization)|Family]]\", a group of [[Christian evangelism|evangelical Christian]] politicians and civic leaders. Abacha and the Family had a business and political relationship from that point until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/11/doug-coe-inhofe-siljander-c-street|title=Junkets for Jesus|work=Mother Jones}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=121755993|title=A Different Perspective On 'The Family' And Uganda|date=22 December 2009|work=NPR.org}}</ref>  Abacha also developed ties with other American political figures such as Senator [[Carol Moseley Braun]], Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] and Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]]. Several African American political leaders visited Nigeria during his reign and Farrakhan supported his administration.\n\n==Death==\nOn 8 June 1998, Abacha died in the [[Aso Rock Presidential Villa]] in [[Abuja]]. He was buried on the same day, according to [[Muslim]] tradition, without an [[autopsy]].

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first [[algorithm]] intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \"[[computing machine]]\" and one of the first computer [[programmer]]s.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Ana Lena|date=November\u2013December 2011|title=Crowdsourcing Gender Equity: Ada Lovelace Day, and its companion website, aims to raise the profile of women in science and technology|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/crowdsourcing-gender-equity|journal=American Scientist|volume=99|issue=6|page=463}}</ref><ref name=\"Lovelace Google\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|date=10 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAugusta Byron was the only legitimate child of poet [[Lord Byron]] and his wife [[Lady Byron]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323|title=Ada Lovelace Biography|website=biography.com}}</ref> All of [[Lord Byron#Children|Byron's other children]] were born out of wedlock to other women.<ref name= ABCL/> Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later.

Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived [[insanity]]. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]].\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''.

She did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old.

She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation.

At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\n\n{{Quote|text=When Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the [[anatomy of birds]] to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, ''Flyology,'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>}}\n\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]]]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was [[debutante|presented at Court]] at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835, she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]], becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|title=Hon.

This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=340\u201342}} She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards.

She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King (physician)|William King]],<ref name=williamkings group=lower-alpha>William King, her tutor, and William King, her future husband, were not related.</ref> and [[Mary Somerville]], the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in ''one'' shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar{{Sfn|Toole|1998|p=99}}</blockquote>\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts.

Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=370}} She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=369}} She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\n\n==Work==\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including [[phrenology]]{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=198}} and [[mesmerism]].{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=232\u201333}} After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=305}} She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=310\u201314}} In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron [[Karl von Reichenbach]], ''Researches on Magnetism'', but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=315\u201317}} In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=335}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ada by British painter [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]] (1836)]]\nLovelace first met [[Charles Babbage]] in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his [[difference engine]].{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=36\u201338}} She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could.

With the article, she appended a set of notes.{{Sfn|Menabrea|1843}} Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=265}} Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=267}} Her work was well received at the time; the scientist [[Michael Faraday]] described himself as a supporter of her writing.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p = 307}}\n\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in ''Note G''),<ref name=\"fourmilab.ch\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html|title=Sketch of ''The Analytical Engine'', with notes upon the Memoir by the Translator|publisher=fourmilab.ch|place=Switzerland|date=October 1842|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]] using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built<ref name=\"adaslegacy\" /> (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage|title=The Babbage Engine|publisher=Computer History Museum|year=2008}}</ref> Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}} and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.<ref>Gleick, J.

She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Turing, Alan |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer [[algorithm]]]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University|year=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G.

[[Walter Isaacson]] ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to ''any'' process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used [[punched cards|punchcards]] to direct the weaving of beautiful [[pattern]]s, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/ |title=Walter Isaacson on the Women of ENIAC |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |date=18 September 2014 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}</ref> This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer [[John Graham-Cumming]], whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=2\u20133, 14}}{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=272\u201377}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Leo|url=http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|title=The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine|publisher=Humans Invent|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123843/http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist [[Doron Swade]]: <blockquote>Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw\u2014what Ada Byron saw\u2014was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy over her actual contribution===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.

Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did.\"<ref name=\"Wolfram\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Stephen|title=Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People|date=2016|publisher=Wolfram Media|isbn=1579550037|pages=45\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[Doron Swade]], a specialist on [[history of computing]] known for his work on Babbage, analysed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine:\n#She was a mathematical genius\n#She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\n#She was the first computer programmer\n#She was a prophet of the computer age\n\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.<ref>{{cite speech |last=Swade |first=Doron |author-link=Doron Swade |title=Charles Babbage and Difference Engine No. 2 |event=Talks at Google |date=12 May 2008 |location=Mountain View, CA |publisher=Talks at Google via YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K5p_tBcrd0&t=36m29s |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Ada Lovelace color.svg|thumb|upright|An illustration inspired by the [[A.

Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived [[insanity]]. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]].\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''.

She did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old.

She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation.

At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\n\n{{Quote|text=When Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the [[anatomy of birds]] to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, ''Flyology,'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>}}\n\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]]]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was [[debutante|presented at Court]] at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835, she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]], becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|title=Hon.

This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=340\u201342}} She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards.

She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King (physician)|William King]],<ref name=williamkings group=lower-alpha>William King, her tutor, and William King, her future husband, were not related.</ref> and [[Mary Somerville]], the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in ''one'' shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar{{Sfn|Toole|1998|p=99}}</blockquote>\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts.

Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=370}} She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=369}} She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\n\n==Work==\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including [[phrenology]]{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=198}} and [[mesmerism]].{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=232\u201333}} After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=305}} She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=310\u201314}} In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron [[Karl von Reichenbach]], ''Researches on Magnetism'', but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=315\u201317}} In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=335}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ada by British painter [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]] (1836)]]\nLovelace first met [[Charles Babbage]] in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his [[difference engine]].{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=36\u201338}} She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could.

With the article, she appended a set of notes.{{Sfn|Menabrea|1843}} Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=265}} Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=267}} Her work was well received at the time; the scientist [[Michael Faraday]] described himself as a supporter of her writing.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p = 307}}\n\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in ''Note G''),<ref name=\"fourmilab.ch\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html|title=Sketch of ''The Analytical Engine'', with notes upon the Memoir by the Translator|publisher=fourmilab.ch|place=Switzerland|date=October 1842|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]] using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built<ref name=\"adaslegacy\" /> (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage|title=The Babbage Engine|publisher=Computer History Museum|year=2008}}</ref> Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}} and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.<ref>Gleick, J.

She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Turing, Alan |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer [[algorithm]]]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University|year=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G.

[[Walter Isaacson]] ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to ''any'' process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used [[punched cards|punchcards]] to direct the weaving of beautiful [[pattern]]s, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/ |title=Walter Isaacson on the Women of ENIAC |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |date=18 September 2014 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}</ref> This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer [[John Graham-Cumming]], whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=2\u20133, 14}}{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=272\u201377}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Leo|url=http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|title=The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine|publisher=Humans Invent|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123843/http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist [[Doron Swade]]: <blockquote>Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw\u2014what Ada Byron saw\u2014was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy over her actual contribution===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.

Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did.\"<ref name=\"Wolfram\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Stephen|title=Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People|date=2016|publisher=Wolfram Media|isbn=1579550037|pages=45\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[Doron Swade]], a specialist on [[history of computing]] known for his work on Babbage, analysed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine:\n#She was a mathematical genius\n#She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\n#She was the first computer programmer\n#She was a prophet of the computer age\n\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.<ref>{{cite speech |last=Swade |first=Doron |author-link=Doron Swade |title=Charles Babbage and Difference Engine No. 2 |event=Talks at Google |date=12 May 2008 |location=Mountain View, CA |publisher=Talks at Google via YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K5p_tBcrd0&t=36m29s |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Ada Lovelace color.svg|thumb|upright|An illustration inspired by the [[A.
