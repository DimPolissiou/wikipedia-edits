The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother.

After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (film)]]''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 1\n| July 5, 1987\n| July 5, 1987\n| [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], [[Ken Topolsky]]\n| [[NBC]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network. The series is a television reboot set in the 2010s and chronicle [[Norman Bates]]' early childhood with his mother and how she drove him to become a killer. In July 2012, A&E ordered 10 episodes of the series, skipping the initial pilot stage. The series takes place in the modern day and stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as young Norman Bates and [[Vera Farmiga]] as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]]. The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie. The original interior sets have also been recreated.\n\n==Cast==\n===Principal cast===\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n*A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"14%\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\"  | Original series\n!

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]] running 91 minutes.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"4\" | Original series \n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (film)]]''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 1\n| July 5, 1987\n| July 5, 1987\n| [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]]\n| [[NBC]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network. The series is a television reboot set in the 2010s and chronicle [[Norman Bates]]' early childhood with his mother and how she drove him to become a killer. In July 2012, A&E ordered 10 episodes of the series, skipping the initial pilot stage. The series takes place in the modern day and stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as young Norman Bates and [[Vera Farmiga]] as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]]. The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie. The original interior sets have also been recreated.\n\n==Cast==\n===Principal cast===\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''List indicator(s)'''</center>\n*A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"14%\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\"  | Original series\n!

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth.

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

The program was formally criticised by [[Ofcom]], the UK broadcasting regulatory agency, which upheld complaints of misrepresentation made by [[David King (scientist)|David King]].\n\nThe film, made by British television producer [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]], presents scientists, economists, politicians, writers, and others who dispute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. The programme's publicity materials assert that man-made global warming is \"a lie\" and \"the biggest scam of modern times.\"<ref name=\"Webb_2007-03-07_Wt\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Global warming labeled a 'scam'|archivedate=8 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308093308/http://www.washtimes.com/world/20070306-122226-6282r.htm|url=http://www.washtimes.com/world/20070306-122226-6282r.htm |accessdate=6 June 2010 |work=The Washington Times |date=6 March 2007 |author=Al Webb}}</ref> Its original working title was \"Apocalypse my arse\", but the title ''The Great Global Warming Swindle'' was later adopted as an allusion to the 1980 [[mockumentary]]'' [[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]'' about British [[punk rock|punk]] band [[the Sex Pistols]].<ref>[http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2948/ 'Apocalypse my arse'], [[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked Online]], 9 March 2007</ref>\n\nThe UK's [[Channel 4]] premiered the documentary on 8 March 2007.

The film asserts that the publicised scientific consensus is the product of a \"global warming activist industry\" driven by a desire for research funding. Other culprits, according to the film, are Western environmentalists promoting expensive solar and wind power over cheap fossil fuels in Africa, resulting in African countries being held back from industrialising.\n\nThe film won best documentary award at the 2007 [[Io Isabella International Film Week]].<ref name = \"Io\" />\n\nA number of academics, environmentalists, think-tank consultants and writers are interviewed in the film in support of its various assertions.

The film asserts that records of atmospheric {{CO2}} levels since 1940 show a continuing increase, but during this period, global temperature decreased until 1975, and has after that increased until 1997.\n* '''Variations in warming rate.''' The programme states that all models of [[greenhouse effect]]-derived temperature increase predict that the warming will be at its greatest for a given location in the [[troposphere]] and at its lowest near the surface of the earth. The programme asserts that current [[satellite temperature measurements|satellite and weather balloon]] data do not support this model, and instead show that the surface warming rate is greater than or equal to the rate in the lower troposphere.\n* '''Increases in {{CO2}} and temperatures following the end of ice ages.''' According to the film, increases in {{CO2}} levels lagged (by over 100 years) behind temperature increases during glacial terminations.[[File:Co2-temperature-records.svg|thumb|[[EPICA]] and [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] ice cores display the relationship between temperature and level of {{CO2}} for the last 650,000 years. (\"Current CO<sub>2</sub> level\" is as of 2006.)]]\n* '''Relationship between atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] levels and temperature change.''' The film asserts that carbon dioxide levels increase or decrease as a result of temperatures increasing or decreasing rather than temperatures following carbon dioxide levels, because as the global climate cools the Earth's oceans absorb carbon dioxide, and as the climate warms the oceans release carbon dioxide.\n* '''Influence of oceanic mass on temperature changes.''' The programme argues that due to the very large mass of the world's oceans, it takes hundreds of years for global temperature changes to register in oceanic mass, which is why analysis of the [[Vostok Station]] and other [[ice core]]s shows that changes in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide [[attribution of recent climate change#Warming sometimes leads CO2 increases|follow changes in global temperature]] by 800 years.\n* '''Influence of [[water vapour]] on climate change.''' According to the film, water vapour makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases and has the largest impact on the planet's temperature. Water particles in the form of clouds act to reflect incoming solar heat, but the film argues that the effects of clouds cannot be accurately simulated by scientists attempting to predict future weather patterns and their effects on global warming.\n* '''Influence of carbon dioxide on climate change.''' The film states that carbon dioxide comprises only a very minuscule amount\u2014just 0.054% of the Earth's atmosphere. According to the film, human activity contributes much less than 1% of that, while volcanoes produce significantly more {{CO2}} per year than humans, while plants and animals produce 150 gigatons of {{CO2}} each year. Dying leaves produce even more {{CO2}}, and the oceans are \"the biggest source of {{CO2}} by far.\" Human activity produces a mere 6.5 gigatons of {{CO2}} each year. The film concludes that man-made {{CO2}} emissions alone cannot be causing global warming. (Durkin subsequently acknowledged that the claim about volcanic {{CO2}} emissions was wrong, and removed the claim from later versions.<ref name=\"MSNBC\">NBC News (25 April 2007). [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18307782 \"Scientists want edits to warming skeptic's film.\"]. Retrieved 2007-25-04.</ref>)\n* '''Influence of the sun on climate change.''' The film highlights the [[solar variation theory]] of global warming, asserting that [[Solar variation|solar activity]] is currently at an extremely high level, and that this is directly linked to changes in global temperature. The posited mechanism involves [[cosmic ray]]s as well as heat from the sun aiding cloud formation.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Celestial Climate Driver: A Perspective from Four Billion Years of the Carbon Cycle | url=http://www.gac.ca/publications/geoscience/GACV32No1Veizer.pdf | first=J\u00e1n | last=Veizer |date=March 2005|publisher=G\u00e9oscience Canada}}</ref> The film argues that the activity of the sun is far more influential on global warming and cooling than any other man-made or natural activity on Earth.\n* '''Previous episodes of warming.''' The programme asserts that the current episode of global warming is nothing unusual and temperatures were even more extreme during the [[Medieval Warm Period]], a time of great prosperity in western Europe.\n\n===Political issues===\nThe programme makes a number of assertions arguing that the integrity of climate research has been compromised by financial, ideological and political interests:\n\n* '''Increased funding of climate science.''' According to the film, there has been an increase in funds available for any research related to global warming \"and it is now one of the best funded areas of science.\"\n* '''Increased availability of funding for global warming research.''' The film asserts that scientists seeking a [[Research funding|research grant award]] have a much more likely chance of successfully obtaining funding if the grant is linked to global warming research.\n* '''Influence of vested interests.''' The programme argues that vested interests have a bigger impact on the proponents (rather than the detractors) of arguments supporting the occurrence of man-made global warming because hundreds of thousands of jobs in science, media, and government have been created and are subsidised as a result.\n* '''Suppression of dissenting views.''' According to the programme, scientists who speak out (against the view that global warming is man-made) risk persecution, death threats, loss of funding, personal attacks, and damage to their reputations.\n* '''Role of ideology.''' The film proposes that some supporters of the finding that global warming is man-made do so because it supports their emotional and ideological beliefs against capitalism, [[economic development]], [[globalisation]], industrialisation, and the United States.\n* '''Role of politics'''. The programme asserts that the view that global warming is man-made was promoted by the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as a means of promoting [[nuclear power]] and reducing the impact of strike action in the state-owned coal industry by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].\n* '''Role of industry.''' The film argues that the assertion that [[global warming denial]]ists are funded by private industry (such as oil, gas, and coal industries) are false and have no basis in fact.\n\n===Disputing the global warming consensus===\nThe film argues that the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|consensus among climate scientists]] about global warming does not exist.\n\n* '''Status of IPCC contributors'''. The programme asserts that it is falsely stated that \"2,500 top scientists\" support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)'s reports on global warming. In fact, according to the programme, the report includes many politicians and non-scientists, and even dissenters who demanded that their names be removed from the report but were refused.\n* '''Accuracy of representation of IPCC contributors.''' The film argues that IPCC reports misrepresent the views of scientists who contribute to them through selective editorialising. The film highlights the case of [[Paul Reiter]] of the [[Pasteur Institute]] who complained that the IPCC did not take his professional opinion under greater consideration. It states that the IPCC kept his name on the report as a contributor and did not remove his name until he threatened legal action.\n* '''Suppression of dissenting views.''' According to the programme, the concept of man-made global warming is promoted with a ferocity and intensity that is similar to a religious fervour. Denialists are treated as [[heresy|heretics]] and equated with [[holocaust denial|holocaust deniers]]. Retired university professor [[Tim Ball]] states in the film (and in subsequent press publicity) that he has received death threats because of sceptical statements he has made about global warming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/11/ngreen211.xml |title=Scientists threatened for 'climate denial' |accessdate=2007-05-20 |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Tom | last=Harper | date=11 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Killing the African dream of development===\n* Author and economist [[James Shikwati]] says in the programme that environmentalists campaign against Africa using its [[fossil fuel]]s: \"there's somebody keen to kill the African dream. And the African dream is to develop.\" He describes renewable power as \"luxurious experimentation\" that might work for rich countries but will never work for Africa: \"I don't see how a solar panel is going to power a steel industry \u2013 rather a transistor radio.\" We are being told, 'Don't touch your resources. Don't touch your oil. Don't touch your coal.' That is suicide.\"\n* The film describes a Kenyan health clinic that is powered by two solar panels that do not provide enough electricity for both the medical refrigerator and the lights at the same time. The programme describes the idea of restricting the world's poorest people to alternative energy sources as \"the most morally repugnant aspect of the Global Warming campaign.\"\n\n==Reception and criticism==\nThe show attracted 2.5 million viewers and an audience share of 11.5%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a43959/global-warming-swindle-sparks-debate.html |title= 'Global Warming Swindle' sparks debate |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> Channel 4 stated that it had received 758 calls and emails about the programme, with those in favour outnumbering complaints by six to one.\n\nFollowing criticism from scientists the film has been changed since it was first broadcast on Channel 4.

(2004) in ''Journal of Climate'']]\n\n* The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] was one of the main targets of the documentary. In response to the programme's broadcast, [[John T. Houghton]] (co-chair IPCC Scientific Assessment working group 1988\u20132002) assessed some of its main assertions and conclusions. According to Houghton the programme was \"a mixture of truth, half truth and falsehood put together with the sole purpose of discrediting the science of global warming,\" which he noted had been endorsed by the scientific community, including the Academies of Science of the [[G8|major industrialised countries]] and China, India and Brazil. Houghton rejected claims that observed changes in global average temperature are within the range of natural climate variability or that solar influences are the main driver; that the troposphere is warming less than the surface; that volcanic eruptions emit more carbon dioxide than fossil fuel burning; that [[Global climate model|climate models]] are too complex and uncertain to provide useful projections of climate change; and that IPCC processes were biased. Houghton acknowledges that ice core samples show {{CO2}} driven by temperature, but then writes that the programme's assertion that \"this correlation has been presented as the main evidence for global warming by the IPCC [is] NOT TRUE. For instance, I often show that diagram in my lectures on climate change but always make the point that it gives no proof of global warming due to increased carbon dioxide.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jri.org.uk/news/Critique_Channel4_Global_Warming_Swindle.pdf |title=Critique Channel4 Global Warming Swindle |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* The [[British Antarctic Survey]] released a statement about ''The Great Global Warming Swindle''. It is highly critical of the programme, singling out the use of a graph with the incorrect time axis, and also the statements made about solar activity: \"A comparison of the distorted and undistorted contemporary data reveal that the plot of solar activity bears no resemblance to the temperature curve, especially in the last 20 years.\" Comparing scientific methods with Channel 4's editorial standards, the statement says: \"Any scientist found to have falsified data in the manner of the Channel 4 programme would be guilty of serious professional misconduct.\" It uses the [[attribution of recent climate change#Warming sometimes leads CO2 increases|feedback argument]] to explain temperatures rising before {{CO2}}. On the issue of volcanic {{CO2}} emissions, it says:\n\n:<blockquote>A second issue was the claim that human emissions of {{CO2}} are small compared to natural emissions from volcanoes. This is untrue: current annual emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production are estimated to be around 100 times greater than average annual volcanic emissions of {{CO2}}. That large volcanoes cannot significantly perturb the {{CO2}} concentration of the atmosphere is apparent from the ice core and atmospheric record of {{CO2}} concentrations, which shows a steady rise during the industrial period, with no unusual changes after large eruptions.<ref name=\"antarctica1\" /> </blockquote>\n* Alan Thorpe, professor of meteorology at the [[University of Reading]] and Chief Executive of the UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]], commented on the film in ''[[New Scientist]]'': \"First, let's deal with the main thesis: that the presence or absence of cosmic rays in Earth's atmosphere is a better explanation for temperature variation than the concentration of {{CO2}} and other gases. This is not a new assertion and it is patently wrong: there is no credible evidence that cosmic rays play a significant role...Let scepticism reign, but let's not play games with the evidence.\"<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n| title = Fake fights are not helping climate science\n| last = Thorpe\n| first = Alan\n| journal = New Scientist\n| date = 17 March 2007\n| page = 24\n| ref = harv\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n* The [[Royal Society]] has issued a press release in reaction to the film. In it, [[Martin Rees]], the president of the Royal Society, briefly restates the predominant [[scientific opinion on climate change]] and adds:\n:<blockquote>Scientists will continue to monitor the global climate and the factors which influence it. It is important that all legitimate potential scientific explanations continue to be considered and investigated. Debate will continue, and the Royal Society has just hosted a two-day discussion meeting attended by over 300 scientists, but it must not be at the expense of action.

However it noted that the programme included his edited interview in the context of a range of scientists who denied the scientific consensus about the anthropogenic causes of global warming. In the Committee's view Professor Wunsch made clear in his full unedited interview that he largely accepted this consensus and the seriousness of the threat of global warming (albeit with caveats about proof) and therefore found that the presentation of Professor Wunsch's views, within the wider context of the programme, resulted in unfairness to him.</blockquote>\n\n* However, Ofcom did not uphold Wunsch's complaint that the programme misrepresented his views in relation to the oceans and {{CO2}}:\n\n:<blockquote>The Committee noted from the unedited interview that Professor Wunsch had referred to the greenhouse effect on a couple of occasions. However, in the Committee\u2019s opinion Professor Wunsch's comments in this respect had not been primarily to warn of the dangers of warming the ocean (as Professor Wunsch had suggested in his complaint). Rather the references had been used to make the point that the relationship between carbon dioxide and atmospheric temperature is complicated.

Friis-Christensen, with environmental Research Fellow Nathan Rive, criticised the way the solar data were used:\n\n<blockquote>We have concerns regarding the use of a graph featured in the documentary titled 'Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years'. Firstly, we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine. The inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless. Secondly, although the narrator commentary during the presentation of the graph is consistent with the conclusions of the paper from which the figure originates, it incorrectly rules out a contribution by anthropogenic greenhouse gases to 20th century global warming.<ref name=\"Friis-Christensen\">{{Cite web|url=http://folk.uio.no/nathan/web/statement.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620094936/http://folk.uio.no/nathan/web/statement.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|title=Regarding: \"The Great Global Warming Swindle\", broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 on 8 March 2007}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn response to a question from ''[[The Independent]]'' as to whether the programme was scientifically accurate, Friis-Christensen said: \"No, I think several points were not explained in the way that I, as a scientist, would have explained them&nbsp;... it is obvious it's not accurate.\"\n\nFollowing Eigil Friis-Christensen's criticism of the 'Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years' graph used in the programme (for perfectly matching the lines in the 100 years 1610\u20131710 where data did not in fact exist in the original), Durkin emailed Friis-Christensen to thank him for highlighting the error: \"it is an annoying mistake which all of us missed and is being fixed for all future transmissions of the film.

Regarding the Carl Wunsch controversy (see above), he repeated that Wunsch was not duped into taking part in the programme. (Ofcom later ruled against Durkin on this point.)\n\nDurkin went on to reject his opponents' position that the cooling period observed post Second World War was caused by [[Attribution of recent climate change#Attribution of 20th century climate change|sulfate aerosol cooling]]: \"Thanks to China and the rest, [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] levels are far, far higher now than they were back then. Why isn't it perishing cold?\" He concluded by saying that the \"global warming alarm...is wrong, wrong, wrong.\"\n\nCommenting at a [[Cannes film festival]] press conference on 17 April 2007, Durkin noted: \"My name is absolute mud on the Internet; it's really vicious,\" adding \"There is no good scientific basis for it but the theory continues to hold sway because so many people have built their careers and reputations on it.\"<ref>{{Cite news| title='Swindle' goes global&nbsp;\u2013 Australia, Sweden buy docu | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963243.html?categoryid=19&cs=1 | first=Alison | last=James |work=Variety | date=17 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-28 }}</ref>\n\n===The Armand Leroi correspondence===\n''[[The Times]]'' reported that Durkin had seriously fallen out with a scientist who had been considering working with him. [[Armand Leroi]], a geneticist, was concerned that Durkin had used data about a correlation between solar activity and global temperatures that was subsequently found to be flawed. Leroi sent Durkin an e-mail in which he said that he thought the programme \"made some good points (the politics of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]) and some bad points (anthropogenic global warming is a conspiracy to keep Africa underdeveloped),\" but said what had most interested him were some of the scientific claims about solar activity and global temperature. He said he looked for citations of the 1991 Friis-Christensen scientific paper used in the programme.\n\nWhile Leroi acknowledged \"I am no climate scientist,\" he said that after reviewing criticisms of the paper, he had become convinced that: \"To put this bluntly: the data that you showed in your programme were wrong\u2013and may have been deliberately faked... it does show what abundant experience has already taught me\u2013that, left to their own devices, TV producers simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth.\"<ref name=\"Leroi emails\" />\n\nLeroi copied the e-mail to other parties including ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist and Bad Science columnist [[Ben Goldacre]] and science writer and mathematics expert [[Simon Singh]]. Durkin replied to all with the single sentence: \"You\u2019re a big daft cock\". Singh then sent an email to Durkin that said: \"I have not paid the same attention to your programme as Armand has done, but from what I did see it is an irresponsible piece of film-making. If you can send me a copy of the programme then I will examine it in more detail and give you a more considered response...it would be great if you could engage in the debate rather just resorting to one line replies\".\n\nDurkin responded: \"The IPCC's own figures show the hottest year in the past ten was 1998, and the temp has been flat-lining now for five years. If it's greenhouse gas causing the warming the rate of warming should be higher in the troposphere than on the surface. The opposite is the case. The ice core data shows that temperature change causes the level of atmospheric {{CO2}} to change&nbsp;\u2014 not the other way round.

Ofcom also backed complaints by Sir [[David King (scientist)|David King]], stating that his views were misrepresented, and [[Carl Wunsch]], on the points that he had been misled as to its intent, and that the impression had been given that he agreed with the programme's position on climate change. Ofcom further ruled that the IPCC had not been given an adequate chance to respond to adverse claims that its work was politicised and that it had made misleading claims about [[malaria]]. However, the regulator said that because \"the link between human activity and global warming... became settled before March 2007\", in parts 1\u20134 the audience was not \"materially misled so as to cause harm or offence\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7517101.stm Climate documentary 'broke rules'] [[BBC News]], 21 July 2008</ref> According to Ofcom the program caused no harm because \"the discussion about the causes of global warming was to a very great extent settled by the date of broadcast\", meaning that climate change was no longer a matter of political controversy.<ref>[http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/07/21/distortions-falsehoods-fabrications/ Monbiot article]</ref>\n\n[[Channel 4]] said in its defence against the complaints that ''The Great Global Warming Swindle'' \"was clearly identified as an authored polemic of the kind that is characteristic of some of Channel 4\u2019s output\", and Ofcom said in its decision that it was \"of paramount importance that broadcasters, such as Channel 4, continue to explore controversial subject matter\". Ofcom declined to rule on the accuracy of the programme, saying: \"It is not within Ofcom's remit or ability in this case as the regulator of the 'communications industry' to establish or seek to adjudicate on 'facts' such as whether global warming is a man-made phenomenon.\" It noted that it only regulates \"misleading material where that material is likely to cause harm or offence\" and \"as a consequence, the requirement that content must not materially mislead the audience is necessarily a high test.\"<ref name=\"Sweney\" />\n\nThe regulator ruled that the parts of the programme about the scientific debate \"were not matters of political or industrial controversy or matters relating to public policy and therefore the rules on due impartiality did not apply.\" In the fifth segment of the programme concerning the political controversy and public policy, however, Ofcom ruled that the programme-makers were \"required to include an appropriate wide range of the significant views\" but \"failed to do this.\"<ref name=\"Sweney\" /> Channel 4 was required to broadcast a summary of the Ofcom ruling but was given no further sanctions.\n\n===General responses===\n[[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]], a former chair of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], also welcomed [[Ofcom]]'s ruling that the film had committed a number of breaches of the broadcasting code but expressed disappointment \"that Ofcom did not find that the programme materially misled the audience as to cause harm or offence.\" He characterised the film as inaccurate, not impartial, unbalanced and misrepresentative of the scientific consensus on climate change.<ref>Watson, Robert. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/ofcom.channel4 The public has been swindled]\".

Pachauri]], the former chair of the IPCC, welcomed the ruling as \"a vindication of the credibility and standing of the IPCC and the manner in which we function, and [it] clearly brings out the distortion in whatever [[Channel 4]] was trying to project.\"<ref name=\"Black\" /> The Royal Society's head, [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Lord Rees]], issued a statement in response to the ruling, commenting: \"TV companies occasionally commission programmes just to court controversy, but to misrepresent the evidence on an issue as important as global warming was surely irresponsible.

It said that there were some things that weren't right, but ultimately it has exonerated us.</blockquote>\n\nWhile he said that he regretted that 'there were some breaches of the code' he said there was \"a degree\" to which he disagreed with the complaints they upheld:\n<blockquote>On the complaint from Sir David King, there was a quote by a contributor in the film that was wrong, which he had wrongly picked up from someone else and was quoting. On the second point regarding the IPCC, Ofcom decided that we didn't give it enough time to respond to the allegations presented. We gave them 10 days, so you can decide as to whether you feel that's enough time. And on the complaint from Carl Wunsch, he complained that we hadn't made it significantly clear he would be appearing on a polemic climate change programme. But we told him we were going to explore the issues of the counter argument to global warming and he got the same letter as everyone else, and no-one else claimed they didn't know what they'd be appearing on.</blockquote>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* Shortlisted in the Best Documentary category in the British television industry's 2008 Broadcast awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/G/great_global_warming_swindle/|accessdate=2008-09-01|title=The Great Global Warming Swindle|publisher=Channel 4}}</ref>\n* Best Documentary at the [[Io Isabella International Film Week]] held in southern Italy.<ref name=\"Io\" >{{Cite web|url=http://ioisabellablog.blogspot.com/search/label/2007|accessdate=2010-09-18|title=And the winners are...|publisher=Io, Isabella International Film Week|year=2007}}</ref>\n* Jury's Special Mention ''for courageous contribution to the scientific dialogue and for the quality of cinematography'' in the 3rd International Science Film Festival Awards 2008 held in Athens.<ref name=\"ISFF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.caid.gr/isffa/isffa2008/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205120249/http://www.caid.gr/isffa/isffa2008/about.html |archivedate=5 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Contributors to the programme==\nThe film includes appearances from the following individuals:\n\n* [[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]]&nbsp;\u2013 Professor and Director, [[International Arctic Research Center]]\n* [[Tim Ball]]&nbsp;\u2013 Head of the [[Natural Resources Stewardship Project]] (Misidentified in the film as Professor from the Department of Climatology, [[University of Winnipeg]].

The film asserts that the publicised scientific consensus is the product of a \"global warming activist industry\" driven by a desire for research funding. Other culprits, according to the film, are Western environmentalists promoting expensive solar and wind power over cheap fossil fuels in Africa, resulting in African countries being held back from industrialising.\n\nThe film won best documentary award at the 2007 [[Io Isabella International Film Week]].<ref name = \"Io\" />\n\nA number of academics, environmentalists, think-tank consultants and writers are interviewed in the film in support of its various assertions.

The film asserts that records of atmospheric {{CO2}} levels since 1940 show a continuing increase, but during this period, global temperature decreased until 1975, and has after that increased until 1997.\n* '''Variations in warming rate.''' The programme states that all models of greenhouse effect-derived temperature increase predict that the warming will be at its greatest for a given location in the [[troposphere]] and at its lowest near the surface of the earth. The programme asserts that current [[satellite temperature measurements|satellite and weather balloon]] data do not support this model, and instead show that the surface warming rate is greater than or equal to the rate in the lower troposphere.\n* '''Increases in {{CO2}} and temperatures following the end of ice ages.''' According to the film, increases in {{CO2}} levels lagged (by over 100 years) behind temperature increases during glacial terminations.[[File:Co2-temperature-records.svg|thumb|[[EPICA]] and [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] ice cores display the relationship between temperature and level of {{CO2}} for the last 650,000 years. (\"Current CO<sub>2</sub> level\" is as of 2006.)]]\n* '''Relationship between atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] levels and temperature change.''' The film asserts that carbon dioxide levels increase or decrease as a result of temperatures increasing or decreasing rather than temperatures following carbon dioxide levels, because as the global climate cools the Earth's oceans absorb carbon dioxide, and as the climate warms the oceans release carbon dioxide.\n* '''Influence of oceanic mass on temperature changes.''' The programme argues that due to the very large mass of the world's oceans, it takes hundreds of years for global temperature changes to register in oceanic mass, which is why analysis of the [[Vostok Station]] and other [[ice core]]s shows that changes in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide [[attribution of recent climate change#Warming sometimes leads CO2 increases|follow changes in global temperature]] by 800 years.\n* '''Influence of [[water vapour]] on climate change.''' According to the film, water vapour makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases and has the largest impact on the planet's temperature. Water particles in the form of clouds act to reflect incoming solar heat, but the film argues that the effects of clouds cannot be accurately simulated by scientists attempting to predict future weather patterns and their effects on global warming.\n* '''Influence of carbon dioxide on climate change.''' The film states that carbon dioxide comprises only a very minuscule amount\u2014just 0.054% of the Earth's atmosphere. According to the film, human activity contributes much less than 1% of that, while volcanoes produce significantly more {{CO2}} per year than humans, while plants and animals produce 150 gigatons of {{CO2}} each year. Dying leaves produce even more {{CO2}}, and the oceans are \"the biggest source of {{CO2}} by far.\" Human activity produces a mere 6.5 gigatons of {{CO2}} each year. The film concludes that man-made {{CO2}} emissions alone cannot be causing global warming. (Durkin subsequently acknowledged that the claim about volcanic {{CO2}} emissions was wrong, and removed the claim from later versions.<ref name=\"MSNBC\">NBC News (25 April 2007). [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18307782 \"Scientists want edits to warming skeptic's film.\"]. Retrieved 2007-25-04.</ref>)\n* '''Influence of the sun on climate change.''' The film highlights the [[solar variation theory]] of global warming, asserting that [[Solar variation|solar activity]] is currently at an extremely high level, and that this is directly linked to changes in global temperature. The posited mechanism involves [[cosmic ray]]s as well as heat from the sun aiding cloud formation.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Celestial Climate Driver: A Perspective from Four Billion Years of the Carbon Cycle | url=http://www.gac.ca/publications/geoscience/GACV32No1Veizer.pdf | first=J\u00e1n | last=Veizer |date=March 2005|publisher=G\u00e9oscience Canada}}</ref> The film argues that the activity of the sun is far more influential on global warming and cooling than any other man-made or natural activity on Earth.\n* '''Previous episodes of warming.''' The programme asserts that the current episode of global warming is nothing unusual and temperatures were even more extreme during the [[Medieval Warm Period]], a time of great prosperity in western Europe.\n\n===Political issues===\nThe programme makes a number of assertions arguing that the integrity of climate research has been compromised by financial, ideological and political interests:\n\n* '''Increased funding of climate science.''' According to the film, there has been an increase in funds available for any research related to global warming \"and it is now one of the best funded areas of science.\"\n* '''Increased availability of funding for global warming research.''' The film asserts that scientists seeking a [[Research funding|research grant award]] have a much more likely chance of successfully obtaining funding if the grant is linked to global warming research.\n* '''Influence of vested interests.''' The programme argues that vested interests have a bigger impact on the proponents (rather than the detractors) of arguments supporting the occurrence of man-made global warming because hundreds of thousands of jobs in science, media, and government have been created and are subsidised as a result.\n* '''Suppression of dissenting views.''' According to the programme, scientists who speak out (against the view that global warming is man-made) risk persecution, death threats, loss of funding, personal attacks, and damage to their reputations.\n* '''Role of ideology.''' The film proposes that some supporters of the finding that global warming is man-made do so because it supports their emotional and ideological beliefs against capitalism, [[economic development]], [[globalisation]], industrialisation, and the United States.\n* '''Role of politics'''. The programme asserts that the view that global warming is man-made was promoted by the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as a means of promoting [[nuclear power]] and reducing the impact of strike action in the state-owned coal industry by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].\n* '''Role of industry.''' The film argues that the assertion that [[global warming denial]]ists are funded by private industry (such as oil, gas, and coal industries) are false and have no basis in fact.\n\n===Disputing the global warming consensus===\nThe film argues that the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|consensus among climate scientists]] about global warming does not exist.\n\n* '''Status of IPCC contributors'''. The programme asserts that it is falsely stated that \"2,500 top scientists\" support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)'s reports on global warming. In fact, according to the programme, the report includes many politicians and non-scientists, and even dissenters who demanded that their names be removed from the report but were refused.\n* '''Accuracy of representation of IPCC contributors.''' The film argues that IPCC reports misrepresent the views of scientists who contribute to them through selective editorialising. The film highlights the case of [[Paul Reiter]] of the [[Pasteur Institute]] who complained that the IPCC did not take his professional opinion under greater consideration. It states that the IPCC kept his name on the report as a contributor and did not remove his name until he threatened legal action.\n* '''Suppression of dissenting views.''' According to the programme, the concept of man-made global warming is promoted with a ferocity and intensity that is similar to a religious fervour. Denialists are treated as [[heresy|heretics]] and equated with [[holocaust denial|holocaust deniers]]. Retired university professor [[Tim Ball]] states in the film (and in subsequent press publicity) that he has received death threats because of sceptical statements he has made about global warming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/11/ngreen211.xml |title=Scientists threatened for 'climate denial' |accessdate=2007-05-20 |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Tom | last=Harper | date=11 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Killing the African dream of development===\n* Author and economist [[James Shikwati]] says in the programme that environmentalists campaign against Africa using its [[fossil fuel]]s: \"there's somebody keen to kill the African dream. And the African dream is to develop.\" He describes renewable power as \"luxurious experimentation\" that might work for rich countries but will never work for Africa: \"I don't see how a solar panel is going to power a steel industry \u2013 rather a transistor radio.\" We are being told, 'Don't touch your resources. Don't touch your oil. Don't touch your coal.' That is suicide.\"\n* The film describes a Kenyan health clinic that is powered by two solar panels that do not provide enough electricity for both the medical refrigerator and the lights at the same time. The programme describes the idea of restricting the world's poorest people to alternative energy sources as \"the most morally repugnant aspect of the Global Warming campaign.\"\n\n==Reception and criticism==\nThe show attracted 2.5 million viewers and an audience share of 11.5%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a43959/global-warming-swindle-sparks-debate.html |title= 'Global Warming Swindle' sparks debate |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> Channel 4 stated that it had received 758 calls and emails about the programme, with those in favour outnumbering complaints by six to one.\n\nFollowing criticism from scientists the film has been changed since it was first broadcast on Channel 4.

(2004) in ''Journal of Climate'']]\n\n* The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] was one of the main targets of the documentary. In response to the programme's broadcast, [[John T. Houghton]] (co-chair IPCC Scientific Assessment working group 1988\u20132002) assessed some of its main assertions and conclusions. According to Houghton the programme was \"a mixture of truth, half truth and falsehood put together with the sole purpose of discrediting the science of global warming,\" which he noted had been endorsed by the scientific community, including the Academies of Science of the [[G8|major industrialised countries]] and China, India and Brazil. Houghton rejected claims that observed changes in global average temperature are within the range of natural climate variability or that solar influences are the main driver; that the troposphere is warming less than the surface; that volcanic eruptions emit more carbon dioxide than fossil fuel burning; that [[Global climate model|climate models]] are too complex and uncertain to provide useful projections of climate change; and that IPCC processes were biased. Houghton acknowledges that ice core samples show {{CO2}} driven by temperature, but then writes that the programme's assertion that \"this correlation has been presented as the main evidence for global warming by the IPCC [is] NOT TRUE. For instance, I often show that diagram in my lectures on climate change but always make the point that it gives no proof of global warming due to increased carbon dioxide.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jri.org.uk/news/Critique_Channel4_Global_Warming_Swindle.pdf |title=Critique Channel4 Global Warming Swindle |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* The [[British Antarctic Survey]] released a statement about ''The Great Global Warming Swindle''. It is highly critical of the programme, singling out the use of a graph with the incorrect time axis, and also the statements made about solar activity: \"A comparison of the distorted and undistorted contemporary data reveal that the plot of solar activity bears no resemblance to the temperature curve, especially in the last 20 years.\" Comparing scientific methods with Channel 4's editorial standards, the statement says: \"Any scientist found to have falsified data in the manner of the Channel 4 programme would be guilty of serious professional misconduct.\" It uses the [[attribution of recent climate change#Warming sometimes leads CO2 increases|feedback argument]] to explain temperatures rising before {{CO2}}. On the issue of volcanic {{CO2}} emissions, it says:\n\n:<blockquote>A second issue was the claim that human emissions of {{CO2}} are small compared to natural emissions from volcanoes. This is untrue: current annual emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production are estimated to be around 100 times greater than average annual volcanic emissions of {{CO2}}. That large volcanoes cannot significantly perturb the {{CO2}} concentration of the atmosphere is apparent from the ice core and atmospheric record of {{CO2}} concentrations, which shows a steady rise during the industrial period, with no unusual changes after large eruptions.<ref name=\"antarctica1\" /> </blockquote>\n* Alan Thorpe, professor of meteorology at the [[University of Reading]] and Chief Executive of the UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]], commented on the film in ''[[New Scientist]]'': \"First, let's deal with the main thesis: that the presence or absence of cosmic rays in Earth's atmosphere is a better explanation for temperature variation than the concentration of {{CO2}} and other gases. This is not a new assertion and it is patently wrong: there is no credible evidence that cosmic rays play a significant role...Let scepticism reign, but let's not play games with the evidence.\"<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n| title = Fake fights are not helping climate science\n| last = Thorpe\n| first = Alan\n| journal = New Scientist\n| date = 17 March 2007\n| page = 24\n| ref = harv\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n* The [[Royal Society]] has issued a press release in reaction to the film. In it, [[Martin Rees]], the president of the Royal Society, briefly restates the predominant [[scientific opinion on climate change]] and adds:\n:<blockquote>Scientists will continue to monitor the global climate and the factors which influence it. It is important that all legitimate potential scientific explanations continue to be considered and investigated. Debate will continue, and the Royal Society has just hosted a two-day discussion meeting attended by over 300 scientists, but it must not be at the expense of action.

However it noted that the programme included his edited interview in the context of a range of scientists who denied the scientific consensus about the anthropogenic causes of global warming. In the Committee's view Professor Wunsch made clear in his full unedited interview that he largely accepted this consensus and the seriousness of the threat of global warming (albeit with caveats about proof) and therefore found that the presentation of Professor Wunsch's views, within the wider context of the programme, resulted in unfairness to him.</blockquote>\n\n* However, Ofcom did not uphold Wunsch's complaint that the programme misrepresented his views in relation to the oceans and {{CO2}}:\n\n:<blockquote>The Committee noted from the unedited interview that Professor Wunsch had referred to the greenhouse effect on a couple of occasions. However, in the Committee\u2019s opinion Professor Wunsch's comments in this respect had not been primarily to warn of the dangers of warming the ocean (as Professor Wunsch had suggested in his complaint).

Firstly, we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine. The inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless.

Regarding the Carl Wunsch controversy (see above), he repeated that Wunsch was not duped into taking part in the programme. (Ofcom later ruled against Durkin on this point.)\n\nDurkin went on to reject his opponents' position that the cooling period observed post Second World War was caused by [[Attribution of recent climate change#Attribution of 20th century climate change|sulfate aerosol cooling]]: \"Thanks to China and the rest, [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] levels are far, far higher now than they were back then. Why isn't it perishing cold?\" He concluded by saying that the \"global warming alarm...is wrong, wrong, wrong.\"\n\nCommenting at a [[Cannes film festival]] press conference on 17 April 2007, Durkin noted: \"My name is absolute mud on the Internet; it's really vicious,\" adding \"There is no good scientific basis for it but the theory continues to hold sway because so many people have built their careers and reputations on it.\"<ref>{{Cite news| title='Swindle' goes global&nbsp;\u2013 Australia, Sweden buy docu | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963243.html?categoryid=19&cs=1 | first=Alison | last=James |work=Variety | date=17 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-28 }}</ref>\n\n===The Armand Leroi correspondence===\n''[[The Times]]'' reported that Durkin had seriously fallen out with a scientist who had been considering working with him. [[Armand Leroi]], a geneticist, was concerned that Durkin had used data about a correlation between solar activity and global temperatures that was subsequently found to be flawed. Leroi sent Durkin an e-mail in which he said that he thought the programme \"made some good points (the politics of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]) and some bad points (anthropogenic global warming is a conspiracy to keep Africa underdeveloped),\" but said what had most interested him were some of the scientific claims about solar activity and global temperature. He said he looked for citations of the 1991 Friis-Christensen scientific paper used in the programme.\n\nWhile Leroi acknowledged \"I am no climate scientist,\" he said that after reviewing criticisms of the paper, he had become convinced that: \"To put this bluntly: the data that you showed in your programme were wrong\u2013and may have been deliberately faked... it does show what abundant experience has already taught me\u2013that, left to their own devices, TV producers simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth.\"<ref name=\"Leroi emails\" />\n\nLeroi copied the e-mail to other parties including ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist and Bad Science columnist [[Ben Goldacre]] and science writer and mathematics expert [[Simon Singh]]. Durkin replied to all with the single sentence: \"You\u2019re a big daft cock\". Singh then sent an email to Durkin that said: \"I have not paid the same attention to your programme as Armand has done, but from what I did see it is an irresponsible piece of film-making. If you can send me a copy of the programme then I will examine it in more detail and give you a more considered response...it would be great if you could engage in the debate rather just resorting to one line replies\".\n\nDurkin responded: \"The IPCC's own figures show the hottest year in the past ten was 1998, and the temp has been flat-lining now for five years. If it's greenhouse gas causing the warming the rate of warming should be higher in the troposphere than on the surface. The opposite is the case. The ice core data shows that temperature change causes the level of atmospheric {{CO2}} to change&nbsp;\u2014 not the other way round. Why have we not heard this in the hours and hours of shit programming on global warming shoved down our throats by the BBC?\", and concluded with, \"Never mind a bit of irresponsible film-making.

Ofcom also backed complaints by Sir [[David King (scientist)|David King]], stating that his views were misrepresented, and [[Carl Wunsch]], on the points that he had been misled as to its intent, and that the impression had been given that he agreed with the programme's position on climate change. Ofcom further ruled that the IPCC had not been given an adequate chance to respond to adverse claims that its work was politicised and that it had made misleading claims about [[malaria]]. However, the regulator said that because \"the link between human activity and global warming... became settled before March 2007\", in parts 1\u20134 the audience was not \"materially misled so as to cause harm or offence\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7517101.stm Climate documentary 'broke rules'] [[BBC News]], 21 July 2008</ref> According to Ofcom the program caused no harm because \"the discussion about the causes of global warming was to a very great extent settled by the date of broadcast\", meaning that climate change was no longer a matter of political controversy.<ref>[http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/07/21/distortions-falsehoods-fabrications/ Monbiot article]</ref>\n\n[[Channel 4]] said in its defence against the complaints that ''The Great Global Warming Swindle'' \"was clearly identified as an authored polemic of the kind that is characteristic of some of Channel 4\u2019s output\", and Ofcom said in its decision that it was \"of paramount importance that broadcasters, such as Channel 4, continue to explore controversial subject matter\". Ofcom declined to rule on the accuracy of the programme, saying: \"It is not within Ofcom's remit or ability in this case as the regulator of the 'communications industry' to establish or seek to adjudicate on 'facts' such as whether global warming is a man-made phenomenon.\" It noted that it only regulates \"misleading material where that material is likely to cause harm or offence\" and \"as a consequence, the requirement that content must not materially mislead the audience is necessarily a high test.\"<ref name=\"Sweney\" />\n\nThe regulator ruled that the parts of the programme about the scientific debate \"were not matters of political or industrial controversy or matters relating to public policy and therefore the rules on due impartiality did not apply.\" In the fifth segment of the programme concerning the political controversy and public policy, however, Ofcom ruled that the programme-makers were \"required to include an appropriate wide range of the significant views\" but \"failed to do this.\"<ref name=\"Sweney\" /> Channel 4 was required to broadcast a summary of the Ofcom ruling but was given no further sanctions.\n\n===General responses===\n[[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]], a former chair of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], also welcomed [[Ofcom]]'s ruling that the film had committed a number of breaches of the broadcasting code but expressed disappointment \"that Ofcom did not find that the programme materially misled the audience as to cause harm or offence.\" He characterised the film as inaccurate, not impartial, unbalanced and misrepresentative of the scientific consensus on climate change.<ref>Watson, Robert. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/ofcom.channel4 The public has been swindled]\". ''The Guardian'', 28 July 2008</ref> Another former IPCC chair, Sir [[John T.

Pachauri]], the former chair of the IPCC, welcomed the ruling as \"a vindication of the credibility and standing of the IPCC and the manner in which we function, and [it] clearly brings out the distortion in whatever [[Channel 4]] was trying to project.\"<ref name=\"Black\" /> The Royal Society's head, [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Lord Rees]], issued a statement in response to the ruling, commenting: \"TV companies occasionally commission programmes just to court controversy, but to misrepresent the evidence on an issue as important as global warming was surely irresponsible.

It said that there were some things that weren't right, but ultimately it has exonerated us.</blockquote>\n\nWhile he said that he regretted that 'there were some breaches of the code' he said there was \"a degree\" to which he disagreed with the complaints they upheld:\n<blockquote>On the complaint from Sir David King, there was a quote by a contributor in the film that was wrong, which he had wrongly picked up from someone else and was quoting. On the second point regarding the IPCC, Ofcom decided that we didn't give it enough time to respond to the allegations presented. We gave them 10 days, so you can decide as to whether you feel that's enough time. And on the complaint from Carl Wunsch, he complained that we hadn't made it significantly clear he would be appearing on a polemic climate change programme. But we told him we were going to explore the issues of the counter argument to global warming and he got the same letter as everyone else, and no-one else claimed they didn't know what they'd be appearing on.</blockquote>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* Shortlisted in the Best Documentary category in the British television industry's 2008 Broadcast awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/G/great_global_warming_swindle/|accessdate=2008-09-01|title=The Great Global Warming Swindle|publisher=Channel 4}}</ref>\n* Best Documentary at the [[Io Isabella International Film Week]] held in southern Italy.<ref name=\"Io\" >{{Cite web|url=http://ioisabellablog.blogspot.com/search/label/2007|accessdate=2010-09-18|title=And the winners are...|publisher=Io, Isabella International Film Week|year=2007}}</ref>\n* Jury's Special Mention ''for courageous contribution to the scientific dialogue and for the quality of cinematography'' in the 3rd International Science Film Festival Awards 2008 held in Athens.<ref name=\"ISFF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.caid.gr/isffa/isffa2008/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205120249/http://www.caid.gr/isffa/isffa2008/about.html |archivedate=5 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Contributors to the programme==\nThe film includes appearances from the following individuals:\n\n* [[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]]&nbsp;\u2013 Professor and Director, [[International Arctic Research Center]]\n* [[Tim Ball]]&nbsp;\u2013 Head of the [[Natural Resources Stewardship Project]] (Misidentified in the film as Professor from the Department of Climatology, [[University of Winnipeg]].

After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with [[3D Robotics]] (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines.

The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called \"SuperView\") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30\u201350% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps.<ref>[http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-silver-edition HERO3+ Silver Edition]</ref> In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%\u201350% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color.

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{short description|American technology company}}\n{{about|the company|the song|Ride On (Texas Hippie Coalition album) }}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = GoPro, Inc.hh\n| logo = GoPro logo light.svg\n| former_names = Woodman Labs, Inc.\n| type = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as = {{NASDAQ|GPRO}} (Class A)<br>[[Russell 2000 Index|Russell 2000 Component]]\n| industry = {{flatlist|\n*[[Technology]]\n*[[Videography]]\n*[[Consumer electronics]]\n}}\n| foundation = {{Start date and age|2002}}\n| founder = [[Nick Woodman]]\n| location_city = [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[California]]\n| area_served = Worldwide\n| key_people = {{plainlist|\n*[[Nick Woodman]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]])\n}}\n| products = {{flatlist|\n*[[Action camera]]\n*[[Video editing software]]\n*[[Mobile app]]\n}}\n| brands = Authentic design logo Andi Nugraha [[alt]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}\n| revenue = {{decrease}} [[United States dollar|US$]]1.18 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\">{{cite web|title=GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results |url=https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/GoPro-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2017-Results/default.aspx |publisher=GoPro |accessdate=April 3, 2018 |location=San Mateo, California |date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n| operating_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$163.46 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| net_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$182.87 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| assets = {{decrease}} US$0.85 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| equity = \n| num_employees = 964 (2019)\n| divisions = \n| subsid = {{plainlist|\n*[[CineForm]]\n*Replay\n*Splice\n}}\n| location_country = [[United States|U.S.]]\n| homepage = {{URL|https://www.gopro.com}}\n}}\n\n'''GoPro, Inc.'''<ref name=\"sec-filing\">{{cite web|title= FORM S-1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT \u2013 GOPRO, INC. |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000119312514204902/d552193ds1.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |access-date= May 21, 2014}}</ref> (marketed as '''GoPro''' and sometimes stylized as '''GoPRO''') is an [[United States|American]] [[technology]] company founded in 2002 by [[Nick Woodman]].

After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with [[3D Robotics]] (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines.

The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called \"SuperView\") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30\u201350% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps.<ref>[http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-silver-edition HERO3+ Silver Edition]</ref> In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%\u201350% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color.

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "name_user": "Vanisaac", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correcting spelling: upto->up to", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro"}

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

The professional associations of Bulgarian lawyers, physicians, craftsmen and the Union of Artists' Societies opposed the law with petitions.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The Holy Synod, governing body of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], was also quite critical, with high clergy such as [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Archbishop Stefan of Sofia]] and bishops Neofit of Vidin and [[Cyril of Bulgaria|Kyril of Plovdiv]] leading the opposition.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn January 1942, Germany outlined what it called the [[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

He was elected [[strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]] 17 times, leading the League through numerous military campaigns including the [[Cleomenean War]] and the [[Social War (220-217 BC)|Social War]].\n\nAratus was exiled to [[Argos, Greece|Argos]] at the age of seven, after his father, the magistrate of [[Sicyon]], was killed in a coup. In 251 BC, he led an expedition composed of other exiles which freed Sicyon from tyranny, and assumed power in the city. Sicyon joined the [[Achaean League]], in which Aratus would later be elected ''[[strategos]]''. In his first major campaign as strategos, he seized the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]]-held citadel of [[Acrocorinth]], previously believed impregnable.\n\nAfter conquering the Acrocorinth, Aratus pursued the Achaean League's expansion. When the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes III]] conquered the Achaean cities of Argos and Corinth, Aratus succeeded in securing an alliance with his erstwhile enemy, Macedon. Cleomenes III was defeated at the [[Battle of Sellasia]] by the joint forces of the Achaean League and [[Antigonus III Doson]], the regent of Macedon. During the Social War against the [[Aetolian League]], Aratus became one of the prime advisors of the new king of Macedon, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]]. Aratus died in 213 BC, allegedly poisoned by Philip.\n\n==Youth==\n\n[[File:Korinth Isthmus de.png|thumb|250x250px|Location of Sicyon|alt=|left]]\n[[File:Theater Sikyon.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Sicyon's theatre, built by Aratus' father|alt=]]\n\nAratus was born in 271 BC in the northern [[Peloponnese]] [[city-state]] of [[Sicyon]]. His father, Cleinias of Sicyon, had become head magistrate of the city jointly with [[Timocleidas]] after the murder of the previous [[tyrant]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 2, 1</ref> Shortly after government stabilised, Timocleidas died. In 264 BC, [[Abantidas]] murdered Cleinias, and proclaimed himself tyrant. The seven-year-old Aratus escaped the coup with the help of his aunt{{refn|His aunt, Soso, was married to Cleinias' brother, Prophantus, and was also the sister of Abantidas.<ref name=\"RandB3\"/>|group=N}} who, in the confusion, was able to hide the boy until nightfall and then smuggle him out of Sicyon to [[Argos, Greece|Argos]]. He was raised in Argos by friends of his father, living there until 251 BC.<ref>F.W. Walbank, 1933, p. 3</ref><ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 175</ref>\n\nIn Argos, Aratus initially became known as a good athlete, winning a prize in the [[pentathlon]]. But he remained focused on the idea of freeing his home city's from tyranny. Despite his youth, he was able to gain widespread support among fellow exiles, becoming the leader of the exiles' party.<ref name=\"RandB3\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 3</ref>\n\nIn Sicyon, Abantidas was killed by two philosophers. Abantidas was replaced by his own father, who was subsequently killed and replaced by [[Nicocles (Sicyon)|Nicocles]]. Aratus began to seek support from the kings of [[Kingdom of Macedon|Macedon]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]]. [[Plutarch]] reports that Nicocles' main cause of concern about Aratus was the younger man's elevated connections.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 4, 2</ref>\n\n==Liberating Sicyon==\n\nIn 251 BC, Aratus had originally intended to take and hold a fortified post near Sicyon from which he could raid his enemies' property, and where sympathisers could join him. But a political prisoner recently escaped from the tyrant's prison in Sicyon suggested a better plan, saying that the escape route he had taken out of Sicyon could easily be used by men with ladders to get back into the city by scaling its defensive walls.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 5, 3</ref>\n\nAratus armed his men in secret. To mislead the tyrant's spies at Argos, he pretended to feast on the day of his planned coup. Once the spies had gone, Aratus joined his men waiting outside the city and led them to Sicyon, aiming to reach and scale the city walls while the light was still low. They were almost given away by the city's watchdogs, but the guards failed to recognise the danger. At dawn, the intruders took the barracks guards prisoner. The tyrant, Nicocles, managed to escape through a tunnel. Rumours of the attack spread fast across the city, and some of the citizens set fire to the tyrant's house. Aratus did not intervene to stop the looting, allowing citizens free rein after thirteen years of tyranny.<ref name=\"RandB5\"/>\n\n===Consolidating Sicyon===\n\n[[File:Antigonus Gonatas British Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Antigonus Gonatas]], king of [[Macedon]]]]\n\nAratus' first act after taking Sicyon was to call back its exiles. According to Plutarch, he recalled 80 who had been banished by Nicocles, and a further 500 besides them.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 9, 3</ref> The returning exiles sought to reclaim their confiscated property, and civil war threatened. Plutarch reports that one of the two kings Aratus had earlier petitioned for support gave him 25 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver as a personal gift and goodwill gesture. It is not clear whether this was [[Antigonus Gonatas]], king of Macedon, or [[Ptolemy II Philadelphos]], pharaoh of Egypt. Antigonus probably hoped that Aratus would prove a useful Macedonian puppet in the [[Peloponnese]]. Ptolemy had just won Corinth from the Macedonian empire, and would have liked to increase his success.<ref name=\"RandB5\"/> Aratus gave the money away to his fellow citizens and, probably also in 251 BC, decided to attach Sicyon to the [[Achaean League]]. It was the first time the League had admitted a non-[[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaean]] ''[[polis]]'' (Sicyon was [[Dorians|Dorian]]).<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\nBut Sicyon had become economically unstable. Aratus could now no longer rely for help on an alliance with Macedon's Antigonus, as the Achaean League was a rival of Macedon in Greece. He was left little choice but to turn to Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Egypt. Plutarch recounts the events of his journey to the court at Alexandria, from which he returned with 40 talents and the promise of another 110. Back in Sicyon, Aratus did not want sole responsibility for distributing the money, and established a committee which included himself and fifteen other members for the task. The funds received from Ptolemy II enabled Aratus to resolve the political problems in Sicyon. Grateful citizens erected a bronze statue to honour him.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', ''Central Greece'', II, 42</ref> Events during the rest of the period between 251 and 245 BC remain obscure, although it is known that Aratus served for four or five years as a cavalryman in the Achaean militia.<ref name=\"RandB6\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 6</ref>\n\n==''Strategos'' of the Achaean League==\n\n==={{anchor|Taking of the Acrocorinth}}Taking the Acrocorinth===\n\nIn 245 BC, Aratus was elected ''[[strategos]]'' of the Achaean League. He went on to hold this position every two years until his death, with only a few interruptions.{{refn|Nobody could be elected ''strategos'' in two consecutive years.<ref name=\"RandB6\"/>|group=N}} Aratus' career was marked by the expansion of the League. His first known act as ''strategos'' was to pillage the countryside of [[Locris]] and [[Calydon]]. He also led a 10,000-strong army<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 16, 1</ref> to help the [[Boeotia]]ns against the [[Aetolian League]].\n\n[[File:20100409 korinthos03.JPG|thumb|250px|The hill on which the [[Acrocorinth]] stood]]\n\nIn his second term, Aratus focused on capturing the [[Acrocorinth]], the [[acropolis]] of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]. The city of Corinth controlled entry to the [[Peloponnese]], and was an important trading post. The Acrocorinth was a formidable fortress, built on a hill nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m|0}} high. It had a freshwater source, was surrounded by cliffs, and was capped by a massive, walled citadel. Antigonus Gonatas controlled the Acrocorinth with a strong garrison under his commander [[Persaeus]]. In 243 BC, Aratus learned from Syrian mercenaries that there was a less steep access route to the hill, where the wall was also at its lowest point. By midsummer that year, Aratus was ready to attack the Acrocorinth.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 7</ref>\n\nAratus assembled his army in Sicyon. The majority waited on the road between Sicyon and the Acrocorinth, while Aratus himself went to the city with a select force of 400 men.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 21, 1</ref> Eight were sent forward to overwhelm the guards before 100 soldiers scaled the walls with ladders. Each was barefoot to minimise noise. They encountered a group of guards on entering the city, and  killed three. But a fourth escaped and raised the alarm. Aratus and his soldiers got as far as the citadel itself, attempting to scale its walls as defenders hurled projectiles down on them. In the meantime, 300 more soldiers had scaled the outer walls, but then struggled to find Aratus inside the city. The waiting Achaean army below was at risk of being trapped between the citadel's defenders and a group of Macedonian soldiers arriving from the city, but was saved by those 300 soldiers, who were able to attack and rout the Macedonians from behind. The 300 men then went back to support their commander at the citadel. Weather conditions proved favourable for Aratus:<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|(\u2026) the light of the full moon also made their arms appear more numerous to the enemy than they really were, owing to the length of their line of march, and the echoes of the night gave the impression that the shouts proceeded from many times the number there really were.|Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 22, 5}}\n\nAratus' soldiers scaled the walls of the citadel and the garrison surrendered. By dawn, the Achaeans held both citadel and city, in a victory owing partly to luck but also to good planning and nerve. The storming of the near-impregnable Acrocorinth was another major accomplishment for Aratus, following his taking of Sicyon. Very few achieved the feat; among those who did was [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes|Demetrius I, \"the Besieger\"]].<ref name=\"RandB8\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 8</ref> Aratus went on to capture [[Lechaeum]], the harbour of Corinth, and secure the 25 Macedonian warships docked there. He garrisoned the captured citadel with 400 Achaeans and 50 watchdogs.<ref name=\"RandB8\"/>\n\n===Alliance with Sparta===\n[[File:Aratus of Sicyon.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Late 17th-century print: Aratus in combat|alt=]]\n\nAfter its capture by Aratus, Corinth also joined the Achaean League. It was followed shortly afterwards by [[Megara]], [[Troezen]], and [[Epidaurus]]. The Achaean League gained more renown when [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], the new king of Egypt, was elected ''[[hegemon]]''. Both the League and rival Macedon then sought new allies. The Macedonian king Antigonus chose the [[Aetolian League]], which had ambitions of working with him to defeat the Achaean League and then share out the conquered territory. The Achaean League allied with [[Sparta]], one of the most powerful ''[[poleis]]'' of Greece.<ref name=\"RandB9\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 9</ref>\n\nIn 241 BC, during Aratus' third term as ''strategos'', the Aetolian League invaded the Peloponnese. Aratus and the Spartan king, [[Agis IV]], agreed to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] together, but disagreed on strategy. Agis IV wanted to defeat the Aetolians in a pitched battle. But Aratus wanted to avoid immediate fighting, on the grounds that the Aetolians could only cause limited damage at that time as crops had already been harvested and stored. It is unclear whether this reasoning truly reflected Aratus' thinking, or whether he regretted his alliance with Sparta. It has also been suggested that this was one of the episodes of Aratus' life in which he lost his nerve in military matters.<ref name=\"RandB9\"/>\n\nThe Spartan army returned home, ending the alliance. The impact was immediately felt. The front line could no longer be held, allowing the Aetolians to invade the Peloponnese and capture [[Pellene]], one of the first members of the Achaean League. In response, Aratus marched on the Aetolians with the soldiers he had available, finding them in disarray and routing them easily.<ref name=\"RandB9\"/>\n\nBy 240 BC it had become clear to Antigonus that the Aetolians might not be ideal allies, and he sued for peace with the Achaeans. This peace did not last. The 80-year-old king died the following year, and was succeeded by his son [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]].<ref name=\"RandB9\"/>\n\n===Expanding the League===\n====Setbacks at Argos====\n\nAfter the death of Antigonus, the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues allied with each other. The reason behind this alliance remains obscure, and the alliance itself only lasted ten years. Aratus maintained his focus on expanding the Achaean League, by \"liberating even more cities in Greece from tyranny\". Those cities Included [[Argos, Greece|Argos]], [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], and [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]. In Argos, the citizens had already had plans to rise against the tyrant, but lacked sufficient weaponry. Aratus assisted them, smuggling a shipment of weapons into the city. The shipment was intercepted and the coup failed. Aratus led an attack close to the city afterwards, but the citizens were reluctant to join him.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nAratus remained determined to liberate Argos. In 235 BC he made another attempt, and succeeded in entering the city by attacking at night. But the Argives were once again reluctant to support him, leaving the Achaeans to fight alone. Aratus was wounded in the thigh by a spear.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 27, 2</ref> He ordered a retreat, but the timing was unfortunate. The retreat emboldened the tyrant, Aristippus, who had been preparing to flee the city. Instead, he held his ground and prepared for battle.<ref name=\"RandB10\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 10</ref>\n\n[[File:Greek Phalanx.jpg|thumb|250px|A traditional Greek phalanx|alt=|left]]\n\nThe Battle of the river Xerias was a classic clash between two [[phalanx]]es. As was not uncommon in Greek warfare, the battle was decided on the wings, where the Achaeans routed the enemy flank. But Aratus, leading the other wing, was injured, and he pulled back. To the outrage of the Achaeans on the victorious wing, this allowed Aristippus to claim victory. The next day, after lining up his army again for battle, Aratus decided to retreat on seeing that the enemy had gained numerical superiority through reinforcements.<ref name=\"RandB10\"/>\n\nAratus proposed a truce, which Aristippus accepted. Despite this truce, Aratus took the city of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]], controlled by Aristippus. There, he celebrated the [[Nemean Games]], and sold into slavery every Argive found. On hearing of Aristippus' determination to win back Cleonae, Aratus, who was then near Corinth, immediately mobilised a new army, probably by levying volunteers. The Argives feared Achaean intervention and did not dare attack Cleonae, but Aratus did not want to wait longer, and decided on a ploy to lure them. He returned and entered Cleonae before the Argives reached it, then sallied forth the following morning, surprising and routing the Argive army. Aristippus was killed, together with 1,500 other soldiers. It was reported that the Achaeans lost no soldiers at all. And still the victory did not bring the desired result. Aristippus' brother [[Aristomachos of Argos|Aristomachus]] returned to Argos and appointed himself as the new tyrant.<ref name=\"RandB 11\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 11</ref>\n\n====Annexation of Megalopolis====\n\nThe city of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] was founded in 371 BC by the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] general [[Epaminondas]] as a stronghold against Sparta. Until 235 BC, its tyrant, [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades]], had tried to maintain good relationships with Macedon. That year, on becoming aware of Aratus' expansionist plans in the Peloponnese; the death of Aristippus; and events in Sparta, Lydiades decided to give up his power by joining the Achaean League. This apparently unselfish deed had important consequences, as [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] and [[Mantinea]] soon followed suit.<ref name=\"RandB 11\"/> In 236 BC, Lydiades was elected ''strategos'', the first of his three terms.{{refn|This may have been part of the agreement when Megalopolis joined the League.<ref name=\"RandB12\"/>|group=N}} The event also marked the beginning of a tradition of Megapolitan ''strategoi'' in the League, most notably [[Philopoemen]].<ref name=\"RandB12\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 12</ref>\n\nThe Achaean League became a significant power through the efforts of Aratus; a mighty confederation with an organised army financed by tax revenue, controlling all of the northern Peloponnese.<ref name=\"RandB 11\"/>\n\n===War against Demetrius===\n\nRealising that the Achaean League had become a major player in Greece with the incorporation of Megalopolis, [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]], the new king of Macedon, decided to take action. In 233 BC, he sent an army to the Peloponnese commanded by a general Bithys. They defeated the Achaeans near Phylacia, probably close to [[Tegea]], although the details of the battle are unknown. Aratus apparently succeeded in escaping the battlefield and reaching Corinth, but reports began to spread that he had been killed or taken prisoner. According to Plutarch, this news was enthusiastically received in Athens. Plutarch's tendency to exaggerate notwithstanding, it seems true that the Athenians had no great liking for Aratus despite his wish to liberate the city from Macedonian rule.<ref name=\"RandB12\"/>{{refn|An inscription indicating that Bithys was made an honourary citizen of Athens suggests that Macedon's victory over Aratus was joyfully received.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 168</ref>|group=N}}\n\nA letter was sent to Corinth saying that the Achaean troops had to leave the city. Aratus himself received the letter, but sent the couriers on their way. Plutarch also reports, confusingly, that Aratus was a prisoner on a Macedonian boat carrying him back to Corinth.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 34, 2</ref> While this information is contradictory and cannot be entirely correct,<ref name=\"RandB12\"/> the outcome was the same: Aratus organised a punitive expedition into Attica, but turned back before reaching the walls of Athens. The reasons are unclear. His army may have been defeated; or he may have returned to the Peloponnese as he knew that Bithys' army was approaching from the south on its way back to Macedon. Macedon's King Demetrius was later killed in battle against invading [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes.<ref name=\"RandB13\"/>\n\nAthens, having received reports of the king's death, decided it was now in a good position to expel the weakened Macedonian garrison. Although Aratus was sick at that time, and was not the current ''strategos'' of the Achaean League, he hurried to Athens' aid. Aratus persuaded the commander of the Macedonian garrison, Diogenes, to surrender [[Piraeus]], [[Munychia]], [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], and [[Sunium]] to Athens in exchange for 150 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]], twenty of which Aratus paid himself.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 34, 4</ref> Diogenes left Athens with his troops. For the first time since 294 BC, the city was again self-governing. Nevertheless, Athens refused the invitation to join the Achaean League.<ref name=\"RandB13\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 13</ref>\n\nAristomachus of Argos, Macedon's only remaining ally in the Peloponnese, bowed to force majeure and finally joined the Achaean League. The following year, 288 BC, he was elected ''strategos''. That the same year, the alliance between the Achaeans and the Aetolians broke, the only surprise being it had lasted ten years. After Demetrius' death, [[Antigonus III Doson]] became regent for the child-king [[Philip V of Macedon]]. He secured the northern frontier of his kingdom, and concluded a treaty with the Aetolians in about 228 BC.<ref name=\"RandB13\"/>\n\n===Cleomenean War===\n[[File:Cleomenes War detail 1.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the most important locations of the Cleomenean War (Achaean League in red)]]\n\n{{Main|Cleomenean War}}\n\n====Cleomenes gains the upper hand====\n\nIn 229 BC, [[Cleomenes III]] of Sparta took three [[Arcadia]]n cities from the Aetolian League: [[Tegea]], [[Orchomenus (Arcadia)|Orchomenus]], and [[Mantinea]]. It is unclear why the Aetolian League tolerated this move.{{refn|Polybius reports that the Aetolian League allowed the Spartans to take these cities because of their poor relationship with the Achaean League.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', 2, 42, 2</ref>|group=N}} The Achaean League did not like this development, because of the cities' strategic importance.\n\nThe [[ephor]]s urged Cleomenes also to take the ''Athenaeum'', a fortress on the road between Sparta and Arcadia. The fortress belonged both to Megalopolis and to the Achaean League. The Achaean League saw this move by Sparta as a declaration of war. Aratus, again ''strategos'', tried to organise nightly attacks to regain control of Tegea and Orchomenus, but was betrayed by his [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in both cities, who told Cleomenes of the plan.<ref name=\"RandB18\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 18</ref>\n\nThe ephors called Cleomenes back to Sparta, probably seeking to avoid all-out war.<ref name=\"RandB18\"/> It was too late. With Cleomenes absent, Aratus took [[Caphyae]]. Cleomenes was dispatched once more and took a small Arcadian settlement. In 227 BC, the Achaean army marched out with 20,000 infantry, accompanied by another 1,000 infantry under Aristomachus, to defeat Cleomenes in a pitched battle. The Spartans had only 5,000 men, but their reputation still inspired fear in other Greeks. Aratus persuaded Aristomachus to pull back, which displeased Lydiades, the former tyrant of Megalopolis. Tensions were evident within the expanded Achaean League.<ref name=\"RandB18\"/>\n\nThe following year, in 226 BC, Aratus' army was defeated near [[Battle of Mount Lycaeum|Mount Lycaeum]] in Arcadia. The circumstances of the battle are unclear, but Achaean losses were heavy. Aratus was still able to turn this incident to his advantage, as it allowed him to march in secret to Mantinea and take that city. Importantly, this opened up the route from Argos to Megalopolis. From Mantinea, Aratus marched on to besiege Orchomenus. But Cleomenes marched for Megalopolis, capturing the fortress of Leuctra, 10&nbsp;km from the city. Aratus came to the aid of the Megalopolitans, and was able to drive the Spartans back, but then failed to capitalise on his victory as the Spartans were able to fall back to a position of strength. Lydiades, furious, launched a cavalry attack on the newly organised Spartan troops, but Aratus did not follow and Lydiades was defeated and killed. The Spartans regained courage from this success, and attacked and routed the entire Achaean army.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 19</ref>\n\nThe defeat brought scorn on Aratus. An Achaean assembly voted to stop funding him. Aratus resolved to resign the office of general, but rethought and stayed on,<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 38, 1</ref> again displaying his resilience. He marched with an Achaean army to Orchomenus, there defeating a Spartan army commanded by Cleomenes' father-in-law, who was captured and then quickly ransomed.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Makedonische phalanx.png|alt=|thumb|250px|The Spartans soldiers were armed in the \"Macedonian way\" after Cleomenes' reforms.|left]]\n\nIn 226 BC, Cleomenes conquered Mantinea, Tegea and [[Pharae]]. He succeeded in luring the Achaeans into open battle in the fall of 226 BC. Details of the engagement are not known, but the reformed Spartan army, now armed in the Macedonian style, won a decisive victory. The Achaeans sued for peace, and were rejected. Aratus began negotiating an alliance between Macedon and the Achaean League, but Macedon demanded the return of the Acrocorinth in return for intervening. The Achaeans were not prepared to give up the citadel, and negotiations broke down.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nIn 225 BC, Cleomenes attacked Achaean territory again, aiming to take Aratus' home city, Sicyon. He hoped this would provoke the collapse of the entire Achaean League, as tensions within the League were already running high over Aratus' Macedonian strategy. If Sicyon fell, Aratus would no longer be part of the Achaean League. The plan to take Sicyon failed, but Cleomenes did conquer [[Pellene]], [[Pheneus]], [[Penteleum]], and later Agros. The Argives, never the most enthusiastic members of the Achaean League, decided to ally with Sparta. Many authors see in this the hand of Aristomachus, former tyrant of the city.<ref>F.W. Wallbank, 1933, pp. 96\u201397</ref> Aratus was given [[plenipotentiary]] powers to deal with the crisis. He marched to Corinth, arriving to face an angry mob: the population had heard of his intention to surrender the city and its citadel to Antigonus. Aratus only narrowly escaped. The Corinthians offered to surrender the city to Cleomenes, even while the Acrocorinth was still held by an Achaean garrison. Cleomenes marched towards Corinth, taking many other cities in [[Argolis]] on his way. After laying siege to the Acrocorinth, Cleomenes proposed a peace treaty to Aratus, who refused. The Spartan king went on to besiege Sicyon, pillaging the surrounding countryside.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n====Macedonian intervention====\n\n[[File:Isthmus of Corinth in ancient Greece.svg|thumb|250px|The Isthmus of Corinth]]\n\nShortly before the start of the siege, the Achaean council members decided to accept Macedon's war conditions after all. Aratus sent his son to Macedon as a hostage. Antigonus was ready with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian intervention, he abandoned the siege of Sicyon as fast as possible, moving to the Isthmus of Corinth, a better position from which to meet the northern threat. Aratus went to meet the Macedonian king near [[Pagae]]:<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 24</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|He had no very great confidence in Antigonus, and put no trust in the Macedonians. For he knew that his own rise to power had been a consequence of the harm he had done to them, and that he had found the first and the chief basis for his conduct of affairs in his hatred towards the former Antigonus [Gonatas]. But seeing how inexorable was the necessity laid upon him in the demands of the hour, to which those we call rulers are slaves, he went on towards the dread ordeal.|Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 43, 1-2}}\n\nBoth hard-headed realists, Aratus and Antigonus got along well despite their wariness. Plutarch reports that at one point, during a banquet, they even shared a blanket to keep warm.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 43, 5</ref>\n\nCleomenes' defensive front near the Isthmus of Corinth proved very effective. It took Antigonus a long time to overcome it, and he lost men while trying to break through near [[Lechaeum]]. Later, a delegation from Argos asked Aratus to liberate their city from the Spartans, as Cleomenes had failed to deliver on his promises. Aratus sailed to [[Epidaurus]] with 1,500 troops to attack Argos, but found that it had fallen already to an internal uprising with the help of [[Timoxenos]], then ''strategos'' of the Achaean League. Sparta was left almost undefended. Cleomenes was forced to return to Sparta as a result, and leave his defences near the Isthmus. This allowed Antigonus to enter the Peloponnese, where he occupied the Acrocorinth and put a garrison in the city.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\n====Battle of Sellasia====\n\n[[File:Battle of Sellasia initial positions.png|thumb|250px|Opposing armies in the [[Battle of Sellasia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Sellasia}}\n\nIn 224 BC, while Antigonus was liberating the occupied cities in the Peloponnese, Cleomenes was reinforcing his army. The winter of 223 BC saw Cleomenes feign a march to Tegea, but then turn for Megalopolis, where he took the city by surprise. Around a thousand citizens escaped, finding shelter in [[Messene]]. Megalopolis itself was pillaged. Aratus reportedly wept while reporting this news to the Achaean council. Antigonus recalled his troops from winter quarters, but soon realised there was insufficient time. Cleomenes, emboldened, marched on Argos, pillaging the countryside in the hope that the population would be enraged by Antigonus' lack of action. But ultimately, Cleomenes' acts served only to antagonise the inhabitants of the Peloponnese.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 28</ref>\n\nAntigonus was able to rally his army, now numbering some 27,600 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. Cleomenes occupied the pass near Sellasia, before Sparta, to stop the Macedonian king. But he was defeated at the [[Battle of Sellasia]] in July 222 BC, and fled to Egypt. Antigonus conquered Sparta, but treated the city leniently and left again some days later.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 28\u201338</ref>\n\n===Social War===\n[[File:Bust of Philip V of Macedon in Palazzo Massimo (Rome).jpg|thumb|[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], king of [[Macedon]] and Aratus' ally]]\n{{Main|Social War (220-217 BC)}}\n\nIn 221 BC, the Aetolians began pillaging the territory of [[Messenia]]. In 220 BC, the council of the Achaean League met in [[Aegium]] to discuss the city of [[Messene]]'s request for their help. Most council members did not want to attack the Aetolians, but Aratus was able to persuade them. He began to raise an army near Megalopolis, with the aim of trapping the Aetolians as they returned to their ships to sail home. But the Aetolian commander was able to evade the threat. It seemed there would be no decisive confrontation, until the Achaean commanders made a crucial mistake and Aratus sent a cavalry unit against the Aetolians:<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 42</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The Achaean commanders, when they became aware of the approach of the Aetolians, mismanaged matters to such an extent that it was impossible for anyone to have acted more stupidly.|Polybius, ''Histories'', 4, 11, 1}}\n\nThe cavalry had to fight on rough terrain, where the Aetolians were greatly superior. Aratus then abandoned his favourable position to go to his cavalry's aid. The rest of the Aetolian force seized the advantage, charging from high ground to rout the Achaeans. After the battle, the Aetolians continued pillaging, and also raided Sicyon. They returned to Aetolia via the Isthmus of Corinth, adding insult to the injury of the Achaeans' failure to protect their own.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 43</ref>\n\nAs both sides were then trying to find new allies, the Achaean League turned again to Macedon. But the new Macedonian king, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], was not keen on war with the Aetolians. Ultimately, the Achaeans did convince Philip, and [[Boeotia]], [[Acarnania]], and [[Epirus]] also joined the alliance. The Aetolians allied with Sparta and [[Elis]], and in 219 BC again invaded Achaean League territory. This invasion attempt was put down near [[Aegeira]], but it was not a decisive defeat.\n\nIn the meantime, Philip was preparing his army in Macedon. He won several victories in 218 BC, but his army mutinied and he returned to Macedon for the winter.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 44\u201354</ref> Philip was assisted by Aratus and several other advisors, of whom Apelles was the most important. Aratus had become very influential, and is considered to have been a true friend of the king. Apelles, in contrast, remained resolutely Macedonian, still wanting to incorporate Achaea into the Kingdom of Macedon. Apelles began to oppose the Achaeans in the allied army, for example by demoting several Achaean officers. He also opposed Aratus by supporting his opponent, [[Eperatus]], in the election of a new ''strategos''. He tried, and failed, to impeach Aratus by ruse. The relationship between Apelles and the Macedonian king appears to have worsened as a result, and Aratus became Philip's most important advisor. Aratus quickly gained a reputation for his skill, but this increased the other officers\u2019 envy. They began to insult him openly during their banquets, even throwing stones. The king was furious, and ordered those responsible put to death.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 48; Polybius, V, 15</ref><ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nAfter Macedon's intervention in the war, the Aetolians faced more difficulties on all fronts. They continued their pillaging, but were frequently ambushed. Ultimately they sued for peace, concluded in 217 BC.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 64</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\n[[File:LifeOfAratus.jpg|alt=|thumb|250px|Map with the most important events in Aratus' life.<br />Green star: victory<br />Red star: defeat<br />Black star: retreat]]\n\nAfter the Social War, Philip caused a civil war in Messene, and possibly kept Aratus out of the matter deliberately. Unhappy, Aratus ordered the king to suppress the unrest. Philip was angry, but taken aback at his vehemence, and accepted the rebuke.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 118</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[First Macedonian War]] between Macedon and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] had erupted. In 214 BC, the Romans defeated Philip near the town of [[Oricum]] in [[Illyria]]. The same year, Philip returned to Messene, which he attacked for reasons that remain unclear. Aratus had already given his opinion of Philip's deeds near Messene, and did so again,{{refn|Macedon gaining territory in the Peloponnese was unfavourable to the Achaean League, which wished to remain independent. The relationship between Aratus and Philip may also have worsened for personal reasons, as the king had reportedly seduced Aratus' daughter-in-law.<ref name=\"RandB120\"/>|group=N}} also refusing to support Philip's campaigns in Illyria.<ref name=\"RandB120\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 120</ref>\n\nAratus's health deteriorated rapidly during this period, and he died in 213 BC. As tensions had been high between the king and the ''strategos'', there were inevitable rumours of foul play. According to Plutarch, Philip had Aratus poisoned.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 52</ref> He reports that Aratus knew what was happening, but could only confide this information to his manservant:<ref name=\"RandB120\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|Such, my dear Cephalo, said Aratus, are the wages of royal friendship.|Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 52, 3}}\n\nAccording to modern scholarship, this dramatic version of events, fitting the ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' of the ungrateful prince, is unlikely. Philip had no interest in an unstable Achaea. Aratus remained useful, despite having asked some difficult questions of Philip in the recent past, and it is difficult to imagine Philip wanting him eliminated. Had there been substance to the rumours, much public comment on the great man's murder by the king of Macedon would be expected.<ref name=\"RandB121\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 121</ref>\n\nBy special permission of the [[Oracle of Delphi]], Aratus was the first person to be buried within the city walls of Sicyon as 'founder and saviour of the city'.<ref name=\"RandB121\"/>\n\n==Personality and reception==\n\nAratus was elected ''strategos'' of the Achaean League seventeen times. Under his leadership the Achaean League became a major player in Greece, thanks principally to his military victories rather to any great skill as a tactician. Reportedly, his nerves would get the better of him at critical moments during battle. Plutarch reports that Aratus was a great politician, but that his capacities did not extend to the battlefield, saying: \"the general of the Achaeans always had cramps in the bowels when a battle was imminent\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 29, 5</ref> But it seems Aratus was a master of the surprise attack, although details of these battles remain obscure.<ref name=RandB9/>\n\nWhat Aratus lacked as a tactician, he made up for as a politician. He was very good at compromise, as when he surrendered the hard-earned Acrocorinth to Macedon when he needed Macedon's help against Sparta. He could also display great patience. When he brought Sicyon into the Achaean League, for example, Aratus knew that he was too young to be elected ''strategos''. This did not stop him from ultimately achieving that goal.<ref name=\"RandB5\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 5</ref>\n\nAratus became the most important person within the Achaean League, but it grew progressively more difficult for him to get his way as a succession of other mighty city-states joined.<ref name=\"RandB18\"/> Although it is unlikely that Aratus was poisoned, his death was certainly linked with the final stage of Philip's transition from beloved young prince to what Plutarch described as an impious despot richly deserving of downfall.<ref name=\"RandB121\"/>\n\nAratus wrote his memoirs, now lost. Plutarch and Polybius both acknowledge using it extensively as a source. Polybius states that he is covering Aratus \"quite summarily, as he published a truthful and clearly written memoir of his career\". The information concerning Aratus is therefore to be read through a critical filter, allowing for the possibility that he may have wanted to attenuate his own mistakes by blaming others, or that he glorified his own victories.<ref name=\"RandB3\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Ancient sources===\n\n*[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'',

\u1f0c\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a3\u03b9\u03ba\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; 271\u2013213 BC) was a politician and military commander of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. He was elected [[strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]] 17 times, leading the League through numerous military campaigns including the [[Cleomenean War]] and the [[Social War (220-217 BC)|Social War]].\n\nAratus was exiled to [[Argos, Greece|Argos]] at the age of seven, after his father, the magistrate of [[Sicyon]], was killed in a coup. In 251 BC, he led an expedition composed of other exiles which freed Sicyon from tyranny, and assumed power in the city. Sicyon joined the [[Achaean League]], in which Aratus would later be elected ''[[strategos]]''. In his first major campaign as strategos, he seized the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]]-held citadel of [[Acrocorinth]], previously believed impregnable.\n\nAfter conquering the Acrocorinth, Aratus pursued the Achaean League's expansion. When the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes III]] conquered the Achaean cities of Argos and Corinth, Aratus succeeded in securing an alliance with his erstwhile enemy, Macedon. Cleomenes III was defeated at the [[Battle of Sellasia]] by the joint forces of the Achaean League and [[Antigonus III Doson]], the regent of Macedon. During the Social War against the [[Aetolian League]], Aratus became one of the prime advisors of the new king of Macedon, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]]. Aratus died in 213 BC, allegedly poisoned by Philip.\n\n==Youth==\n\n[[File:Korinth Isthmus de.png|thumb|250x250px|Location of Sicyon|alt=|left]]\n[[File:Theater Sikyon.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Sicyon's theatre, built by Aratus' father|alt=]]\n\nAratus was born in 271 BC in the northern [[Peloponnese]] [[city-state]] of [[Sicyon]]. His father, Cleinias of Sicyon, had become head magistrate of the city jointly with [[Timocleidas]] after the murder of the previous [[tyrant]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 2, 1</ref> Shortly after government stabilised, Timocleidas died. In 264 BC, [[Abantidas]] murdered Cleinias, and proclaimed himself tyrant. The seven-year-old Aratus escaped the coup with the help of his aunt{{refn|His aunt, Soso, was married to Cleinias' brother, Prophantus, and was also the sister of Abantidas.<ref name=\"RandB3\"/>|group=N}} who, in the confusion, was able to hide the boy until nightfall and then smuggle him out of Sicyon to [[Argos, Greece|Argos]]. He was raised in Argos by friends of his father, living there until 251 BC.<ref>F.W. Walbank, 1933, p. 3</ref><ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 175</ref>\n\nIn Argos, Aratus initially became known as a good athlete, winning a prize in the [[pentathlon]]. But he remained focused on the idea of freeing his home city's from tyranny. Despite his youth, he was able to gain widespread support among fellow exiles, becoming the leader of the exiles' party.<ref name=\"RandB3\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 3</ref>\n\nIn Sicyon, Abantidas was killed by two philosophers. Abantidas was replaced by his own father, who was subsequently killed and replaced by [[Nicocles (Sicyon)|Nicocles]]. Aratus began to seek support from the kings of [[Kingdom of Macedon|Macedon]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]]. [[Plutarch]] reports that Nicocles' main cause of concern about Aratus was the younger man's elevated connections.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 4, 2</ref>\n\n==Liberating Sicyon==\n\nIn 251 BC, Aratus had originally intended to take and hold a fortified post near Sicyon from which he could raid his enemies' property, and where sympathisers could join him. But a political prisoner recently escaped from the tyrant's prison in Sicyon suggested a better plan, saying that the escape route he had taken out of Sicyon could easily be used by men with ladders to get back into the city by scaling its defensive walls.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 5, 3</ref>\n\nAratus armed his men in secret. To mislead the tyrant's spies at Argos, he pretended to feast on the day of his planned coup. Once the spies had gone, Aratus joined his men waiting outside the city and led them to Sicyon, aiming to reach and scale the city walls while the light was still low. They were almost given away by the city's watchdogs, but the guards failed to recognise the danger. At dawn, the intruders took the barracks guards prisoner. The tyrant, Nicocles, managed to escape through a tunnel. Rumours of the attack spread fast across the city, and some of the citizens set fire to the tyrant's house. Aratus did not intervene to stop the looting, allowing citizens free rein after thirteen years of tyranny.<ref name=\"RandB5\"/>\n\n===Consolidating Sicyon===\n\n[[File:Antigonus Gonatas British Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Antigonus Gonatas]], king of [[Macedon]]]]\n\nAratus' first act after taking Sicyon was to call back its exiles. According to Plutarch, he recalled 80 who had been banished by Nicocles, and a further 500 besides them.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 9, 3</ref> The returning exiles sought to reclaim their confiscated property, and civil war threatened. Plutarch reports that one of the two kings Aratus had earlier petitioned for support gave him 25 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver as a personal gift and goodwill gesture. It is not clear whether this was [[Antigonus Gonatas]], king of Macedon, or [[Ptolemy II Philadelphos]], pharaoh of Egypt. Antigonus probably hoped that Aratus would prove a useful Macedonian puppet in the [[Peloponnese]]. Ptolemy had just won Corinth from the Macedonian empire, and would have liked to increase his success.<ref name=\"RandB5\"/> Aratus gave the money away to his fellow citizens and, probably also in 251 BC, decided to attach Sicyon to the [[Achaean League]]. It was the first time the League had admitted a non-[[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaean]] ''[[polis]]'' (Sicyon was [[Dorians|Dorian]]).<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\nBut Sicyon had become economically unstable. Aratus could now no longer rely for help on an alliance with Macedon's Antigonus, as the Achaean League was a rival of Macedon in Greece. He was left little choice but to turn to Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Egypt. Plutarch recounts the events of his journey to the court at Alexandria, from which he returned with 40 talents and the promise of another 110. Back in Sicyon, Aratus did not want sole responsibility for distributing the money, and established a committee which included himself and fifteen other members for the task. The funds received from Ptolemy II enabled Aratus to resolve the political problems in Sicyon. Grateful citizens erected a bronze statue to honour him.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', ''Central Greece'', II, 42</ref> Events during the rest of the period between 251 and 245 BC remain obscure, although it is known that Aratus served for four or five years as a cavalryman in the Achaean militia.<ref name=\"RandB6\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 6</ref>\n\n==''Strategos'' of the Achaean League==\n\n==={{anchor|Taking of the Acrocorinth}}Taking the Acrocorinth===\n\nIn 245 BC, Aratus was elected ''[[strategos]]'' of the Achaean League. He went on to hold this position every two years until his death, with only a few interruptions.{{refn|Nobody could be elected ''strategos'' in two consecutive years.<ref name=\"RandB6\"/>|group=N}} Aratus' career was marked by the expansion of the League. His first known act as ''strategos'' was to pillage the countryside of [[Locris]] and [[Calydon]]. He also led a 10,000-strong army<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 16, 1</ref> to help the [[Boeotia]]ns against the [[Aetolian League]].\n\n[[File:20100409 korinthos03.JPG|thumb|250px|The hill on which the [[Acrocorinth]] stood]]\n\nIn his second term, Aratus focused on capturing the [[Acrocorinth]], the [[acropolis]] of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]. The city of Corinth controlled entry to the [[Peloponnese]], and was an important trading post. The Acrocorinth was a formidable fortress, built on a hill nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m|0}} high. It had a freshwater source, was surrounded by cliffs, and was capped by a massive, walled citadel. Antigonus Gonatas controlled the Acrocorinth with a strong garrison under his commander [[Persaeus]]. In 243 BC, Aratus learned from Syrian mercenaries that there was a less steep access route to the hill, where the wall was also at its lowest point. By midsummer that year, Aratus was ready to attack the Acrocorinth.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 7</ref>\n\nAratus assembled his army in Sicyon. The majority waited on the road between Sicyon and the Acrocorinth, while Aratus himself went to the city with a select force of 400 men.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 21, 1</ref> Eight were sent forward to overwhelm the guards before 100 soldiers scaled the walls with ladders. Each was barefoot to minimize noise. They encountered a group of guards on entering the city, and  killed three. But a fourth escaped and raised the alarm. Aratus and his soldiers got as far as the citadel itself, attempting to scale its walls as defenders hurled projectiles down on them. In the meantime, 300 more soldiers had scaled the outer walls, but then struggled to find Aratus inside the city. The waiting Achaean army below was at risk of being trapped between the citadel's defenders and a group of Macedonian soldiers arriving from the city, but was saved by those 300 soldiers, who were able to attack and rout the Macedonians from behind. The 300 men then went back to support their commander at the citadel. Weather conditions proved favourable for Aratus:<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|(\u2026) the light of the full moon also made their arms appear more numerous to the enemy than they really were, owing to the length of their line of march, and the echoes of the night gave the impression that the shouts proceeded from many times the number there really were.|Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 22, 5}}\n\nAratus' soldiers scaled the walls of the citadel and the garrison surrendered. By dawn, the Achaeans held both citadel and city, in a victory owing partly to luck but also to good planning and nerve. The storming of the near-impregnable Acrocorinth was another major accomplishment for Aratus, following his taking of Sicyon. Very few achieved the feat; among those who did was [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes|Demetrius I, \"the Besieger\"]].<ref name=\"RandB8\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 8</ref> Aratus went on to capture [[Lechaeum]], the harbour of Corinth, and secure the 25 Macedonian warships docked there. He garrisoned the captured citadel with 400 Achaeans and 50 watchdogs.<ref name=\"RandB8\"/>\n\n===Alliance with Sparta===\n[[File:Aratus of Sicyon.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Late 17th-century print: Aratus in combat|alt=]]\n\nAfter its capture by Aratus, Corinth also joined the Achaean League. It was followed shortly afterwards by [[Megara]], [[Troezen]], and [[Epidaurus]]. The Achaean League gained more renown when [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], the new king of Egypt, was elected ''[[hegemon]]''. Both the League and rival Macedon then sought new allies. The Macedonian king Antigonus chose the [[Aetolian League]], which had ambitions of working with him to defeat the Achaean League and then share out the conquered territory. The Achaean League allied with [[Sparta]], one of the most powerful ''[[poleis]]'' of Greece.<ref name=\"RandB9\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 9</ref>\n\nIn 241 BC, during Aratus' third term as ''strategos'', the Aetolian League invaded the Peloponnese. Aratus and the Spartan king, [[Agis IV]], agreed to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] together, but disagreed on strategy. Agis IV wanted to defeat the Aetolians in a pitched battle. But Aratus wanted to avoid immediate fighting, on the grounds that the Aetolians could only cause limited damage at that time as crops had already been harvested and stored. It is unclear whether this reasoning truly reflected Aratus' thinking, or whether he regretted his alliance with Sparta. It has also been suggested that this was one of the episodes of Aratus' life in which he lost his nerve in military matters.<ref name=\"RandB9\"/>\n\nThe Spartan army returned home, ending the alliance. The impact was immediately felt. The front line could no longer be held, allowing the Aetolians to invade the Peloponnese and capture [[Pellene]], one of the first members of the Achaean League. In response, Aratus marched on the Aetolians with the soldiers he had available, finding them in disarray and routing them easily.<ref name=\"RandB9\"/>\n\nBy 240 BC it had become clear to Antigonus that the Aetolians might not be ideal allies, and he sued for peace with the Achaeans. This peace did not last. The 80-year-old king died the following year, and was succeeded by his son [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]].<ref name=\"RandB9\"/>\n\n===Expanding the League===\n====Setbacks at Argos====\n\nAfter the death of Antigonus, the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues allied with each other. The reason behind this alliance remains obscure, and the alliance itself only lasted ten years. Aratus maintained his focus on expanding the Achaean League, by \"liberating even more cities in Greece from tyranny\". Those cities Included [[Argos, Greece|Argos]], [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], and [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]. In Argos, the citizens had already had plans to rise against the tyrant, but lacked sufficient weaponry. Aratus assisted them, smuggling a shipment of weapons into the city. The shipment was intercepted and the coup failed. Aratus led an attack close to the city afterwards, but the citizens were reluctant to join him.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nAratus remained determined to liberate Argos. In 235 BC he made another attempt, and succeeded in entering the city by attacking at night. But the Argives were once again reluctant to support him, leaving the Achaeans to fight alone. Aratus was wounded in the thigh by a spear.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 27, 2</ref> He ordered a retreat, but the timing was unfortunate. The retreat emboldened the tyrant, Aristippus, who had been preparing to flee the city. Instead, he held his ground and prepared for battle.<ref name=\"RandB10\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 10</ref>\n\n[[File:Greek Phalanx.jpg|thumb|250px|A traditional Greek phalanx|alt=|left]]\n\nThe Battle of the river Xerias was a classic clash between two [[phalanx]]es. As was not uncommon in Greek warfare, the battle was decided on the wings, where the Achaeans routed the enemy flank. But Aratus, leading the other wing, was injured, and he pulled back. To the outrage of the Achaeans on the victorious wing, this allowed Aristippus to claim victory. The next day, after lining up his army again for battle, Aratus decided to retreat on seeing that the enemy had gained numerical superiority through reinforcements.<ref name=\"RandB10\"/>\n\nAratus proposed a truce, which Aristippus accepted. Despite this truce, Aratus took the city of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]], controlled by Aristippus. There, he celebrated the [[Nemean Games]], and sold into slavery every Argive found. On hearing of Aristippus' determination to win back Cleonae, Aratus, who was then near Corinth, immediately mobilised a new army, probably by levying volunteers. The Argives feared Achaean intervention and did not dare attack Cleonae, but Aratus did not want to wait longer, and decided on a ploy to lure them. He returned and entered Cleonae before the Argives reached it, then sallied forth the following morning, surprising and routing the Argive army. Aristippus was killed, together with 1,500 other soldiers. It was reported that the Achaeans lost no soldiers at all. And still the victory did not bring the desired result. Aristippus' brother [[Aristomachos of Argos|Aristomachus]] returned to Argos and appointed himself as the new tyrant.<ref name=\"RandB 11\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 11</ref>\n\n====Annexation of Megalopolis====\n\nThe city of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] was founded in 371 BC by the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] general [[Epaminondas]] as a stronghold against Sparta. Until 235 BC, its tyrant, [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades]], had tried to maintain good relationships with Macedon. That year, on becoming aware of Aratus' expansionist plans in the Peloponnese; the death of Aristippus; and events in Sparta, Lydiades decided to give up his power by joining the Achaean League. This apparently unselfish deed had important consequences, as [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] and [[Mantinea]] soon followed suit.<ref name=\"RandB 11\"/> In 236 BC, Lydiades was elected ''strategos'', the first of his three terms.{{refn|This may have been part of the agreement when Megalopolis joined the League.<ref name=\"RandB12\"/>|group=N}} The event also marked the beginning of a tradition of Megapolitan ''strategoi'' in the League, most notably [[Philopoemen]].<ref name=\"RandB12\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 12</ref>\n\nThe Achaean League became a significant power through the efforts of Aratus; a mighty confederation with an organised army financed by tax revenue, controlling all of the northern Peloponnese.<ref name=\"RandB 11\"/>\n\n===War against Demetrius===\n\nRealising that the Achaean League had become a major player in Greece with the incorporation of Megalopolis, [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]], the new king of Macedon, decided to take action. In 233 BC, he sent an army to the Peloponnese commanded by a general Bithys. They defeated the Achaeans near Phylacia, probably close to [[Tegea]], although the details of the battle are unknown. Aratus apparently succeeded in escaping the battlefield and reaching Corinth, but reports began to spread that he had been killed or taken prisoner. According to Plutarch, this news was enthusiastically received in Athens. Plutarch's tendency to exaggerate notwithstanding, it seems true that the Athenians had no great liking for Aratus despite his wish to liberate the city from Macedonian rule.<ref name=\"RandB12\"/>{{refn|An inscription indicating that Bithys was made an honourary citizen of Athens suggests that Macedon's victory over Aratus was joyfully received.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 168</ref>|group=N}}\n\nA letter was sent to Corinth saying that the Achaean troops had to leave the city. Aratus himself received the letter, but sent the couriers on their way. Plutarch also reports, confusingly, that Aratus was a prisoner on a Macedonian boat carrying him back to Corinth.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 34, 2</ref> While this information is contradictory and cannot be entirely correct,<ref name=\"RandB12\"/> the outcome was the same: Aratus organised a punitive expedition into Attica, but turned back before reaching the walls of Athens. The reasons are unclear. His army may have been defeated; or he may have returned to the Peloponnese as he knew that Bithys' army was approaching from the south on its way back to Macedon. Macedon's King Demetrius was later killed in battle against invading [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes.<ref name=\"RandB13\"/>\n\nAthens, having received reports of the king's death, decided it was now in a good position to expel the weakened Macedonian garrison. Although Aratus was sick at that time, and was not the current ''strategos'' of the Achaean League, he hurried to Athens' aid. Aratus persuaded the commander of the Macedonian garrison, Diogenes, to surrender [[Piraeus]], [[Munychia]], [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], and [[Sunium]] to Athens in exchange for 150 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]], twenty of which Aratus paid himself.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 34, 4</ref> Diogenes left Athens with his troops. For the first time since 294 BC, the city was again self-governing. Nevertheless, Athens refused the invitation to join the Achaean League.<ref name=\"RandB13\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 13</ref>\n\nAristomachus of Argos, Macedon's only remaining ally in the Peloponnese, bowed to force majeure and finally joined the Achaean League. The following year, 288 BC, he was elected ''strategos''. That the same year, the alliance between the Achaeans and the Aetolians broke, the only surprise being it had lasted ten years. After Demetrius' death, [[Antigonus III Doson]] became regent for the child-king [[Philip V of Macedon]]. He secured the northern frontier of his kingdom, and concluded a treaty with the Aetolians in about 228 BC.<ref name=\"RandB13\"/>\n\n===Cleomenean War===\n[[File:Cleomenes War detail 1.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the most important locations of the Cleomenean War (Achaean League in red)]]\n\n{{Main|Cleomenean War}}\n\n====Cleomenes gains the upper hand====\n\nIn 229 BC, [[Cleomenes III]] of Sparta took three [[Arcadia]]n cities from the Aetolian League: [[Tegea]], [[Orchomenus (Arcadia)|Orchomenus]], and [[Mantinea]]. It is unclear why the Aetolian League tolerated this move.{{refn|Polybius reports that the Aetolian League allowed the Spartans to take these cities because of their poor relationship with the Achaean League.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', 2, 42, 2</ref>|group=N}} The Achaean League did not like this development, because of the cities' strategic importance.\n\nThe [[ephor]]s urged Cleomenes also to take the ''Athenaeum'', a fortress on the road between Sparta and Arcadia. The fortress belonged both to Megalopolis and to the Achaean League. The Achaean League saw this move by Sparta as a declaration of war. Aratus, again ''strategos'', tried to organise nightly attacks to regain control of Tegea and Orchomenus, but was betrayed by his [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in both cities, who told Cleomenes of the plan.<ref name=\"RandB18\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 18</ref>\n\nThe ephors called Cleomenes back to Sparta, probably seeking to avoid all-out war.<ref name=\"RandB18\"/> It was too late. With Cleomenes absent, Aratus took [[Caphyae]]. Cleomenes was dispatched once more and took a small Arcadian settlement. In 227 BC, the Achaean army marched out with 20,000 infantry, accompanied by another 1,000 infantry under Aristomachus, to defeat Cleomenes in a pitched battle. The Spartans had only 5,000 men, but their reputation still inspired fear in other Greeks. Aratus persuaded Aristomachus to pull back, which displeased Lydiades, the former tyrant of Megalopolis. Tensions were evident within the expanded Achaean League.<ref name=\"RandB18\"/>\n\nThe following year, in 226 BC, Aratus' army was defeated near [[Battle of Mount Lycaeum|Mount Lycaeum]] in Arcadia. The circumstances of the battle are unclear, but Achaean losses were heavy. Aratus was still able to turn this incident to his advantage, as it allowed him to march in secret to Mantinea and take that city. Importantly, this opened up the route from Argos to Megalopolis. From Mantinea, Aratus marched on to besiege Orchomenus. But Cleomenes marched for Megalopolis, capturing the fortress of Leuctra, 10&nbsp;km from the city. Aratus came to the aid of the Megalopolitans, and was able to drive the Spartans back, but then failed to capitalize on his victory as the Spartans were able to fall back to a position of strength. Lydiades, furious, launched a cavalry attack on the newly organised Spartan troops, but Aratus did not follow and Lydiades was defeated and killed. The Spartans regained courage from this success, and attacked and routed the entire Achaean army.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 19</ref>\n\nThe defeat brought scorn on Aratus. An Achaean assembly voted to stop funding him. Aratus resolved to resign the office of general, but rethought and stayed on,<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 38, 1</ref> again displaying his resilience. He marched with an Achaean army to Orchomenus, there defeating a Spartan army commanded by Cleomenes' father-in-law, who was captured and then quickly ransomed.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Makedonische phalanx.png|alt=|thumb|250px|The Spartans soldiers were armed in the \"Macedonian way\" after Cleomenes' reforms.|left]]\n\nIn 226 BC, Cleomenes conquered Mantinea, Tegea and [[Pharae]]. He succeeded in luring the Achaeans into open battle in the fall of 226 BC. Details of the engagement are not known, but the reformed Spartan army, now armed in the Macedonian style, won a decisive victory. The Achaeans sued for peace, and were rejected. Aratus began negotiating an alliance between Macedon and the Achaean League, but Macedon demanded the return of the Acrocorinth in return for intervening. The Achaeans were not prepared to give up the citadel, and negotiations broke down.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nIn 225 BC, Cleomenes attacked Achaean territory again, aiming to take Aratus' home city, Sicyon. He hoped this would provoke the collapse of the entire Achaean League, as tensions within the League were already running high over Aratus' Macedonian strategy. If Sicyon fell, Aratus would no longer be part of the Achaean League. The plan to take Sicyon failed, but Cleomenes did conquer [[Pellene]], [[Pheneus]], [[Penteleum]], and later Agros. The Argives, never the most enthusiastic members of the Achaean League, decided to ally with Sparta. Many authors see in this the hand of Aristomachus, former tyrant of the city.<ref>F.W. Wallbank, 1933, pp. 96\u201397</ref> Aratus was given [[plenipotentiary]] powers to deal with the crisis. He marched to Corinth, arriving to face an angry mob: the population had heard of his intention to surrender the city and its citadel to Antigonus. Aratus only narrowly escaped. The Corinthians offered to surrender the city to Cleomenes, even while the Acrocorinth was still held by an Achaean garrison. Cleomenes marched towards Corinth, taking many other cities in [[Argolis]] on his way. After laying siege to the Acrocorinth, Cleomenes proposed a peace treaty to Aratus, who refused. The Spartan king went on to besiege Sicyon, pillaging the surrounding countryside.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n====Macedonian intervention====\n\n[[File:Isthmus of Corinth in ancient Greece.svg|thumb|250px|The Isthmus of Corinth]]\n\nShortly before the start of the siege, the Achaean council members decided to accept Macedon's war conditions after all. Aratus sent his son to Macedon as a hostage. Antigonus was ready with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian intervention, he abandoned the siege of Sicyon as fast as possible, moving to the Isthmus of Corinth, a better position from which to meet the northern threat. Aratus went to meet the Macedonian king near [[Pagae]]:<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 24</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|He had no very great confidence in Antigonus, and put no trust in the Macedonians. For he knew that his own rise to power had been a consequence of the harm he had done to them, and that he had found the first and the chief basis for his conduct of affairs in his hatred towards the former Antigonus [Gonatas]. But seeing how inexorable was the necessity laid upon him in the demands of the hour, to which those we call rulers are slaves, he went on towards the dread ordeal.|Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 43, 1-2}}\n\nBoth hard-headed realists, Aratus and Antigonus got along well despite their wariness. Plutarch reports that at one point, during a banquet, they even shared a blanket to keep warm.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 43, 5</ref>\n\nCleomenes' defensive front near the Isthmus of Corinth proved very effective. It took Antigonus a long time to overcome it, and he lost men while trying to break through near [[Lechaeum]]. Later, a delegation from Argos asked Aratus to liberate their city from the Spartans, as Cleomenes had failed to deliver on his promises. Aratus sailed to [[Epidaurus]] with 1,500 troops to attack Argos, but found that it had fallen already to an internal uprising with the help of [[Timoxenos]], then ''strategos'' of the Achaean League. Sparta was left almost undefended. Cleomenes was forced to return to Sparta as a result, and leave his defences near the Isthmus. This allowed Antigonus to enter the Peloponnese, where he occupied the Acrocorinth and put a garrison in the city.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\n====Battle of Sellasia====\n\n[[File:Battle of Sellasia initial positions.png|thumb|250px|Opposing armies in the [[Battle of Sellasia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Sellasia}}\n\nIn 224 BC, while Antigonus was liberating the occupied cities in the Peloponnese, Cleomenes was reinforcing his army. The winter of 223 BC saw Cleomenes feign a march to Tegea, but then turn for Megalopolis, where he took the city by surprise. Around a thousand citizens escaped, finding shelter in [[Messene]]. Megalopolis itself was pillaged. Aratus reportedly wept while reporting this news to the Achaean council. Antigonus recalled his troops from winter quarters, but soon realised there was insufficient time. Cleomenes, emboldened, marched on Argos, pillaging the countryside in the hope that the population would be enraged by Antigonus' lack of action. But ultimately, Cleomenes' acts served only to antagonize the inhabitants of the Peloponnese.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 28</ref>\n\nAntigonus was able to rally his army, now numbering some 27,600 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. Cleomenes occupied the pass near Sellasia, before Sparta, to stop the Macedonian king. But he was defeated at the [[Battle of Sellasia]] in July 222 BC, and fled to Egypt. Antigonus conquered Sparta, but treated the city leniently and left again some days later.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 28\u201338</ref>\n\n===Social War===\n[[File:Bust of Philip V of Macedon in Palazzo Massimo (Rome).jpg|thumb|[[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], king of [[Macedon]] and Aratus' ally]]\n{{Main|Social War (220-217 BC)}}\n\nIn 221 BC, the Aetolians began pillaging the territory of [[Messenia]]. In 220 BC, the council of the Achaean League met in [[Aegium]] to discuss the city of [[Messene]]'s request for their help. Most council members did not want to attack the Aetolians, but Aratus was able to persuade them. He began to raise an army near Megalopolis, with the aim of trapping the Aetolians as they returned to their ships to sail home. But the Aetolian commander was able to evade the threat. It seemed there would be no decisive confrontation, until the Achaean commanders made a crucial mistake and Aratus sent a cavalry unit against the Aetolians:<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 42</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The Achaean commanders, when they became aware of the approach of the Aetolians, mismanaged matters to such an extent that it was impossible for anyone to have acted more stupidly.|Polybius, ''Histories'', 4, 11, 1}}\n\nThe cavalry had to fight on rough terrain, where the Aetolians were greatly superior. Aratus then abandoned his favourable position to go to his cavalry's aid. The rest of the Aetolian force seized the advantage, charging from high ground to rout the Achaeans. After the battle, the Aetolians continued pillaging, and also raided Sicyon. They returned to Aetolia via the Isthmus of Corinth, adding insult to the injury of the Achaeans' failure to protect their own.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 43</ref>\n\nAs both sides were then trying to find new allies, the Achaean League turned again to Macedon. But the new Macedonian king, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], was not keen on war with the Aetolians. Ultimately, the Achaeans did convince Philip, and [[Boeotia]], [[Acarnania]], and [[Epirus]] also joined the alliance. The Aetolians allied with Sparta and [[Elis]], and in 219 BC again invaded Achaean League territory. This invasion attempt was put down near [[Aegeira]], but it was not a decisive defeat.\n\nIn the meantime, Philip was preparing his army in Macedon. He won several victories in 218 BC, but his army mutinied and he returned to Macedon for the winter.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 44\u201354</ref> Philip was assisted by Aratus and several other advisors, of whom Apelles was the most important. Aratus had become very influential, and is considered to have been a true friend of the king. Apelles, in contrast, remained resolutely Macedonian, still wanting to incorporate Achaea into the Kingdom of Macedon. Apelles began to oppose the Achaeans in the allied army, for example by demoting several Achaean officers. He also opposed Aratus by supporting his opponent, [[Eperatus]], in the election of a new ''strategos''. He tried, and failed, to impeach Aratus by ruse. The relationship between Apelles and the Macedonian king appears to have worsened as a result, and Aratus became Philip's most important advisor. Aratus quickly gained a reputation for his skill, but this increased the other officers\u2019 envy. They began to insult him openly during their banquets, even throwing stones. The king was furious, and ordered those responsible put to death.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 48; Polybius, V, 15</ref><ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nAfter Macedon's intervention in the war, the Aetolians faced more difficulties on all fronts. They continued their pillaging, but were frequently ambushed. Ultimately they sued for peace, concluded in 217 BC.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 64</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\n[[File:LifeOfAratus.jpg|alt=|thumb|250px|Map with the most important events in Aratus' life.<br />Green star: victory<br />Red star: defeat<br />Black star: retreat]]\n\nAfter the Social War, Philip caused a civil war in Messene, and possibly kept Aratus out of the matter deliberately. Unhappy, Aratus ordered the king to suppress the unrest. Philip was angry, but taken aback at his vehemence, and accepted the rebuke.<ref>Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 118</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[First Macedonian War]] between Macedon and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] had erupted. In 214 BC, the Romans defeated Philip near the town of [[Oricum]] in [[Illyria]]. The same year, Philip returned to Messene, which he attacked for reasons that remain unclear. Aratus had already given his opinion of Philip's deeds near Messene, and did so again,{{refn|Macedon gaining territory in the Peloponnese was unfavourable to the Achaean League, which wished to remain independent. The relationship between Aratus and Philip may also have worsened for personal reasons, as the king had reportedly seduced Aratus' daughter-in-law.<ref name=\"RandB120\"/>|group=N}} also refusing to support Philip's campaigns in Illyria.<ref name=\"RandB120\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 120</ref>\n\nAratus's health deteriorated rapidly during this period, and he died in 213 BC. As tensions had been high between the king and the ''strategos'', there were inevitable rumours of foul play. According to Plutarch, Philip had Aratus poisoned.<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 52</ref> He reports that Aratus knew what was happening, but could only confide this information to his manservant:<ref name=\"RandB120\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|Such, my dear Cephalo, said Aratus, are the wages of royal friendship.|Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Aratus'', 52, 3}}\n\nAccording to modern scholarship, this dramatic version of events, fitting the ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' of the ungrateful prince, is unlikely. Philip had no interest in an unstable Achaea. Aratus remained useful, despite having asked some difficult questions of Philip in the recent past, and it is difficult to imagine Philip wanting him eliminated. Had there been substance to the rumours, much public comment on the great man's murder by the king of Macedon would be expected.<ref name=\"RandB121\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 121</ref>\n\nBy special permission of the [[Oracle of Delphi]], Aratus was the first person to be buried within the city walls of Sicyon as 'founder and saviour of the city'.<ref name=\"RandB121\"/>\n\n==Personality and reception==\n\nAratus was elected ''strategos'' of the Achaean League seventeen times. Under his leadership the Achaean League became a major player in Greece, thanks principally to his military victories rather to any great skill as a tactician. Reportedly, his nerves would get the better of him at critical moments during battle. Plutarch reports that Aratus was a great politician, but that his capacities did not extend to the battlefield, saying: \"the general of the Achaeans always had cramps in the bowels when a battle was imminent\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Aratus'', 29, 5</ref> But it seems Aratus was a master of the surprise attack, although details of these battles remain obscure.<ref name=RandB9/>\n\nWhat Aratus lacked as a tactician, he made up for as a politician. He was very good at compromise, as when he surrendered the hard-earned Acrocorinth to Macedon when he needed Macedon's help against Sparta. He could also display great patience. When he brought Sicyon into the Achaean League, for example, Aratus knew that he was too young to be elected ''strategos''. This did not stop him from ultimately achieving that goal.<ref name=\"RandB5\">Roberts & Bennett, 2012, p. 5</ref>\n\nAratus became the most important person within the Achaean League, but it grew progressively more difficult for him to get his way as a succession of other mighty city-states joined.<ref name=\"RandB18\"/> Although it is unlikely that Aratus was poisoned, his death was certainly linked with the final stage of Philip's transition from beloved young prince to what Plutarch described as an impious despot richly deserving of downfall.<ref name=\"RandB121\"/>\n\nAratus wrote his memoirs, now lost. Plutarch and Polybius both acknowledge using it extensively as a source. Polybius states that he is covering Aratus \"quite summarily, as he published a truthful and clearly written memoir of his career\". The information concerning Aratus is therefore to be read through a critical filter, allowing for the possibility that he may have wanted to attenuate his own mistakes by blaming others, or that he glorified his own victories.<ref name=\"RandB3\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Ancient sources===\n\n*[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', ''Life of Aratus''\n*[[Polybius]], ''Histories''\n\n===Literature===\n\n*{{Cite book|title=Twilight of the Hellenistic World|first1=Mike|first2=Bob|last1=Roberts|last2=Bennett|first=|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2012|isbn=9781848841369|location=South Yorkshire}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Aratos of Sicyon|last=Walbank|first=Frank William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1933|isbn=9780598834324|location=Cambridge}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Margos]]|after=[[Dioedas]]?|years=245\u2013244 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Dioedas]]?|after=[[Aegialeas]]|years=243\u2013242 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Aegialeas]]|after=?|years=241\u2013240 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= ?|after=?|years=239\u2013238 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= ?|after=[[Dioedas]]?|years=237\u2013236 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Dioedas]]?|after=[[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades of Megalopolis]]|years=235\u2013234 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades of Megalopolis]]|after=[[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades of Megalopolis]]|years=233\u2013232 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades of Megalopolis]]|after=[[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades of Megalopolis]]|years=231\u2013230 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis|Lydiades of Megalopolis]]|after=[[Aristomachos of Argos|Aristomachus of Argos]]|years=229\u2013228 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Aristomachos of Argos|Aristomachus of Argos]]|after=[[Hyperuatas]]|years=227\u2013226 BC }}\n{{s-vac|reason=ad hoc position}}\n\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Strategos autokrator]] of the [[Achaean League]]|years=225\u2013222 BC }}\n{{s-vac|reason=ad hoc position}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Timoxenos]]|after=[[Timoxenos]]?|years=224\u2013223 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Timoxenos]]?|after=[[Timoxenos]]|years=222\u2013221 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Timoxenos]]|after=[[Aratus the Younger]]|years=220\u2013219 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Epiratos]]|after=[[Timoxenos]]|years=217\u2013216 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= [[Timoxenos]]|after=?|years=215\u2013214 BC }}\n{{succession box|title=[[Strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]|before= ?|after=[[Cycliadas]]?|years=213 BC }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aratus of Sicyon}}\n[[Category:271 BC births]]\n[[Category:213 BC deaths]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek rulers]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek statesmen]]\n[[Category:Ancient Sicyonians]]\n[[Category:3rd-century BC Greek people]]\n[[Category:Deaths by poisoning]]\n[[Category:Achaean League]]\n[[Category:Ancient Olympic competitors]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek chariot racers]]\n", "name_user": "HaEr48", "label": "safe", "comment": "make English variation consistent (author mentioned British is preferred)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratus_of_Sicyon"}

The name McCormick-Goodhart represented the linking of one of [[Chicago]]'s oldest families, that of [[Cyrus McCormick]], with that of British [[barrister]] Frederick E. McCormick-Goodhart.  Frederick's wife Henrietta (Nettie) was the daughter of [[Leander J.

The last major section would be developed in 1963.  Because of the wartime and immediate postwar demand for housing, the {{convert|540|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate was quickly developed for low-rise apartment homes, semi-detached, and single family homes.  Starting in 1949, a 1,542 garden apartment complex, Langley Park Apartments, now located along 14th Avenue, was built to house the exploding postwar population.<ref>\"4000 Apartment Units Planned,\" ''The Washington Post'', Feb 6, 1949, p.

It had been acquired in 1947 from the McCormick-Goodhart family by the [[Eudists|Eudist Order]] for use as a seminary.  The property was acquired for $900,000 by developers, who built the 400-unit Willowbrook Apartments on the site and opened them the following year.<ref>\"McCormick-Goodhart Tract Sold for Apartment Complex,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Aug 17, 1963, p.

In addition, Asian and African immigrants from places like [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Nigeria]] settled into the area. It proved to be an attractive locale for immigrants due to the availability of affordable housing that could also accommodate families. The integration of these new groups into Langley Park reflected a larger trend of increased migration to the Greater Washington area during the 1980s and 1990s. By 1990, the area was 40 percent Hispanic.<ref name=Naughton>\"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/08/19/hispanics-carve-niche-in-pg/98a4c030-736a-4e97-bf31-a46c6d5837e8/ Hispanics Carve Niche in P.G.],\" by Jim Naughton, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 19, 1991, p.

The apartment complexes experienced substantial turnover in occupancy. Residents in the 14th Avenue and Kanawha Street area in particular were subjected to \"open air drug markets\" and other criminal activity. Long-time residents and the new immigrant communities were both victims of crime. Some homeowners organized to address neighborhood concerns about rising crime. For the 1988\u201389 school year, bus service for children who lived in walking distance to school was implemented to ensure their safety. Police also increased their presence in the community. Apartment complexes, under new management, initiated safety measures to discourage drug activity such as installing new lighting, security doors and maintaining general upkeep of their properties. At the same time, police in Prince George's County conducted multiple raids in an effort to shut down drug activity in the county.  By 1991, officials were taking note of an increase in illegal immigrants from Central America, and day laborers were beginning to become a common sight on area streets.<ref name=Naughton/>\n\n==Economy==\nLangley Park is probably best known as a center of commercial activity in northwestern Prince George's County. At each of the two corners of the New Hampshire Avenue / University Boulevard intersection is a large strip shopping center. One is known as the Langley Park Plaza (northeast corner), while the other is known as the Langley Park Shopping Center (northwest corner). There are also three other small shopping centers a few blocks east of New Hampshire Avenue, two are located on the northeast and northwest sides of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, while the third one is located at the intersection of University Boulevard and 15th Avenue.\n\n* '''Langley Park Plaza''' is the main shopping center that serves the Langley Park neighborhood. It was once the second largest strip mall in Maryland. Plans were originally announced in 1951 for development of the {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} site to include 40 stores and a six- to eight-story office building. The site remained undeveloped until 1954, when the Washington, D.C.-based department store [[Lansburgh's]] announced plans to open a three-story, {{convert|126750|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $2 million store.  It was the first major department store opened in Prince George's County.<ref>\"Lansburgh's Soon to Build a New Store,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Nov 21, 1954, p. M1.</ref>  Through the demise of the Lansburgh's chain in 1973, it would remain its most profitable store.  At the store's opening in October 1955, in addition to substantial displays and a payroll of 350, it contained the \"Hampshire Room\" &mdash; a luncheonette seating 90 and a community room to hold about 200.<ref>\"Lansburgh's New Store Opens,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Oct 18, 1955, p. 17.</ref><ref>\"Lansburgh's Prince George's County's First Department Store,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Oct 23, 1955, p.

A Value Village Thrift store has occupied its former space in Lewisdale ever since [[Toys \"R\" Us]] closed there and moved to the Langley Park Plaza. Eventually when [[Toys \"R\" Us]] closed its store in the Langley Park Plaza, its spot remained vacant for a little over 2 years, until a Regency Furniture store opened in late June/ July 2009.  [https://www.regencyfurniture.com Regency Furniture] has been operating and still continues to operate in that spot inside Langley Park Plaza today. The [[Giant-Landover|Giant Food]] store closed around early 1998, right before Dutch-Based Royal Ahold Grocery Holdings Company was getting ready to buy the Giant supermarket chain.

Even though Atlantic Supermarket does not have a deli, the deli sign still remains. Many of the store sections from the former Giant Food Store, such as the fresh seafood counter, hot meal counter, snack aisle, cereal aisle, milk aisle, and typical frozen eggs, beverage, and yogurt aisle, still remain in operation by Atlantic Supermarket. The store front/ cashier section of the store and produce section were added by Atlantic Supermarket, as the former Giant did not have these sections when it operated.<ref name=\"Supermarket_fan\"/> Additionally, the Hispanic mural on top of the ceiling by the cash registers, was added by Atlantic Supermarket. The former Giant Food Store did not originally have this mural. The rest of the picture signs of each of the grocery aisles, do however remain from the former Giant Food Store. The old-fashioned Winn-Dixie style aisle markers are also from the Giant Food Store. The Atlantic Supermarket store initially started off as being a compact supermarket with a much simpler store sign, a white rectangle frame with a red rectangle in between and the words, \"Atlantic Supermarket\", in white print. The front store sign changed supposedly when Atlantic decided to do major expansion to its supermarket in the middle of 2005. The front store sign ended up being changed to a somewhat more modernized white, castle-like triangular sign with the words, \"Atlantic Supermarket International Foods\", in a reddish, lavender type of color. Atlantic Supermarket added a unique light blue circle in the center of its store sign. The supermarket also changed the former white rectangular border it originally had, to being light blue. The expansion reportedly took over part of the parking lot and displaced twelve parking spaces that used to available in the plaza. This step by Atlantic Supermarket has only contributed to making the parking lot much smaller than it used to be. This was in part due to the fact that the [[McDonald's]] Fast Food Restaurant, which opened right outside the Langley Park Plaza in 1998, was already occupying quite a few former parking spaces of the huge parking lot. In addition to carrying classic American groceries found in many supermarket chains across America, they also offer a special selection of Latin-American, Asian, African, and Caribbean foods not formerly offered by the Giant Food Store.<ref name=\"Supermarket_fan\"/> Atlantic Supermarket offers a much broader section of fresh fruits and vegetables than traditional American supermarkets, as well. Also, the [[Peoples Drug]] store was converted into a [[CVS Pharmacy]] store when CVS corporation bought the 490-store [[Peoples Drug]] chain in the mid-nineties. The old-fashioned University Liquor store that has been inside the Langley Park Plaza for roughly five decades, is still operating in the Langley Park Plaza today. Also operating in the plaza today are Rainbow Clothing, New York Factory Outlet, Dollar Store, Jewelry Store, Family Furniture Discount Store, and At&t retailer store. The At&t retailer shop was added to the Langley Park Plaza in 2015. Prior to 2015, the spot At&t is currently operating in, has not been occupied.\n* In recent years, the Langley Park Plaza has become a shopping destination for many recent immigrants, especially those from [[Central America]]. An attraction in the Langley Park Plaza is a fountain, nestled in a section of the mall, where recent immigrants take photos to show their families and friends at home that they have arrived in the United States.<ref>\"Immigrants Give Md. Fountain a Global Reach,\" by Allison Klein, ''The Washington Post'', May 22, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/09/ST2008060900748.html \"A Stream From Ipala,\" by David Montgomery, ''The Washington Post'', June 9, 2008 p. C1 (retrieved Sep 6, 2008)].</ref> The center continues in the hands of a descendant of the original Langley Park estate owner, Leander McCormick-Goodhart. \n* Also, the Langley Park bus stop terminal for Prince George's County's The Bus Route 18, which served from the Addison Road Metro Station to Langley Park, used to be inside the Langley Park Plaza, right next to the place where Edwards Way intersects New Hampshire Avenue, until the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center opened in December 22, 2016. As of this date, the bus stop inside Langley Park Plaza by the intersection of Edwards Way and New Hampshire Avenue has been removed completely. The Bus route 18 began terminating at the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center instead. The route has still served between the Addison Road Metro Station and Langley Park ever since.\n* The other major shopping center that serves the Langley Park neighborhood at the intersection of University Boulevard and New Hampshire Avenue, is known as the '''Langley Park Shopping Center'''. Its volume is 135,000 square feet (12,500 square meters). Currently, its two main tenants are a [[Rite Aid]] Pharmacy Store and Woodland's Pure Vegetarian Indian restaurant. The shopping center initially opened in August 1951, when a [[Food Fair]] supermarket opened; it was later converted to an [[Acme Markets|Acme]], then [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]]. This center was home to a [[Drug Fair]], [[Marriott Corporation|Hot Shoppes]], and the 1,000-seat Langley Theater, which opened in March 1952.  The Langley Theater was eventually upgraded to a multi-screen theater in 1985, before eventually closing in the early 1990s when the owner, K/B Theaters, went out of business.<ref>[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/5770/ Cinema Treasures website, Langley Theater, Langley Park, Md (retrieved Sep 6, 2008)].</ref> The spot of the Langley Theater was eventually taken over by a new Woodland's Pure Vegetarian Indian Restaurant, which opened in March 1998 in the Langley Park Shopping Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/061407/enterev172427_32394.shtml|title=Langley Park favorite features vegetarian fare|website=www.gazette.net|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> A [[Taco Bell]] Fast Food Restaurant also opened in the Langley Park Shopping Center in the spring of 1998, taking over the spot that the former Hot Shoppes Fast Food Restaurant has occupied in the Langley Park Shopping Center, for more than four decades. Right next to the Woodland's Pure Vegetarian Indian Restaurant, there used to be a Subzi Mandi Indian Grocery store, which closed in the middle of 2011. There is a Gallo Clothing store, Dollar Store, Senor Coffee Shop, and Casa Blanca Bakery Shop that remain in operation still. The long-planned Takoma/Langley Crossroads Transit Center finally opened its doors on December 22, 2016 in the Langley Park Shopping Center parking lot, taking over most of the parking lot spaces and displacing Taco Bell's location by the shopping center. It mainly serves as a bus transfer point. At this transit center, people can get off one bus and transfer to another bus that gets them to their destination. After the Taco Bell was demolished, it relocated and opened its new store at the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and Holton Lane in the adjacent neighborhood of Takoma Park, Maryland. Taco Bell's new location is right next to where the Aldi's Supermarket and Caribbean Market are both located.\n* '''University Place''' is a small shopping center that serves the Langley Park neighborhood. It is located at the Intersection of University Boulevard and 15th Avenue. It consists of a China Palace Restaurant, La Chiquita Restaurant, Da Vita Dialysis Medical Store, Sweet Cash Pawn Store, a Laundromat/ Hair Salon Shop, and a [[Pho 75]] Vietnamese Restaurant. The Da Vita Dialysis Medical Store replaced the spot in the shopping center which housed the Indian Jewelry store named, \"Sam & Raj\", until the middle of 2007. Once Sam & Raj left the shopping center, a so-called, \"Lucky Jewelry & Gifts\" store opened. That store also ended up eventually closing in 2015. Also in the shopping center, the La Chiquita Restaurant is currently occupying the spot that used to house an Americana Grocery Latin American Supermarket for about fifteen years. The Americana Grocery Latin American Supermarket closed in 2016.\n* At the northwest corner of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, there is a very small shopping center that does not have a name. It consists of a Carolina Furniture Store, Western Union Bank, and Pep Boys Auto Repair Shop. The Carolina Furniture took over the spot of what used to be a \"Mattress Discounters Store\", in the middle of 2009. \n* Then, last but not least, on the northeast corner of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, there is another shopping center. This time, however; the shopping center is a little more jumbled up, meaning that it consists of stores that are in a wobbly line, rather than being organized in a single space. The shopping center consists of a Kenny's Caribbean Carryout Restaurant, Tire Shop, Exxon Mobil Gas Station, Krispy Kreme Donuts Store, Tiger Mart Convenience Store, 24- Hour Laundromat Shop, Family Dollar Store, Patel Brothers Indian Grocery Store, El Dorado Seafood Store. Domino's Pizza Restaurant, Seven Eleven Restaurant, Burger King Fast Food Restaurant, Irene's Papusas Fast Food Carryout Restaurant, and a Hyattsville Convenience Store. The Family Dollar store is currently occupying th space that used to house a Foot Locker Store. The Foot Locker Store closed in the middle of 2009, which is when Family Dollar took over/opened.\n\n== Apartment complexes ==\nAs mentioned earlier in the article, many of the apartment complexes in the Langley Park, MD neighborhood were built in the mid 1920s and early 1940s. It consists of quite a few different apartment complexes. \n# '''Campus Gardens Apartments''' (formerly \"'''''Isabella Gardens Apartments\"'''''), located at the intersections of University Boulevard to the south, Phelps Road to the east, and Riggs Road to the west.\n# '''University Gardens Apartments''', located at the intersections of Riggs Road to the east, 15th Avenue to the west, and Kanawha Street/ Jasmine Terrace to the south\n# '''The Marylander Condominiums''', located slightly north of the Campus Gardens Apartments   at the intersection of Riggs Road and Keokee Street\n# '''Serene Townhouse Village''', located north of the intersection of Riggs Road and Jasmine Terrace, right across from the University Gardens Apartments\n# '''Bedford Station Apartments''', located at the intersections of University Boulevard to the south, 15th Avenue to the east, 14th Avenue to the west, and Kanawha Street to the north.\n# '''The Villas at Langley Apartments''', located on 15th Ave. north of Kanawha Street and south of Merrimac Drive, surrounding the Casa de Maryland mansion.\n# '''Liberty Place Apartments''', located at the intersection of University Boulevard and 14th Avenue\n# '''Langley Terrace Apartments''', located at the intersections of 14th Avenue, Langley Way, and Merrimac Drive, behind Langley Park Plaza\n# '''Hampshire Village Apartments''', located at the intersection of New Hampshire and Merrimac Drive\n# '''Langley Gardens Apartments''', located at the intersections of New Hampshire Avenue, Lebanon Street, and University Boulevard; This apartment complex used to serve as the Langley Park bus terminal for Montgomery County Ride-On bus routes 15, 16, 17, and 18 until the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center opened in December, 2015.\n# '''University Landing Apartments''', located at the intersection of University Boulevard and Merrimac Drive, right next to the Prince Georges/ Montgomery County Line, where the neighborhoods of Langley Park and Silver Spring meet; This apartment complex also originally used to serve as another separate Langley Park bus stop terminal for Wmata's Metrobus Route F8 (Prince Georges- Langley Park Line), from the year of 1978 until December 22, 2016 when the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center opened. As of this date, Wmata's route F8 began terminating at the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center instead. This bus terminal also used to formerly also serve as the terminal for Prince Georges County's The Bus Route 17,  which served between Langley Park and the Ikea Store in College Park, MD until February 18, 2010. As of this date, The Bus Route 17 has been rerouted to serve from the bus terminal at the intersection of 34th Street & Rhode Island Avenue in Mount Rainier, MD to Ikea instead. Additionally, this bus terminal also used to serve UM Shuttle Bus Route 111, which traveled from the University of Maryland College Park Campus to the Silver Spring Metro Station. This bus route still traveled from the University of Maryland College Park to the Silver Spring Metro Station after no longer stopping at this bus stop. However, UM Shuttle Bus Route 111 was rerouted to use a more efficient route left from University Boulevard onto Piney Branch Road. This bus route used to stop at the intersection of University Boulevard and Merrimac Drive, turn right onto Carroll Avenue, and then turn left onto Piney Branch Road. The UM Shuttle Bus Route to the Silver Spring Metro Station did not initially stop at this bus stop, but was altered a few years ago to replace University of Maryland's former Adelphi South route that had been discontinued. UM Shuttle Bus Route 111 from the University of Maryland College Park Campus to the Silver Spring Metro Station also began stopping at the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center since it opened.\n# '''Victoria Station Apartments''', located slightly north of the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and Merrimac Drive \n# '''Suburban Hill Apartments''', located at the intersections of New Hampshire Avenue, Ruatan street, and Quebec Terrace, directly south of the Northwest Branch Anacostia Trail, bordering Adelphi and Silver Spring.\n# '''Quebec Arms Apartments''', located on the northern side of the intersection of 14th Avenue and Merrimac Drive\n\n==Geography==\nLangley Park is located at {{coord|38|59|39|N|76|58|54|W|type:city}} (38.994060, &minus;76.981759).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the place has a total area of {{convert|2.6|km2|order=flip}}, all land.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe racial and ethnic composition of the community has changed considerably as development patterns have evolved in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area.

The last major section would be developed in 1963.  Because of the wartime and immediate postwar demand for housing, the {{convert|540|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate was quickly developed for low-rise apartment homes, semi-detached, and single family homes.  Starting in 1949, a 1,542 garden apartment complex, Langley Park Apartments, now located along 14th Avenue, was built to house the exploding postwar population.<ref>\"4000 Apartment Units Planned,\" ''The Washington Post'', Feb 6, 1949, p.

It had been acquired in 1947 from the McCormick-Goodhart family by the [[Eudists|Eudist Order]] for use as a seminary.

The apartment complexes experienced substantial turnover in occupancy. Residents in the 14th Avenue and Kanawha Street area in particular were subjected to \"open air drug markets\" and other criminal activity. Long-time residents and the new immigrant communities were both victims of crime. Some homeowners organized to address neighborhood concerns about rising crime. For the 1988\u201389 school year, bus service for children who lived in walking distance to school was implemented to ensure their safety. Police also increased their presence in the community. Apartment complexes, under new management, initiated safety measures to discourage drug activity such as installing new lighting, security doors and maintaining general upkeep of their properties. At the same time, police in Prince George's County conducted multiple raids in an effort to shut down drug activity in the county.  By 1991, officials were taking note of an increase in illegal immigrants from Central America, and day laborers were beginning to become a common sight on area streets.<ref name=Naughton/>\n\n==Economy==\nLangley Park is probably best known as a center of commercial activity in northwestern Prince George's County. At each of the two corners of the New Hampshire Avenue / University Boulevard intersection is a large strip shopping center. One is known as the Langley Park Plaza (northeast corner), while the other is known as the Langley Park Shopping Center (northwest corner). There are also three other small shopping centers a few blocks east of New Hampshire Avenue, two are located on the northeast and northwest sides of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, while the third one is located at the intersection of University Boulevard and 15th Avenue.\n\n* '''Langley Park Plaza''' is the main shopping center that serves the Langley Park neighborhood. It was once the second largest strip mall in Maryland. Plans were originally announced in 1951 for development of the {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} site to include 40 stores and a six- to eight-story office building. The site remained undeveloped until 1954, when the Washington, D.C.-based department store [[Lansburgh's]] announced plans to open a three-story, {{convert|126750|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $2 million store.  It was the first major department store opened in Prince George's County.<ref>\"Lansburgh's Soon to Build a New Store,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Nov 21, 1954, p. M1.</ref>  Through the demise of the Lansburgh's chain in 1973, it would remain its most profitable store.  At the store's opening in October 1955, in addition to substantial displays and a payroll of 350, it contained the \"Hampshire Room\" &mdash; a luncheonette seating 90 and a community room to hold about 200.<ref>\"Lansburgh's New Store Opens,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Oct 18, 1955, p. 17.</ref><ref>\"Lansburgh's Prince George's County's First Department Store,\" ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'', Oct 23, 1955, p.

A Value Village Thrift store has occupied its former space in Lewisdale ever since [[Toys \"R\" Us]] closed there and moved to the Langley Park Plaza. Eventually when [[Toys \"R\" Us]] closed its store in the Langley Park Plaza, its spot remained vacant for a little over 2 years, until a Regency Furniture store opened in late June/ July 2009.  [https://www.regencyfurniture.com Regency Furniture] has been operating and still continues to operate in that spot inside Langley Park Plaza today. The [[Giant-Landover|Giant Food]] store closed around early 1998, right before Dutch-Based Royal Ahold Grocery Holdings Company was getting ready to buy the Giant supermarket chain.

Even though Atlantic Supermarket does not have a deli, the deli sign still remains. Many of the store sections from the former Giant Food Store, such as the fresh seafood counter, hot meal counter, snack aisle, cereal aisle, milk aisle, and typical frozen eggs, beverage, and yogurt aisle, still remain in operation by Atlantic Supermarket. The store front/ cashier section of the store and produce section were added by Atlantic Supermarket, as the former Giant did not have these sections when it operated.<ref name=\"Supermarket_fan\"/> Additionally, the Hispanic mural on top of the ceiling by the cash registers, was added by Atlantic Supermarket. The former Giant Food Store did not originally have this mural. The rest of the picture signs of each of the grocery aisles, do however remain from the former Giant Food Store. The old-fashioned Winn-Dixie style aisle markers are also from the Giant Food Store. The Atlantic Supermarket store initially started off as being a compact supermarket with a much simpler store sign, a white rectangle frame with a red rectangle in between and the words, \"Atlantic Supermarket\", in white print. The front store sign changed supposedly when Atlantic decided to do major expansion to its supermarket in the middle of 2005. The front store sign ended up being changed to a somewhat more modernized white, castle-like triangular sign with the words, \"Atlantic Supermarket International Foods\", in a reddish, lavender type of color. Atlantic Supermarket added a unique light blue circle in the center of its store sign. The supermarket also changed the former white rectangular border it originally had, to being light blue. The expansion reportedly took over part of the parking lot and displaced twelve parking spaces that used to available in the plaza. This step by Atlantic Supermarket has only contributed to making the parking lot much smaller than it used to be. This was in part due to the fact that the [[McDonald's]] Fast Food Restaurant, which opened right outside the Langley Park Plaza in 1998, was already occupying quite a few former parking spaces of the huge parking lot. In addition to carrying classic American groceries found in many supermarket chains across America, they also offer a special selection of Latin-American, Asian, African, and Caribbean foods not formerly offered by the Giant Food Store.<ref name=\"Supermarket_fan\"/> Atlantic Supermarket offers a much broader section of fresh fruits and vegetables than traditional American supermarkets, as well. Also, the [[Peoples Drug]] store was converted into a [[CVS Pharmacy]] store when CVS corporation bought the 490-store [[Peoples Drug]] chain in the mid-nineties. The old-fashioned University Liquor store that has been inside the Langley Park Plaza for roughly five decades, is still operating in the Langley Park Plaza today. Also operating in the plaza today are Rainbow Clothing, New York Factory Outlet, Dollar Store, Jewelry Store, Family Furniture Discount Store, and At&t retailer store. The At&t retailer shop was added to the Langley Park Plaza in 2015. Prior to 2015, the spot At&t is currently operating in, has not been occupied.\n* In recent years, the Langley Park Plaza has become a shopping destination for many recent immigrants, especially those from [[Central America]]. An attraction in the Langley Park Plaza is a fountain, nestled in a section of the mall, where recent immigrants take photos to show their families and friends at home that they have arrived in the United States.<ref>\"Immigrants Give Md. Fountain a Global Reach,\" by Allison Klein, ''The Washington Post'', May 22, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/09/ST2008060900748.html \"A Stream From Ipala,\" by David Montgomery, ''The Washington Post'', June 9, 2008 p. C1 (retrieved Sep 6, 2008)].</ref> The center continues in the hands of a descendant of the original Langley Park estate owner, Leander McCormick-Goodhart. \n* Also, the Langley Park bus stop terminal for Prince George's County's The Bus Route 18, which served from the Addison Road Metro Station to Langley Park, used to be inside the Langley Park Plaza, right next to the place where Edwards Way intersects New Hampshire Avenue, until the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center opened in December 22, 2016. As of this date, the bus stop inside Langley Park Plaza by the intersection of Edwards Way and New Hampshire Avenue has been removed completely. The Bus route 18 began terminating at the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center instead. The route has still served between the Addison Road Metro Station and Langley Park ever since.\n* The other major shopping center that serves the Langley Park neighborhood at the intersection of University Boulevard and New Hampshire Avenue, is known as the '''Langley Park Shopping Center'''. Its volume is 135,000 square feet (12,500 square meters). Currently, its two main tenants are a [[Rite Aid]] Pharmacy Store and Woodland's Pure Vegetarian Indian restaurant. The shopping center initially opened in August 1951, when a [[Food Fair]] supermarket opened; it was later converted to an [[Acme Markets|Acme]], then [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]]. This center was home to a [[Drug Fair]], [[Marriott Corporation|Hot Shoppes]], and the 1,000-seat Langley Theater, which opened in March 1952.  The Langley Theater was eventually upgraded to a multi-screen theater in 1985, before eventually closing in the early 1990s when the owner, K/B Theaters, went out of business.<ref>[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/5770/ Cinema Treasures website, Langley Theater, Langley Park, Md (retrieved Sep 6, 2008)].</ref> The spot of the Langley Theater was eventually taken over by a new Woodland's Pure Vegetarian Indian Restaurant, which opened in March 1998 in the Langley Park Shopping Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/061407/enterev172427_32394.shtml|title=Langley Park favorite features vegetarian fare|website=www.gazette.net|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> A [[Taco Bell]] Fast Food Restaurant also opened in the Langley Park Shopping Center in the spring of 1998, taking over the spot that the former Hot Shoppes Fast Food Restaurant has occupied in the Langley Park Shopping Center, for more than four decades. Right next to the Woodland's Pure Vegetarian Indian Restaurant, there used to be a Subzi Mandi Indian Grocery store, which closed in the middle of 2011. There is a Gallo Clothing store, Dollar Store, Senor Coffee Shop, and Casa Blanca Bakery Shop that remain in operation still. The long-planned Takoma/Langley Crossroads Transit Center finally opened its doors on December 22, 2016 in the Langley Park Shopping Center parking lot, taking over most of the parking lot spaces and displacing Taco Bell's location by the shopping center. It mainly serves as a bus transfer point. At this transit center, people can get off one bus and transfer to another bus that gets them to their destination. After the Taco Bell was demolished, it relocated and opened its new store at the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and Holton Lane in the adjacent neighborhood of Takoma Park, Maryland. Taco Bell's new location is right next to where the Aldi's Supermarket and Caribbean Market are both located.\n* '''University Place''' is a small shopping center that serves the Langley Park neighborhood. It is located at the Intersection of University Boulevard and 15th Avenue. It consists of a China Palace Restaurant, La Chiquita Restaurant, Da Vita Dialysis Medical Store, Sweet Cash Pawn Store, a Laundromat/ Hair Salon Shop, and a [[Pho 75]] Vietnamese Restaurant. The Da Vita Dialysis Medical Store replaced the spot in the shopping center which housed the Indian Jewelry store named, \"Sam & Raj\", until the middle of 2007. Once Sam & Raj left the shopping center, a so-called, \"Lucky Jewelry & Gifts\" store opened. That store also ended up eventually closing in 2015. Also in the shopping center, the La Chiquita Restaurant is currently occupying the spot that used to house an Americana Grocery Latin American Supermarket for about fifteen years. The Americana Grocery Latin American Supermarket closed in 2016.\n* At the northwest corner of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, there is a very small shopping center that does not have a name. It consists of a Carolina Furniture Store, Western Union Bank, and Pep Boys Auto Repair Shop. The Carolina Furniture took over the spot of what used to be a \"Mattress Discounters Store\", in the middle of 2009. \n* Then, last but not least, on the northeast corner of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, there is another shopping center. This time, however; the shopping center is a little more jumbled up, meaning that it consists of stores that are in a wobbly line, rather than being organized in a single space. The shopping center consists of a Kenny's Caribbean Carryout Restaurant, Tire Shop, Exxon Mobil Gas Station, Krispy Kreme Donuts Store, Tiger Mart Convenience Store, 24- Hour Laundromat Shop, Family Dollar Store, Patel Brothers Indian Grocery Store, El Dorado Seafood Store. Domino's Pizza Restaurant, Seven Eleven Restaurant, Burger King Fast Food Restaurant, Irene's Papusas Fast Food Carryout Restaurant, and a Hyattsville Convenience Store. The Family Dollar store is currently occupying th space that used to house a Foot Locker Store. The Foot Locker Store closed in the middle of 2009, which is when Family Dollar took over/opened.\n\n== Apartment complexes ==\nAs mentioned earlier in the article, many of the apartment complexes in the Langley Park, MD neighborhood were built in the mid 1920s and early 1940s. It consists of quite a few different apartment complexes. \n# '''Campus Gardens Apartments''' (formerly \"'''''Isabella Gardens Apartments\"'''''), located at the intersections of University Boulevard to the south, Phelps Road to the east, and Riggs Road to the west.\n# '''University Gardens Apartments''', located at the intersections of Riggs Road to the east, 15th Avenue to the west, and Kanawha Street/ Jasmine Terrace to the south\n# '''The Marylander Condominiums''', located slightly north of the Campus Gardens Apartments   at the intersection of Riggs Road and Keokee Street\n# '''Serene Townhouse Village''', located north of the intersection of Riggs Road and Jasmine Terrace, right across from the University Gardens Apartments\n# '''Bedford Station Apartments''', located at the intersections of University Boulevard to the south, 15th Avenue to the east, 14th Avenue to the west, and Kanawha Street to the north.\n# '''The Villas at Langley Apartments''', located on 15th Ave. north of Kanawha Street and south of Merrimac Drive, surrounding the Casa de Maryland mansion.\n# '''Liberty Place Apartments''', located at the intersection of University Boulevard and 14th Avenue\n# '''Langley Terrace Apartments''', located at the intersections of 14th Avenue, Langley Way, and Merrimac Drive, behind Langley Park Plaza\n# '''Hampshire Village Apartments''', located at the intersection of New Hampshire and Merrimac Drive\n# '''Langley Gardens Apartments''', located at the intersections of New Hampshire Avenue, Lebanon Street, and University Boulevard; This apartment complex used to serve as the Langley Park bus terminal for Montgomery County Ride-On bus routes 15, 16, 17, and 18 until the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center opened in December, 2015.\n# '''University Landing Apartments''', located at the intersection of University Boulevard and Merrimac Drive, right next to the Prince Georges/ Montgomery County Line, where the neighborhoods of Langley Park and Silver Spring meet; This apartment complex also originally used to serve as another separate Langley Park bus stop terminal for Wmata's Metrobus Route F8 (Prince Georges- Langley Park Line), from the year of 1978 until December 22, 2016 when the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center opened. As of this date, Wmata's route F8 began terminating at the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center instead. This bus terminal also used to formerly also serve as the terminal for Prince Georges County's The Bus Route 17,  which served between Langley Park and the Ikea Store in College Park, MD until February 18, 2010. As of this date, The Bus Route 17 has been rerouted to serve from the bus terminal at the intersection of 34th Street & Rhode Island Avenue in Mount Rainier, MD to Ikea instead. Additionally, this bus terminal also used to serve UM Shuttle Bus Route 111, which traveled from the University of Maryland College Park Campus to the Silver Spring Metro Station. This bus route still traveled from the University of Maryland College Park to the Silver Spring Metro Station after no longer stopping at this bus stop. However, UM Shuttle Bus Route 111 was rerouted to use a more efficient route left from University Boulevard onto Piney Branch Road. This bus route used to stop at the intersection of University Boulevard and Merrimac Drive, turn right onto Carroll Avenue, and then turn left onto Piney Branch Road. The UM Shuttle Bus Route to the Silver Spring Metro Station did not initially stop at this bus stop, but was altered a few years ago to replace University of Maryland's former Adelphi South route that had been discontinued. UM Shuttle Bus Route 111 from the University of Maryland College Park Campus to the Silver Spring Metro Station also began stopping at the Takoma Langley Crossroads Center since it opened.\n# '''Victoria Station Apartments''', located slightly north of the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and Merrimac Drive \n# '''Suburban Hill Apartments''', located at the intersections of New Hampshire Avenue, Ruatan street, and Quebec Terrace, directly south of the Northwest Branch Anacostia Trail, bordering Adelphi and Silver Spring.\n# '''Quebec Arms Apartments''', located on the northern side of the intersection of 14th Avenue and Merrimac Drive\n\n==Geography==\nLangley Park is located at {{coord|38|59|39|N|76|58|54|W|type:city}} (38.994060, &minus;76.981759).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the place has a total area of {{convert|2.6|km2|order=flip}}, all land.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe racial and ethnic composition of the community has changed considerably as development patterns have evolved in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area.

He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others' reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination. \n\nHe was [[Impressment|pressed]] (conscripted) into service in the [[Royal Navy]]. After leaving the service, he became involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of [[County Donegal]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], so severely that he called out to God for mercy. This moment marked [[John Newton#Spiritual conversion|his spiritual conversion]] but he continued slave trading until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether. He began studying [[Christian theology]].\n\nOrdained in the [[Church of England]] in 1764, Newton became [[curate]] of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]], where he began to write hymns with poet [[William Cowper]]. \"Amazing Grace\" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have been chanted by the congregation. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's ''[[Olney Hymns]]'' but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States, \"Amazing Grace\" became a popular song used by Baptist and Methodist preachers as part of their evangelizing, especially in the South, during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies. In 1835, American composer [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]] set it to the tune known as \"New Britain\" in a shape-note format. This is the version most frequently sung today.\n\nWith the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, \"Amazing Grace\" is one of the most recognisable songs in the English-speaking world. Author [[Gilbert Chase]] writes that it is \"without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns\".<ref>Chase, p. 181.</ref> [[Jonathan Aitken]], a Newton biographer, estimates that the song is performed about 10&nbsp;million times annually.<ref name=\"aitken224\"/> It has had particular influence in [[folk music]], and has become an emblematic black [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. \"Amazing Grace\" became newly popular during a [[American folk music revival|revival of folk music in the US during the 1960s]], and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, in versions that have occasionally ranked on popular music charts.\n\n== John Newton's conversion ==\n{{quote box\n| width = 22em\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = How industrious is Satan served.

His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] but had [[Protestant]] sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent, unaffiliated with the [[Anglican Church]]. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was six years old (How could Newton's mother have died at the age of six?).<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 8\u20139.</ref> For the next few years, while his father was at sea Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother. He was also sent to boarding school, where he was mistreated.<ref>Newton (1824), p. 12.</ref> At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\n\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed with him ''[[Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times]]'', a book by the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Earl of Shaftesbury]]. In a series of letters Newton later wrote, \"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the [[Gospel]] at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\"<ref>Newton (1824), pp. 21\u201322.</ref> His disobedience caused him to be [[Impressment|pressed]] into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave. \n\nHe deserted the navy to visit Mary \"Polly\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.<ref>Martin (1950), p. 23.</ref> After enduring humiliation for deserting,{{efn|Stripped of his rank, whipped in public, and subjected to the abuses directed to prisoners and other press-ganged men in the Navy, he demonstrated insolence and rebellion during his service for the next few months, remarking that the only reason he did not murder the captain or commit suicide was because he did not want Polly to think badly of him. (Martin [1950], pp. 41\u201347.)}} he was traded as crew to a slave ship. \n\nHe began a career in slave trading.{{efn|Newton kept a series of detailed journals as a slave trader; these are perhaps the first primary source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the perspective of a merchant (Moyers). Women, naked or nearly so, upon their arrival on ship were claimed by the sailors, and Newton alluded to sexual misbehavior in his writings that has since been interpreted by historians to mean that he, along with other sailors, took (and presumably raped) whomever he chose. (Martin [1950], pp.&nbsp;82\u201385)(Aitken, p. 64.)}}\n \n[[File:Newton j.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Engraving of an older heavyset man, wearing robes, vestments, and wig|[[John Newton]] in his later years]]\n\nNewton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him, which  became so popular that the crew began to join in.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 51\u201352.</ref> His disagreements with several colleagues resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea, and chained like the slaves they carried. He was himself enslaved and forced to work on a plantation in the British colony [[Sierra Leone]] near the [[Sherbro River]]. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and crew from another ship happened to find him.{{efn|Newton's father was friends with Joseph Manesty, who intervened several times in Newton's life. Newton was supposed to go to Jamaica on Manesty's ship, but missed it while he was with the Catletts. When Newton's father got his son's letter detailing his conditions in Sierra Leone, he asked Manesty to find Newton. Manesty sent the ''Greyhound'', which travelled along the African coast trading at various stops. An associate of Newton lit a fire, signalling to ships he was interested in trading just 30 minutes before the ''Greyhound'' appeared. (Aitken, pp. 34\u201335, 64\u201365.)}} Newton claimed the only reason he left the colony was because of Polly.<ref>Martin (1950), p. 63.</ref>\n\nWhile aboard the ship ''Greyhound'', Newton gained notoriety as being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met. In a culture where sailors habitually swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 67\u201368.</ref> In March 1748, while the ''Greyhound'' was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before.{{efn|Several retellings of Newton's life story claim that he was carrying slaves during the voyage in which he experienced his conversion, but the ship was carrying livestock, wood, and beeswax from the coast of Africa. (Aitken, p. 76.)}} After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours.<ref name=Martin73/> After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, \"If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!\"<ref>Newton (1824), p. 41.</ref><ref>Martin (1950), pp. 70\u201371.</ref> Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel, he pondered his divine challenge.<ref name=Martin73>Martin (1950), p. 73.</ref>\n\nAbout two weeks later, the battered ship and starving crew landed in [[Lough Swilly]], Ireland. For several weeks before the storm, Newton had been reading ''The Christian's Pattern'', a summary of the 15th-century ''[[The Imitation of Christ (book)|The Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]]. The memory of his own \"Lord have mercy upon us!\" uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable. Not only had he neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.<ref>Aitken, pp. 81\u201384.</ref>\n\nNewton's conversion was not immediate, but he contacted Polly's family and announced his intention to marry her. Her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane too but  allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake.<ref name=\"martin82-85\">Martin (1950), pp. 82\u201385.</ref> He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries.{{efn|When Newton began his journal in 1750, not only was slave trading seen as a respectable profession by the majority of Britons, its necessity to the overall prosperity of the kingdom was communally understood and approved. Only [[Quaker]]s, who were much in the minority and perceived as eccentric, had raised any protest about the practice. (Martin and Spurrell [1962], pp. xi\u2013xii.)}} Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed the coasts of Africa, now as a captain, and procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, transporting them to North America. \n\nIn between voyages, he married Polly in 1750, and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip. After three shipping voyages in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery. But at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.<ref>Aitken, p. 125.</ref>{{efn|Newton's biographers and Newton himself does not put a name to this episode other than a \"fit\" in which he became unresponsive, suffering dizziness and a headache. His doctor advised him not to go to sea again, and Newton complied. Jonathan Aitken called it a stroke or [[seizure]], but its cause is unknown.

He and Polly immersed themselves in the church community, and Newton's passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a priest in the Church of England.

The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor.<ref name=\"aitken224\">Aitken, p. 224.</ref> Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 208\u2013217.</ref> But his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to \"break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart\".<ref name=\"pollock\"/> He struck a friendship with [[William Cowper]], a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times. Cowper enjoyed Olney{{snd}} and Newton's company; he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's. Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive. In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners. They also began writing lessons for children.<ref>Turner, p. 76.</ref>\n\nPartly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including [[Isaac Watts]]{{snd}} whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing<ref>Aitken, p. 28.</ref>{{snd}} and [[Charles Wesley]], with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother [[John Wesley|John]], the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy.{{efn|Watts had previously written a hymn named \"Alas! And Did My Saviour Bleed\" that contained the lines \"Amazing pity! Grace unknown!/ And love beyond degree!\". [[Philip Doddridge]], another well-known hymn writer, wrote another in 1755 titled \"The Humiliation and Exaltation of God's Israel\" that began \"Amazing grace of God on high!\" and included other similar wording to Newton's verses. Newton biographer Jonathan Aitken states that Watts had inspired most of Newton's compositions. (Turner, pp. 82\u201383.)(Aitken, pp. 28\u201329.)}} Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the [[Psalms]]. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the [[common meter]] in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.<ref name=\"turner77-79\">Turner, pp. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\nNewton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to \"Amazing Grace\" were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on 1 January 1773.<ref name=\"turner77-79\"/> A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title ''[[Olney Hymns]]''. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in ''Olney Hymns''; \"1 Chronicles 17:16\u201317, Faith's Review and Expectation\" was the title of the poem with the first line \"Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)\".<ref name=\"dah\"/>\n\n=== Critical analysis ===\nThe general impact of ''Olney Hymns'' was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language, expressing his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in ''Olney Hymns'' are faith in salvation, wonder at [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]], his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.<ref>Benson, p. 339.</ref> As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in [[first-person narrative|first person]], admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in ''Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America'' considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.<ref name=\"hindmarsh6\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 6.</ref> Several of Newton's hymns were recognised as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them), while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.<ref>Benson, p. 338.</ref> [[Jonathan Aitken]] calls Newton, specifically referring to \"Amazing Grace\", an \"unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation\", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.<ref>Aitken, p. 226.</ref>\n\nWilliam Phipps in the ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'' and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of \"Amazing Grace\" as evidence of Newton's realisation that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations.<ref name=\"phipps\">Phipps, William (Summer 1990). \" 'Amazing Grace' in the hymnwriter's life\", ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'', '''72''' (3), pp. 306\u2013313.</ref><ref name=\"basker281\"/> Newton joined forces with a young man named [[William Wilberforce]], the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. But Newton did not become an ardent and outspoken [[abolitionist]] until  after he left Olney in the 1780s; he is not known to have connected writing the hymn known as \"Amazing Grace\" to anti-slavery sentiments.<ref>Aitken, p. 231.</ref> \n\nThe lyrics in ''Olney Hymns'' were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings, and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary{{snd}} which has since been lost{{snd}} that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing. The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.<ref name=\"aitken227\">Aitken, p. 227.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| align = left\n| width = 22em\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = And David the king came and sat before the {{LORD}}, and said, Who ''am'' I, O {{LORD}} God, and what ''is'' mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people.<ref name=\"hindmarsh8\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 8.</ref> Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratitude for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await.<ref>Turner, p. 81.</ref> Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly,<ref name=\"watson215\"/> and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were \"blinded by the god of this world\" until \"mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired&nbsp;... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace.\"<ref name=\"aitken227\"/>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] served as the basis for many of the lyrics of \"Amazing Grace\". The first verse, for example, can be traced to the story of the [[Prodigal Son]]. In the [[Gospel of Luke]] the father says, \"For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found\". The story of Jesus [[Miracles of Jesus#The blind|healing a blind man]] who tells the [[Pharisees]] that he can now see is told in the [[Gospel of John]]. Newton used the words \"I was blind but now I see\" and declared \"Oh to grace how great a debtor!\" in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752.<ref name=\"aitken228\">Aitken, p. 228.</ref> The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation \"Amazing grace!\", to be followed by a qualifying reply in \"how sweet the sound\". In ''An Annotated Anthology of Hymns'', Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called \"crude but effective\" in an overall composition that \"suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith\".<ref name=\"watson215\">Watson, p. 215.</ref> Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.<ref name=\"hindmarsh6\"/>\n\nThe sermon preached by Newton was his last of those that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental instability returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author of ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.<ref>Turner, p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:New Britain Southern Harmony Amazing Grace.jpg|thumb|450px|alt=Original long hymnal with shape note music notation of a tune titled \"New Britain\" set to Newton's first verse, with four subsequent verses printed below.

A tremendous religious movement swept the US in the early 19th century, marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start on the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended [[camp meeting]]s where they came to experience salvation; preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding.<ref name=\"turner115-116\">Turner, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref> Religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony, and made as plain and simple as possible; sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin. Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace.<ref name=\"hindmarsh10\"/> \"Amazing Grace\" was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAmazing grace! How sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me.\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nWas blind but now I see.\n\nShout, shout for glory,\nShout, shout aloud for glory;\nBrother, sister, mourner,\nAll shout glory hallelujah.<ref name=\"turner115-116\"/>\n</poem>}}\n\nSimultaneously, an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds to symbolise the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Other groups would sing outside, on benches set up in a square. Preachers used [[shape note]] hymns to teach people on the frontier and to raise the emotion of camp meetings. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung [[a cappella]].<ref>Turner, p. 117.</ref>\n\n[[File:William Walker, American composer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Grainy portrait of a middle aged white man in a black suit|[[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]], the American composer who first set John Newton's verses to the \"New Britain\" tune, creating version of the song known as \"Amazing Grace\"]]\n\n=== \"New Britain\" tune ===\nWhen originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in ''A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns'' (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \"Hephzibah\" by English composer [[John Jenkins Husband (composer)|John Husband]].<ref>[http://hymntune.library.uiuc.edu/ The Hymn Tune Index], Search=\"Hephzibah\".

This was an amalgamation of two melodies (\"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\"), first published in the ''Columbian Harmony'' by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's [[Centre College]], compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\" had not.<ref>Turner, pp. 120\u2013122.</ref> As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.<ref>Turner, p. 123.</ref> A manuscript from 1828 by [[Lucius Chapin]], a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \"St. Mary\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2015/did-lucius-chapin-write-the-amazing-grace-tune/|title=Did Lucius Chapin write the Amazing Grace tune?|date=12 May 2015|author=Rachel Wells Hall}}</ref>\n\n\"Amazing Grace\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \"New Britain\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook ''[[Southern Harmony]]'' in 1847.<ref name=\"hindmarsh11\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 11.</ref> It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \"marriage made in heaven&nbsp;...

It was one of between 50 and 70 verses of a song titled \"Jerusalem, My Happy Home\", which was first published in a 1790 book called ''A Collection of Sacred Ballads'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nWhen we've been there ten thousand years,\nBright shining as the sun,\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise,\nThan when we first begun.<ref>Aitken, p. 235.</ref><ref>Watson, p. 216.</ref>\n</poem>}}\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Amazing Grace_-_Sacred Harp Singing Society.ogg\n| title = Shape note version of \"Amazing Grace\" recorded by Alan and John Lomax in Birmingham, Alabama, 1942\n| description = This version also includes Newton's sixth verse, which is uncommon in recordings.

Shape-note singing communities, with all the members sitting around an open center, each song employing a different song leader, illustrated this in practice. Simultaneously, the US began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The \"dangers, toils, and snares\" of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans.<ref name=\"turner126\"/> This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). \"Amazing Grace\", set to \"New Britain\", was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers. With death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace.<ref>Turner, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> The hymn was translated into other languages as well: while on the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Cherokee]] sang Christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy, and a version of the song by [[Samuel Worcester]] that had been translated into the [[Cherokee language]] became very popular.<ref>Duvall, p. 35.</ref><ref>Swiderski, p. 91.</ref>\n\n=== Urban revival ===\nAlthough \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" was popular, other versions existed regionally. [[Primitive Baptist]]s in the Appalachian region often used \"New Britain\" with other hymns, and sometimes sing the words of \"Amazing Grace\" to other folk songs, including titles such as \"[[In the Pines]]\", \"Pisgah\", \"Primrose\", and \"Evan\", as all are able to be sung in common meter, of which the majority of their repertoire consists.<ref>Patterson, p. 137.</ref><ref>Sutton, Brett (January 1982). \"Shape-Note Tune Books and Primitive Hymns\", ''Ethnomusicology'', '''26''' (1), pp. 11\u201326.</ref> In the late 19th century, Newton's verses were sung to a tune named \"Arlington\" as frequently as to \"New Britain\" for a time.\n\nTwo musical arrangers named [[Dwight Moody]] and [[Ira Sankey]] heralded another religious revival in the cities of the US and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of [[gospel music]], and churches all over the US were eager to acquire them.<ref>Turner, pp. 133\u2013135.</ref> Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and \"Amazing Grace\" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the [[incipit]]s (first line of the lyrics), or the name of the tune such as \"New Britain\". Publisher [[Edwin Othello Excell]] gave the version of \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving \"New Britain\" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910. His  version of \"Amazing Grace\" became the standard form of the song in American churches.<ref>Noll and Blumhofer, p. 13.</ref><ref>Turner, pp. 137\u2013138, 140\u2013145.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Amazing grace2.ogg\n| title = \"Amazing Grace\" a cappella with hymn lining\n| description = This recording of three singers was done for the ''Archive of American Folk-Song'' in Livingston, Alabama, in 1939, and is in the U.S. Library of Congress.\n}}\n\n== Recorded versions ==\nWith the advent of recorded music and radio, \"Amazing Grace\" began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed \"Amazing Grace\" to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of \"Amazing Grace\" uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience.

Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at [[Lincoln Center]], where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them.<ref name=\"pollock\">Pollock, John (2009). \"Amazing Grace: The great Sea Change in the Life of John Newton\", ''The Trinity Forum Reading'', The Trinity Forum.</ref> James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose \"Amazing Grace\" to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: \"there is a transformative power that is applicable&nbsp;... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature.\"<ref>Basker, p. xxxiv.</ref>\n\nMoyers interviewed Collins, Cash, opera singer [[Jessye Norman]], Appalachian folk musician [[Jean Ritchie]] and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the [[Huntsville Unit|Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville]]. Collins, Cash, and Norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday]], stated, \"I don't know whether it's the text{{snd}} I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people{{snd}} or whether it's that tune that everybody knows.\" A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: \"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved\" by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realised he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer [[Marion Williams]] summed up its effect: \"That's a song that gets to everybody\".<ref name=\"moyers\"/>\n\nThe ''Dictionary of American Hymnology'' claims it is included in more than a thousand published hymnals, and recommends its use for \"occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by God's grace alone; as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon; as a confession of faith or after the sermon\".<ref name=\"dah\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jonathan Aitken|Aitken, Jonathan]] (2007).

He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others' reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination. \n\nHe was [[Impressment|pressed]] (conscripted) into service in the [[Royal Navy]]. After leaving the service, he became involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of [[County Donegal]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], so severely that he called out to God for mercy. This moment marked [[John Newton#Spiritual conversion|his spiritual conversion]] but he continued slave trading until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether. He began studying [[Christian theology]].\n\nOrdained in the [[Church of England]] in 1764, Newton became [[curate]] of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]], where he began to write hymns with poet [[William Cowper]]. \"Amazing Grace\" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have been chanted by the congregation. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's ''[[Olney Hymns]]'' but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States, \"Amazing Grace\" became a popular song used by Baptist and Methodist preachers as part of their evangelizing, especially in the South, during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies. In 1835, American composer [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]] set it to the tune known as \"New Britain\" in a shape-note format. This is the version most frequently sung today.\n\nWith the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, \"Amazing Grace\" is one of the most recognisable songs in the English-speaking world. Author [[Gilbert Chase]] writes that it is \"without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns\".<ref>Chase, p. 181.</ref> [[Jonathan Aitken]], a Newton biographer, estimates that the song is performed about 10&nbsp;million times annually.<ref name=\"aitken224\"/> It has had particular influence in [[folk music]], and has become an emblematic black [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. \"Amazing Grace\" became newly popular during a [[American folk music revival|revival of folk music in the US during the 1960s]], and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, in versions that have occasionally ranked on popular music charts.\n\n== John Newton's conversion ==\n{{quote box\n| width = 22em\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = How industrious is Satan served.

His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] but had [[Protestant]] sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent, unaffiliated with the [[Anglican Church]]. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was six years old.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 8\u20139.</ref> For the next few years, while his father was at sea Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother. He was also sent to boarding school, where he was mistreated.<ref>Newton (1824), p. 12.</ref> At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\n\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed with him ''[[Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times]]'', a book by the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Earl of Shaftesbury]]. In a series of letters Newton later wrote, \"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the [[Gospel]] at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\"<ref>Newton (1824), pp. 21\u201322.</ref> His disobedience caused him to be [[Impressment|pressed]] into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave. \n\nHe deserted the navy to visit Mary \"Polly\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.<ref>Martin (1950), p. 23.</ref> After enduring humiliation for deserting,{{efn|Stripped of his rank, whipped in public, and subjected to the abuses directed to prisoners and other press-ganged men in the Navy, he demonstrated insolence and rebellion during his service for the next few months, remarking that the only reason he did not murder the captain or commit suicide was because he did not want Polly to think badly of him. (Martin [1950], pp. 41\u201347.)}} he was traded as crew to a slave ship. \n\nHe began a career in slave trading.{{efn|Newton kept a series of detailed journals as a slave trader; these are perhaps the first primary source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the perspective of a merchant (Moyers). Women, naked or nearly so, upon their arrival on ship were claimed by the sailors, and Newton alluded to sexual misbehavior in his writings that has since been interpreted by historians to mean that he, along with other sailors, took (and presumably raped) whomever he chose. (Martin [1950], pp.&nbsp;82\u201385)(Aitken, p. 64.)}}\n \n[[File:Newton j.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Engraving of an older heavyset man, wearing robes, vestments, and wig|[[John Newton]] in his later years]]\n\nNewton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him, which  became so popular that the crew began to join in.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 51\u201352.</ref> His disagreements with several colleagues resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea, and chained like the slaves they carried. He was himself enslaved and forced to work on a plantation in the British colony [[Sierra Leone]] near the [[Sherbro River]]. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and crew from another ship happened to find him.{{efn|Newton's father was friends with Joseph Manesty, who intervened several times in Newton's life. Newton was supposed to go to Jamaica on Manesty's ship, but missed it while he was with the Catletts. When Newton's father got his son's letter detailing his conditions in Sierra Leone, he asked Manesty to find Newton. Manesty sent the ''Greyhound'', which travelled along the African coast trading at various stops. An associate of Newton lit a fire, signalling to ships he was interested in trading just 30 minutes before the ''Greyhound'' appeared.

In a culture where sailors habitually swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 67\u201368.</ref> In March 1748, while the ''Greyhound'' was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before.{{efn|Several retellings of Newton's life story claim that he was carrying slaves during the voyage in which he experienced his conversion, but the ship was carrying livestock, wood, and beeswax from the coast of Africa.

For several weeks before the storm, Newton had been reading ''The Christian's Pattern'', a summary of the 15th-century ''[[The Imitation of Christ (book)|The Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]]. The memory of his own \"Lord have mercy upon us!\" uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable. Not only had he neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.<ref>Aitken, pp. 81\u201384.</ref>\n\nNewton's conversion was not immediate, but he contacted Polly's family and announced his intention to marry her. Her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane too but  allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake.<ref name=\"martin82-85\">Martin (1950), pp. 82\u201385.</ref> He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries.{{efn|When Newton began his journal in 1750, not only was slave trading seen as a respectable profession by the majority of Britons, its necessity to the overall prosperity of the kingdom was communally understood and approved. Only [[Quaker]]s, who were much in the minority and perceived as eccentric, had raised any protest about the practice. (Martin and Spurrell [1962], pp. xi\u2013xii.)}} Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed the coasts of Africa, now as a captain, and procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, transporting them to North America. \n\nIn between voyages, he married Polly in 1750, and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip. After three shipping voyages in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery. But at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.<ref>Aitken, p. 125.</ref>{{efn|Newton's biographers and Newton himself does not put a name to this episode other than a \"fit\" in which he became unresponsive, suffering dizziness and a headache.

The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor.<ref name=\"aitken224\">Aitken, p. 224.</ref> Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished.<ref>Martin (1950), pp. 208\u2013217.</ref> But his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to \"break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart\".<ref name=\"pollock\"/> He struck a friendship with [[William Cowper]], a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times. Cowper enjoyed Olney{{snd}} and Newton's company; he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's. Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive. In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners. They also began writing lessons for children.<ref>Turner, p. 76.</ref>\n\nPartly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including [[Isaac Watts]]{{snd}} whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing<ref>Aitken, p. 28.</ref>{{snd}} and [[Charles Wesley]], with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother [[John Wesley|John]], the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy.{{efn|Watts had previously written a hymn named \"Alas! And Did My Saviour Bleed\" that contained the lines \"Amazing pity! Grace unknown!/ And love beyond degree!\". [[Philip Doddridge]], another well-known hymn writer, wrote another in 1755 titled \"The Humiliation and Exaltation of God's Israel\" that began \"Amazing grace of God on high!\" and included other similar wording to Newton's verses. Newton biographer Jonathan Aitken states that Watts had inspired most of Newton's compositions. (Turner, pp. 82\u201383.)(Aitken, pp. 28\u201329.)}} Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the [[Psalms]]. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the [[common meter]] in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.<ref name=\"turner77-79\">Turner, pp. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\nNewton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to \"Amazing Grace\" were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on 1 January 1773.<ref name=\"turner77-79\"/> A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title ''[[Olney Hymns]]''. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in ''Olney Hymns''; \"1 Chronicles 17:16\u201317, Faith's Review and Expectation\" was the title of the poem with the first line \"Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)\".<ref name=\"dah\"/>\n\n=== Critical analysis ===\nThe general impact of ''Olney Hymns'' was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language, expressing his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in ''Olney Hymns'' are faith in salvation, wonder at [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]], his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.<ref>Benson, p. 339.</ref> As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in [[first-person narrative|first person]], admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in ''Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America'' considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.<ref name=\"hindmarsh6\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 6.</ref> Several of Newton's hymns were recognised as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them), while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.<ref>Benson, p. 338.</ref> [[Jonathan Aitken]] calls Newton, specifically referring to \"Amazing Grace\", an \"unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation\", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.<ref>Aitken, p. 226.</ref>\n\nWilliam Phipps in the ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'' and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of \"Amazing Grace\" as evidence of Newton's realisation that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations.<ref name=\"phipps\">Phipps, William (Summer 1990). \" 'Amazing Grace' in the hymnwriter's life\", ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'', '''72''' (3), pp. 306\u2013313.</ref><ref name=\"basker281\"/> Newton joined forces with a young man named [[William Wilberforce]], the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. But Newton did not become an ardent and outspoken [[abolitionist]] until  after he left Olney in the 1780s; he is not known to have connected writing the hymn known as \"Amazing Grace\" to anti-slavery sentiments.<ref>Aitken, p. 231.</ref> \n\nThe lyrics in ''Olney Hymns'' were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings, and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary{{snd}} which has since been lost{{snd}} that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing. The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.<ref name=\"aitken227\">Aitken, p. 227.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| align = left\n| width = 22em\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = And David the king came and sat before the {{LORD}}, and said, Who ''am'' I, O {{LORD}} God, and what ''is'' mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people.<ref name=\"hindmarsh8\">Noll and Blumhofer, p. 8.</ref> Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratitude for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await.<ref>Turner, p. 81.</ref> Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly,<ref name=\"watson215\"/> and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were \"blinded by the god of this world\" until \"mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired&nbsp;... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace.\"<ref name=\"aitken227\"/>\n\nThe [[New Testament]] served as the basis for many of the lyrics of \"Amazing Grace\". The first verse, for example, can be traced to the story of the [[Prodigal Son]]. In the [[Gospel of Luke]] the father says, \"For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found\". The story of Jesus [[Miracles of Jesus#The blind|healing a blind man]] who tells the [[Pharisees]] that he can now see is told in the [[Gospel of John]]. Newton used the words \"I was blind but now I see\" and declared \"Oh to grace how great a debtor!\" in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752.<ref name=\"aitken228\">Aitken, p. 228.</ref> The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation \"Amazing grace!\", to be followed by a qualifying reply in \"how sweet the sound\". In ''An Annotated Anthology of Hymns'', Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called \"crude but effective\" in an overall composition that \"suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith\".<ref name=\"watson215\">Watson, p. 215.</ref> Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.<ref name=\"hindmarsh6\"/>\n\nThe sermon preached by Newton was his last of those that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental instability returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author of ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.<ref>Turner, p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:New Britain Southern Harmony Amazing Grace.jpg|thumb|450px|alt=Original long hymnal with shape note music notation of a tune titled \"New Britain\" set to Newton's first verse, with four subsequent verses printed below.

A tremendous religious movement swept the US in the early 19th century, marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start on the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended [[camp meeting]]s where they came to experience salvation; preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding.<ref name=\"turner115-116\">Turner, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref> Religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony, and made as plain and simple as possible; sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin. Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace.<ref name=\"hindmarsh10\"/> \"Amazing Grace\" was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAmazing grace! How sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me.\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nWas blind but now I see.\n\nShout, shout for glory,\nShout, shout aloud for glory;\nBrother, sister, mourner,\nAll shout glory hallelujah.<ref name=\"turner115-116\"/>\n</poem>}}\n\nSimultaneously, an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds to symbolise the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Other groups would sing outside, on benches set up in a square. Preachers used [[shape note]] hymns to teach people on the frontier and to raise the emotion of camp meetings. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung [[a cappella]].<ref>Turner, p. 117.</ref>\n\n[[File:William Walker, American composer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Grainy portrait of a middle aged white man in a black suit|[[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]], the American composer who first set John Newton's verses to the \"New Britain\" tune, creating version of the song known as \"Amazing Grace\"]]\n\n=== \"New Britain\" tune ===\nWhen originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry.

This was an amalgamation of two melodies (\"Gallaher\" and \"St. Mary\"), first published in the ''Columbian Harmony'' by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's [[Centre College]], compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\".

Shape-note singing communities, with all the members sitting around an open center, each song employing a different song leader, illustrated this in practice. Simultaneously, the US began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The \"dangers, toils, and snares\" of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans.<ref name=\"turner126\"/> This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). \"Amazing Grace\", set to \"New Britain\", was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers. With death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace.<ref>Turner, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> The hymn was translated into other languages as well: while on the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Cherokee]] sang Christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy, and a version of the song by [[Samuel Worcester]] that had been translated into the [[Cherokee language]] became very popular.<ref>Duvall, p. 35.</ref><ref>Swiderski, p. 91.</ref>\n\n=== Urban revival ===\nAlthough \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" was popular, other versions existed regionally. [[Primitive Baptist]]s in the Appalachian region often used \"New Britain\" with other hymns, and sometimes sing the words of \"Amazing Grace\" to other folk songs, including titles such as \"[[In the Pines]]\", \"Pisgah\", \"Primrose\", and \"Evan\", as all are able to be sung in common meter, of which the majority of their repertoire consists.<ref>Patterson, p. 137.</ref><ref>Sutton, Brett (January 1982). \"Shape-Note Tune Books and Primitive Hymns\", ''Ethnomusicology'', '''26''' (1), pp. 11\u201326.</ref> In the late 19th century, Newton's verses were sung to a tune named \"Arlington\" as frequently as to \"New Britain\" for a time.\n\nTwo musical arrangers named [[Dwight Moody]] and [[Ira Sankey]] heralded another religious revival in the cities of the US and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of [[gospel music]], and churches all over the US were eager to acquire them.<ref>Turner, pp. 133\u2013135.</ref> Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and \"Amazing Grace\" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the [[incipit]]s (first line of the lyrics), or the name of the tune such as \"New Britain\". Publisher [[Edwin Othello Excell]] gave the version of \"Amazing Grace\" set to \"New Britain\" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving \"New Britain\" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910. His  version of \"Amazing Grace\" became the standard form of the song in American churches.<ref>Noll and Blumhofer, p. 13.</ref><ref>Turner, pp. 137\u2013138, 140\u2013145.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Amazing grace2.ogg\n| title = \"Amazing Grace\" a cappella with hymn lining\n| description = This recording of three singers was done for the ''Archive of American Folk-Song'' in Livingston, Alabama, in 1939, and is in the U.S. Library of Congress.\n}}\n\n== Recorded versions ==\nWith the advent of recorded music and radio, \"Amazing Grace\" began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed \"Amazing Grace\" to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of \"Amazing Grace\" uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience.

Mahalia Jackson employed \"Amazing Grace\" for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it \"to give magical protection{{snd}} a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend&nbsp;...

Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album ''[[Whales & Nightingales]]''. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to \"pull her through\" to recovery.<ref name=\"moyers\"/> It was recorded in [[St. Paul's Chapel (Columbia University)|St. Paul's]], the chapel at [[Columbia University]], chosen for the acoustics. She chose an ''a cappella'' arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: \"I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought&nbsp;... but sing 'Amazing Grace'.\"<ref>Collins, p. 165.</ref> Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], remaining on the charts for 15 weeks,<ref>Whitburn, p. 144.</ref> as if, she wrote, her fans had been \"waiting to embrace it\".<ref>Collins, p. 166.</ref> In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts.<ref>Brown, Kutner, and Warwick p. 179.</ref> Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=731#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand \u2013 search listener]</ref> and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.<ref>[http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement The Irish Charts \u2013 All there is to know]</ref>\n\nAlthough Collins used it as a catharsis for her opposition to the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards#Pipes and Drums|Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]], senior [[Scottish regiment]] of the [[British Army]], recorded an instrumental version featuring a [[bagpipe]] soloist accompanied by a [[pipe band]]. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart in Canada for three weeks,<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.7697.pdf Top Singles{{snd}} Volume 17, No. 17] RPM Magazine. 10 June 1972.

Newton's [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] view of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] and [[Grace (Christianity)|divine grace]] formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was [[Total depravity|unable to change his life]] or be redeemed without God's help.

Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at [[Lincoln Center]], where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them.<ref name=\"pollock\">Pollock, John (2009). \"Amazing Grace: The great Sea Change in the Life of John Newton\", ''The Trinity Forum Reading'', The Trinity Forum.</ref> James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose \"Amazing Grace\" to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: \"there is a transformative power that is applicable&nbsp;... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature.\"<ref>Basker, p. xxxiv.</ref>\n\nMoyers interviewed Collins, Cash, opera singer [[Jessye Norman]], Appalachian folk musician [[Jean Ritchie]] and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the [[Huntsville Unit|Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville]]. Collins, Cash, and Norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday]], stated, \"I don't know whether it's the text{{snd}} I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people{{snd}} or whether it's that tune that everybody knows.\" A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: \"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved\" by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realised he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer [[Marion Williams]] summed up its effect: \"That's a song that gets to everybody\".<ref name=\"moyers\"/>\n\nThe ''Dictionary of American Hymnology'' claims it is included in more than a thousand published hymnals, and recommends its use for \"occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by God's grace alone; as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon; as a confession of faith or after the sermon\".<ref name=\"dah\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jonathan Aitken|Aitken, Jonathan]] (2007).
