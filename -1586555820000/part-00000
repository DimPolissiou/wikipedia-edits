It quickly [[viral video|goes viral]]. In the following months, it emerges that Wrinkles is a professional clown in [[Florida]] who offers his services to the parents of misbehaving children, showing up to frighten them unannounced as a deterrent to future bad behavior. Stickers bearing Wrinkles' face and phone number begin appearing all over Florida and thousands of people begin calling it for various reasons, from parents wanting to hire Wrinkles to people making death threats. Over the course of the next four years, Wrinkles becomes an object of folklore both locally in Florida and across the United States, with children routinely calling the number either alone or with friends as a sort of [[rite of passage]]. Additionally, further videos appear depicting Wrinkles either frightening people outside their homes or engaging in disturbing behavior, such as waving to motorists from a darkened roadside.\n\nIn 2019, Wrinkles agrees to allow a documentary crew to follow him in his daily life and explain his philosophy. Wrinkles is revealed as an elderly homeless man who lives in a van in the woods outside of [[Naples, Florida]] and spends much of his free time fishing, drinking, and going to [[strip clubs]], occasionally using the money he makes from his appearances as Wrinkles to check into motels. He claims to have no personal ideology and states that he only works as Wrinkles for the money. \n\nDiscussions with Wrinkles are intercut with interviews with a variety of individuals discussing the phenomenon, including a psychologist who debates whether Wrinkles' behavior is abusive; folklore experts who compare Wrinkles to a contemporary [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] and other mythic rituals that figure prominently in American adolescence; a historian who explores the history of the [[evil clown]] trope, tying it back to [[Punch and Judy]]; and a professional clown unhappy with the recent negative attention that Wrinkles and the remake of ''[[Stephen King's It]]'' have brought to the profession. The documentary crew further discusses Wrinkles with a number of children around America who have been impacted by his videos, from a young girl who wishes to fight him to an aspiring horror filmmaker inspired by Wrinkles' YouTube videos to begin conceptualizing his own movies. The documentary crew also examines the Wrinkles phenomenon in the context of the [[2016 Clown Sightings]]. \n\nMidway through the documentary it is revealed that the man the crew has been following is in fact an actor named D.B. Lambert, hired by the \"real\" Wrinkles, a Florida [[performance artist]], to portray Wrinkles' [[secret identity]]. Wrinkles explains that both characters were created as part of an elaborate art project. With his face blurred out, the real Wrinkles shows the documentary crew behind-the-scenes footage depicting the making of various Wrinkles videos; he further reveals that he has never actually gone to anyone's house, and that all the videos depicting Wrinkles frightening children were in fact made with the participation of actors. Wrinkles expresses satisfaction with the impact the project has had while contemplating its future, and the role it has had in contemporary American pop culture.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Benjamin Radford]] as himself<ref>{{cite web |title=Full Cast and Crew: Wrinkles the Clown (2019) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9097270/fullcredits/?ref_=m_ttfc_3 |website=IMDB.com |publisher=IMDB |accessdate=14 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* D.B.

The issue was whether a provincial statute which altered the contractual liabilities of a benevolent organization, reducing its financial obligations to two individuals, was within the constitutional authority of the province of Quebec under the ''British North America Act, 1867'' (now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'').\n\nIt was the first case where the Judicial Committee examined in detail the interplay between the list of federal powers in s. 91 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' and the list of provincial powers in s. 92 of the Act.<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-4.html#h-17 ''Constitution Act, 1867'', ss. 91, 92.]</ref>  The Judicial Committee held that the legislation was within provincial jurisdiction as a matter of local and private interest, coming under section 92(16) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.

One of its purposes was to provide annuities to surviving widows of its deceased members, as governed by the contract of membership.  However, it found that its annuity commitments exceeded its financial capacities, and if it made the payments as set out in the contract, it would run out of funds.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal|abbr =S.Q.|year =1869-70|chapter =58|link= https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=139877}}, Preamble</ref>\n\nTo deal with this problem, the Legislature of Quebec enacted ''An Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal''.  The Act authorised the Union to make block payments of $200 to each of the surviving widows, replacing the annuities, which were to have been paid at the rate of 7''s''. 6''d''. per week for life.  The Act also provided that if the Union's financial position improved, it then could make up the arrears owing to the widows under the original terms of the contract.<ref>''Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal'',  ss. 1-3.</ref>\n\nFollowing the passage of this Act, the Union voted to take advantage of its provisions. Two of the four widows eligible for benefits agreed to accept the block sum of $200 instead of the amounts provided under the contract.  The other two widows insisted on receiving the contractual benefits, and challenged the reduction in payments in the courts.\n\n==Decisions of the Quebec courts==\n\nThe two widows brought their action in the Circuit Court of Montreal.  As part of their court action, they challenged the constitutionality of the provincial Act which authorised the lower payments, arguing that it was not within provincial authority under s. 92 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  They argued that the provincial Act in fact dealt with \"Bankruptcy and Insolvency\", which are matters of exclusive federal jurisdiction under s. 91(21) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  In response, the Union argued that the Act was authorised by s. 92(16) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'', which gives the provinces power to legislate with respect to \"All Matters of a merely local and Private nature in the Province.\"\n\nOn 30 November 1870, the Circuit Court accepted the widows' argument and held that the Act was not within the constitutional authority of the Province.<ref>''L'Union St-Jacques de Montr\u00e9al v. B\u00e9lisle'' (1870), 15 L.C. Jur. 212 (C.S. Que.).</ref>  The Union then appealed to the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side).  On 20 September 1872, that Court dismissed the appeal, by a 3-2 majority (Duval C.J, Drummond and Monk JJ., Caron and Badgley JJ., dissenting).  The majority agreed that the Act dealt with bankruptcy and insolvency and was not within provincial jurisdiction.<ref>''L'Union St-Jacques de Montr\u00e9al v. B\u00e9lisle'' (1874), 5 R.L.O.S. 622, 20 L.C. Jur. 29 (B.R. Que.).</ref>\n\n== Decision of the Judicial Committee ==\n\nThe Union then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the [[Privy Council in Britain]], at that time the court of last resort for the colonies of the [[British Empire]], including Canada.  (There was no appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], as that court had not yet been created.)  The Union was represented by [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir W. Harcourt]], Q.C., and Mr Bompas.  The widows were represented by Mr [[Judah P. Benjamin]], Q.C., and F.W. Gibbs.\n\n[[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]] gave the decision for the Committee.  He ruled that the statute was constitutional, as a local and private matter, within provincial jurisdiction under s. 92(16) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  It dealt solely with the affairs of the Union, which operated in Montreal, and whose members were clearly within provincial jurisdiction.  The Act took note of a particular state of affairs of the Union and provided a remedy.  The subject matter of the Act was clearly local and private in nature.<ref>UKPC at p. 35</ref>\n\nBankruptcy and insolvency, on the other hand, is a general matter, providing a legal system for the administration of estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent.  The federal Parliament had not enacted any legislation under this head of power at the time of the events, and to suggest that the mere possibility that Parliament would enact such legislation in future should take the matter out of provincial jurisdiction \"... would go very far to destroy that [provincial] power in all cases.\"<ref>UKPC at pp. 36-37</ref> Lord Selborne went on to describe the extent to which the federal power could reach:\n\n{{cquote|\nThe words describe in their own legal sense provisions made by law for the administration of the estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent, according to rules and definitions prescribed by law, including of course the conditions in which that law is to be brought into operation, the manner in which it is to be brought into operation, and the effect of its operation.\n}}\n\nLord Selborne noted that there was no proof that the Union was insolvent, and in fact the tendency of the Act was to keep it from becoming insolvent.  Nor did the provincial Act terminate the Union, wind it up, or distribute its assets to its creditors.  The provincial Act therefore did not deal with bankruptcy and insolvency and did not intrude on federal jurisdiction.<ref>UKPC at pp. 37-38</ref>\n\nHe concluded that the Committee should advise Her Majesty that the appeal be allowed and the original suit be dismissed, with no order as to costs.<ref>UKPC at p. 38</ref>\n\n== Significance of the decision ==\n\n''Union St Jacques de Montreal v B\u00e9lisle''  was the first case in which the Judicial Committee gave any detailed analysis of the interplay between s. 91 and s. 92 of the ''Constitution Act 1867'', which are at the heart of the constitutional [[Canadian federalism|division of powers]] between the federal government and the provinces in Canada.  (In a previous case, ''[[R v Coote]]'', the Judicial Committee had dismissed a constitutional challenge to a provincial statute, but the Committee did not give any detailed reasons on the constitutional point.)\n\nLord Selborne's definition of the bankruptcy and insolvency power has been described in later jurisprudence as declaring that the Parliament of Canada \"has a very wide discretion and is not necessarily limited in the exercise of that discretion by reference to the particular provisions of bankruptcy legislation in England prior to the date of the BNA Act.\"<ref>{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference re legislative jurisdiction of Parliament of Canada to enact the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, as amended by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, 1935|link=|year=1936|court=scc|num=35|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 389|parallelcite=[1936] SCR 384|date=1936-06-17|courtname=auto|juris=}}</ref>\n\nThe federal Department of Justice included this decision in the three volume collection of constitutional decisions of the Judicial Committee which the Department published when appeals to the Judicial Committee were abolished.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last= Olmsted|editor-first= Richard A.|date= 1954|title= Decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council relating to the British North America Act, 1867 and the Canadian Constitution, 1867-1954|url= |location= Ottawa|publisher= Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery|volume=I|page= 11|isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Union St Jacques de Montreal v Belisle}}\n[[Category:Canadian federalism case law]]\n[[Category:Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from Canada]]\n[[Category:1874 in Canadian case law]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox court case\n|name               = L'Union St Jacques de Montreal v B\u00e9lisle\n|court              = [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]\n|image              = British North America Act, 1867.jpg\n|imagesize          = \n|imagelink          = \n|imagealt           = \n|caption            = \n|full name          = L'Union St-Jacques de Montreal v Dame Julie B\u00e9lisle\n|date decided       = July 8, 1874\n|citations          = [1874] UKPC 53, (1874) 6 L.R.

One of its purposes was to provide annuities to surviving widows of its deceased members, as governed by the contract of membership.  However, it found that its annuity commitments exceeded its financial capacities, and if it made the payments as set out in the contract, it would run out of funds.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal|abbr =S.Q.|year =1869-70|chapter =58|link= https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=139877}}, Preamble</ref>\n\nTo deal with this problem, the Legislature of Quebec enacted ''An Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal''.  The Act authorised the Union to make block payments of $200 to each of the surviving widows, replacing the annuities, which were to have been paid at the rate of 7''s''. 6''d''. per week for life.  The Act also provided that if the Union's financial position improved, it then could make up the arrears owing to the widows under the original terms of the contract.<ref>''Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal'',  ss. 1-3.</ref>\n\nFollowing the passage of this Act, the Union voted to take advantage of its provisions. Two of the four widows eligible for benefits agreed to accept the block sum of $200 instead of the amounts provided under the contract.  The other two widows insisted on receiving the contractual benefits, and challenged the reduction in payments in the courts.\n\n==Decisions of the Quebec Courts==\n\nThe two widows brought their action in the Circuit Court of Montreal.  As part of their court action, they challenged the constitutionality of the provincial Act which authorised the lower payments, arguing that it was not within provincial authority under s. 92 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  They argued that the provincial Act in fact dealt with \"Bankruptcy and Insolvency\", which are matters of exclusive federal jurisdiction under s. 91(21) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  In response, the Union argued that the Act was authorised by s. 92(16) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'', which gives the provinces power to legislate with respect to \"All Matters of a merely local and Private nature in the Province.\"\n\nOn 30 November 1870, the Circuit Court accepted the widows' argument and held that the Act was not within the constitutional authority of the Province.<ref>''L'Union St-Jacques de Montr\u00e9al v. B\u00e9lisle'' (1870), 15 L.C. Jur. 212 (C.S. Que.).</ref>  The Union then appealed to the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side).  On 20 September 1872, that Court dismissed the appeal, by a 3-2 majority (Duval C.J, Drummond and Monk JJ., Caron and Badgley JJ., dissenting).  The majority agreed that the Act dealt with bankruptcy and insolvency and was not within provincial jurisdiction.<ref>''L'Union St-Jacques de Montr\u00e9al v. B\u00e9lisle'' (1874), 5 R.L.O.S. 622, 20 L.C. Jur. 29 (B.R. Que.).</ref>\n\n== Decision of the Judicial Committee ==\n\nThe Union then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the [[Privy Council in Britain]], at that time the court of last resort for the colonies of the [[British Empire]], including Canada.  (There was no appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], as that court had not yet been created.)  The Union was represented by [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir W. Harcourt]], Q.C., and Mr Bompas.  The widows were represented by Mr [[Judah P. Benjamin]], Q.C., and F.W. Gibbs.\n\n[[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]] gave the decision for the Committee.  He ruled that the statute was constitutional, as a local and private matter, within provincial jurisdiction under s. 92(16) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.  It dealt solely with the affairs of the Union, which operated in Montreal, and whose members were clearly within provincial jurisdiction.  The Act took note of a particular state of affairs of the Union and provided a remedy.  The subject matter of the Act was clearly local and private in nature.<ref>UKPC at p. 35</ref>\n\nBankruptcy and insolvency, on the other hand, is a general matter, providing a legal system for the administration of estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent.  The federal Parliament had not enacted any legislation under this head of power at the time of the events, and to suggest that the mere possibility that Parliament would enact such legislation in future should take the matter out of provincial jurisdiction \"... would go very far to destroy that [provincial] power in all cases.\"<ref>UKPC at pp. 36-37</ref> Lord Selborne went on to describe the extent to which the federal power could reach:\n\n{{cquote|\nThe words describe in their own legal sense provisions made by law for the administration of the estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent, according to rules and definitions prescribed by law, including of course the conditions in which that law is to be brought into operation, the manner in which it is to be brought into operation, and the effect of its operation.\n}}\n\nLord Selborne noted that there was no proof that the Union was insolvent, and in fact the tendency of the Act was to keep it from becoming insolvent.  Nor did the provincial Act terminate the Union, wind it up, or distribute its assets to its creditors.  The provincial Act therefore did not deal with bankruptcy and insolvency and did not intrude on federal jurisdiction.<ref>UKPC at pp. 37-38</ref>\n\nHe concluded that the Committee should advise Her Majesty that the appeal be allowed and the original suit be dismissed, with no order as to costs.<ref>UKPC at p. 38</ref>\n\n== Significance of the decision ==\n\n''Union St Jacques de Montreal v B\u00e9lisle''  was the first case in which the Judicial Committee gave any detailed analysis of the interplay between s. 91 and s. 92 of the ''Constitution Act 1867'', which are at the heart of the constitutional [[Canadian federalism|division of powers]] between the federal government and the provinces in Canada.  (In a previous case, ''[[R v Coote]]'', the Judicial Committee had dismissed a constitutional challenge to a provincial statute, but the Committee did not give any detailed reasons on the constitutional point.)\n\nLord Selborne's definition of the bankruptcy and insolvency power has been described in later jurisprudence as declaring that the Parliament of Canada \"has a very wide discretion and is not necessarily limited in the exercise of that discretion by reference to the particular provisions of bankruptcy legislation in England prior to the date of the BNA Act.\"<ref>{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference re legislative jurisdiction of Parliament of Canada to enact the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, as amended by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, 1935|link=|year=1936|court=scc|num=35|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 389|parallelcite=[1936] SCR 384|date=1936-06-17|courtname=auto|juris=}}</ref>\n\nThe federal Department of Justice included this decision in the three volume collection of constitutional decisions of the Judicial Committee which the Department published when appeals to the Judicial Committee were abolished.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last= Olmsted|editor-first= Richard A.|date= 1954|title= Decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council relating to the British North America Act, 1867 and the Canadian Constitution, 1867-1954|url= |location= Ottawa|publisher= Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery|volume=I|page= 11|isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Union St Jacques de Montreal v Belisle}}\n[[Category:Canadian federalism case law]]\n[[Category:Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from Canada]]\n[[Category:1874 in Canadian case law]]\n", "name_user": "Mr Serjeant Buzfuz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDecisions of the Quebec Courts:copy-edit heading;  sentence case", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_St_Jacques_de_Montreal_v_B%C3%A9lisle"}

After his 2nd period of hospital treatment he returned to the 3rd Battalion, on 23 January 1918, before being posted to the 12th Battalion on 15 March 1918, where he remained until 26 July 1918. On 26 July 1918 Tandey transferred from the Green Howards to [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|The Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment)]]. He was posted to their [[Huddersfield Rifles|5th Battalion]] on 27 July 1918.\n\n===Distinguished Conduct Medal===\nOn 28 August 1918, during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|2nd Battle of Cambrai]], the 5th Battalion was in action to the west of the [[Canal du Nord]]. Tandey was in charge of one of several bombing parties on the German trenches. As the forward parties were being held up Tandey took two men and dashed across open ground ([[No man's land]]) under fire and bombed a trench. He returned with twenty prisoners. This action led to the capture of the German positions and Tandey was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] (DCM) on 5 December 1918, the citation read:\n\n{{quote|34506 Pte. H.

In the evening, he and eight comrades were surrounded by an overwhelming number of the enemy. Tandey led a [[bayonet]] charge, fighting so fiercely that 37 of the enemy were driven into the hands of the remainder of his company.

I witnessed the whole of the gallantry of Private Tandey throughout the day. Under intensely heavy fire he crawled forward in the village when we were held up by the enemy MG and found where it was, and then led myself and comrades with the gun into a house from where we were able to bring Lewis gun fire on the MG and knock it out of action. Later when we got to the canal crossings and the bridge was down, Pte Tandey, under the fiercest of aimed MG fire went forward and replaced planks over the bad part of the bridge to enable us all to cross without delay, which would otherwise have ensued. On the same evening when we made another attack we were completely surrounded by Germans, and we thought the position might be lost. Pte Tandey, without hesitation, though he was twice wounded very nastily, took the leading part in our bayonet charge on the enemy, to get clear.

When, during the advance on Marcoing, his platoon was held up by machine-gun fire, he at once crawled forward, located the machine gun, and, with a Lewis gun team, knocked it out. On arrival at the crossings he restored the plank bridge under a hail of bullets, thus enabling the first crossing to be made at this vital spot.\n\nLater in the evening, during an attack, he, with eight comrades, was surrounded by an overwhelming number of Germans, and though the position was apparently hopeless, he led a bayonet charge through them, fighting so fiercely that 37 of the enemy were driven into the hands of the remainder of his company.\n\nAlthough twice wounded, he refused to leave till the fight was won.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31067|supp=y|page=14778|date=13 December 1918}}</ref>}}\n\n===Hitler incident===\nAlthough disputed, [[Adolf Hitler]] and Tandey allegedly encountered each other at the French village of [[Marcoing]]. The story is set on 28 September 1918, while Tandey was serving with the 5th Duke of Wellington's Regiment, and relates that a weary German soldier wandered into Tandey's line of fire. The enemy soldier was wounded and did not even attempt to raise his own rifle. Tandey chose not to shoot. The German soldier saw him lower his rifle and nodded his thanks before wandering off. That soldier is purported to have been Adolf Hitler.<ref>{{cite web|title=World War I  1918 British soldier allegedly spares the life of an injured Adolf Hitler|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-soldier-allegedly-spares-the-life-of-an-injured-adolf-hitler|website=This Day in History|publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=TheTimes>{{cite news|last1=Morpurgo|first1=Michael |title=Michael Morpurgo on the soldier who could have stopped a world war with one shot| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/fiction/article4572177.ece|accessdate=3 October 2015| publisher=The Times Newspaper|date=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref name = RightWrong>{{cite web|last1=Godl|first1=John|title=How a Right Can Make a Wrong|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/features/tandey.htm|website=FirstWorldWar.com|date = 22 August 2009|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref> The author David Johnson, who wrote a book on Henry Tandey,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=One Soldier and Hitler, 1918: The Story of Henry Tandey VC DCM MM|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Spellmount Publishers Ltd|isbn=978-0752466132}}</ref> believes this story was an [[urban legend]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Did British soldier spare Hitler's life in WWI?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-26374583|accessdate=3 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=2 March  2014}}</ref>\n\nHitler apparently saw a newspaper report about Tandey being awarded the VC (in October 1918, whilst serving with the 5th Battalion Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment), recognized him, and clipped the article.<ref name = RightWrong/>\n\nIn 1937, Hitler was made aware of a particular [[Fortunino Matania]] painting<ref>http://victoriacross.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/tandey.jpg</ref> by Dr Otto Schwend, a member of his staff. Schwend had been a medical officer during the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in 1914. He had been sent a copy of the painting by a Lieutenant Colonel Earle in 1936. Earle had been treated by Schwend in a medical post at the [[Menen|Menin]] Crossroads and they remained in touch after the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|page=149}}</ref>\n\nThe painting was commissioned by the Green Howards Regiment from the Italian artist in 1923, showing a soldier purported to be Tandey carrying a wounded man at the Kruiseke Crossroads in 1914, northwest of Menin. The painting was made from a sketch, provided to Matania, by the regiment, based on an actual event at that crossroads. A building shown behind Tandey in the painting belonged to the Van Den Broucke family, who were presented with a copy of the painting by the Green Howard's Regiment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|pages= 149\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nSchwend obtained a large photo of the painting. Captain Weidemann, Hitler's [[adjutant]], wrote the following response:\n\n{{quote|I beg to acknowledge your friendly gift which has been sent to Berlin through the good offices of Dr. Schwend. The F\u00fchrer is naturally very interested in things connected with his own war experiences, and he was obviously moved when I showed him the photograph and explained the thought which you had in causing it to be sent to him. He was obviously moved when I showed him the picture. He has directed me to send you his best thanks for your friendly gift which is so rich in memories.}}\n\nApparently Hitler identified the soldier carrying the wounded man as Tandey from the photo of him in the newspaper clipping he had obtained in 1918.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/nostalgia/|title=Nostalgia: Latest Nostalgia pieces from Teesside Live|website=www.gazettelive.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, when [[Neville Chamberlain]] visited Hitler at his alpine retreat, the [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]], for the discussions that led to the [[Munich Agreement]], he noticed the painting and asked about it.

Hitler replied: <blockquote>That man came so near to killing me that I thought I should never see Germany again; Providence saved me from such devilishly accurate fire as those English boys were aiming at us.<ref name=\"Johnson 2012 150\">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|page=150}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the story, Hitler asked Chamberlain to convey his best wishes and gratitude to Tandey. Chamberlain promised to phone Tandey in person on his return, which apparently he did. The Cadbury Research Centre, which holds copies of Chamberlain's papers and diaries, has no references relating to Tandey from the records of the 1938 meeting.<ref>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/cadbury/documents/personal-archives-guide.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|page=146}}</ref> The story further states that the phone was answered by a nine-year-old child called William Whateley.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|page=144}}</ref> William was related to Tandey's wife Edith. However, Tandey at that time lived at 22 Cope Street, Coventry, and worked for the [[Triumph Motor Company]]. According to the company records, they only had three phone lines, none of which was at Tandey's address.

Hitler took his second leave from military service on 10 September 1918 for 18 days.

Three days later (18 March 1919) he was promoted to acting [[lance corporal]]. He remained with the 3rd Battalion on 'Home Service' until 4 February 1921, when he transferred to the 2nd Battalion. Four days later on 8 February 1921 he requested to revert to the rank of private.\n\nTandey served with the 2nd Battalion in Gibraltar from 11 April 1922 to 18 February 1923, in Turkey from 19 February \u2013 23 August 1923 and finally in Egypt from 24 August 1923 until 29 September 1925. He was finally discharged from the army on 5 January 1926.\n\nIn addition to his major awards Tandey had also been [[Mentioned in Despatches]] on five occasions. He was personally decorated by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 17 December 1919.<ref name=\"firstworldwar.com\"/>\n\n==Post-war years==\nTandey returned to Leamington and married. In 1940, during the [[Coventry Blitz]], his home was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]]. A journalist approached him outside his bombed Coventry home, asking him about his alleged encounter with Hitler. \"If only I had known what he would turn out to be,\" Tandey is quoted as saying. \"When I saw all the people and women and children he had killed and wounded I was sorry to God I let him go.\" However, there is no evidence, not even anecdotal, he was either hounded or avoided after the claims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-28593256|title=War hero who did not shoot Hitler|first=Bethan|last=Bell|date=4 August 2014|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nTandey became a Police sergeant at the Standard Triumph Works, Fletchamstead a position he held for 38 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.triumphworks.co.uk/|title=Standard Triumph Works Directory \u2013 Documenting Employees of the Standard and Triumph Works}}</ref>\n\nTandey died in 1977, childless, at the age of 86.

Unaware that the medals should have been returned to the museum, the medals were auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] in London by his wife and a private collector subsequently purchased them. They were presented to the [[Green Howards Regimental Museum]] (the regiment in which he had earlier served), by [[Ernest Harrison|Sir Ernest Harrison OBE]], at a ceremony in the [[Tower of London]] on 11 November 1997, twenty years after Tandey died.<ref name=1WWHT>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/features/tandey.htm|title=Henry Tandy|publisher=firstworldwar.com|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>\n\nA copy of Tandey's Victoria Cross is now displayed at the Green Howards Regimental Museum in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]].
