The parents Andre and Bokkie Meintjies were jailed in 1994\u2013 (this was the year Mandela was elected as President of South Africa), and their children were placed in separate orphanages while the parents were jailed at correctional facilities very far from each other and the children to prevent family contact, because they educated their children at home. However, a few years later, the Mandela government legalised home education with the publication of the South African School Act in 1996. Since it was legalised, homeschooling has the fastest growing education model in the country.\n\nHomeschooling is legal according to [[South Africa]]n national law, but individual provinces have the authority to set their own restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/SouthAfrica/default.asp |title=Home Schooling - South Africa |publisher=HSLDA |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> The SA Schools Act (art. 51) requires parents to register their children for education at home. In practice however, most provincial departments do not have the administrative capability to register children for home education. Some of the larger provincial departments have limited administrative capabilities to register children for home education as well as a lack of follow up capacity, resulting in a serious miscommunication between government and citizens. As a result of this situation, more than 90% of homeschooling parents do not register with the department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuisskolers.org |title=SA Homeschoolers - Blog Articles |website=Tuisskolers.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\nSince home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially.

Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state.  Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education.<ref name=\" Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\">Deani Neven Van Pelt (2015).

The child is required to enroll into a local school (public or private) and pass an annual exam in certain subjects (mother tongue and math only in lower grades; with addition of foreign language in middle grades and more subjects in higher grades). If the child does not pass all the exams in two attempts, it is ordered to continue the education with regular school attendance. Every year the parents have to notify the school by the end of May that they will be educating their child at home.\n\nLike in the case of [[#Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[#Montenegro|Montenegro]], the proposed model does not impose any limitation on who can home educate.<ref>[http://www.druginacin.hr/clanci/sluzbeno-ocitovanje-mzos-a-o-legalizaciji-obrazovanja-kod-kuce/ \"Slu\u017ebeno o\u010ditovanje MZO\u0160-a o legalizaciji obrazovanja kod ku\u0107e\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706092956/http://www.druginacin.hr/clanci/sluzbeno-ocitovanje-mzos-a-o-legalizaciji-obrazovanja-kod-kuce/ |date=2011-07-06 }} (hr), druginacin.hr</ref> The parents educating their children at home are ''not'' eligible to receive any kind of state help. The schools are free to choose whether they will allow special arrangements with children educated at home (flexi-schooling, the use of school resources, participation in field trips and other school activities, etc.). The Ministry of Education and schools are ''not'' required to provide any form of help to parents of children educated at home (teacher guides, worksheets, consultation, etc.).\n\nThe proposed model was chosen as it requires minimal change to the existing law and would be possible to implement within the current educational framework. The Croatian Constitution,<ref>[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/232289.html Ustav Republike Hrvatske] (hr), Croatian Constitution, 25 April 2001, Article 63 paragraph 1 and Article 65 paragraph 1</ref> in the Article 63 paragraph 1, states that parents have a duty to ''school'' their children. Similarly, in the Article 65 paragraph 1, it states that primary ''schooling'' is compulsory and free. It is deeply ingrained in Croatian culture that education cannot happen without schooling.\n\nAs of July 2011 there are three alternative primary schools in Croatia \u2013 one Montessori<ref>[http://www.montessori-skola.hr/ Osnovna Montessori \u0161kola \"Barunice D\u00e9d\u00e9e Vranyczany\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211704/http://www.montessori-skola.hr/ |date=2011-09-01 }} (hr), Zagreb</ref> and two Steiner Waldorf schools.<ref>[http://www.waldorfska-skola.com/ Waldorfska \u0161kola u Zagrebu] (hr), Zagreb</ref><ref>[http://www.waldorf-rijeka.hr/ Osnovna waldorfska \u0161kola u Rijeci] (hr), Rijeka</ref> Alternative schools in Croatia are required to follow national curriculum<ref name=hr-zakon-skola /> (Article 26 paragraph 1, Article 30).\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n: ''Status: '''Legal'''''\nThe Ministry of Education began an experiment on September 1, 1998 in which home education was made a legal alternative for students in the first five years of elementary school. In 2004 home education, referred to as Individual Education, was enshrined in the Education Act for children within that age group.

So annual inspection is achieved first time at the age of 3. Probably from september 2020 compulsory education will rise to age of 18.\n\nEvery other two years, the social welfare, mandated by the mayor, verifies the reasons the family home educates and controls that the training provided is consistent with the health of the child. Parents will also be subject to annual inspections if they are teaching children between the ages of 6 and 16. Two consecutive unsatisfactory outcomes of these inspections can mean the parents will have to send their children to a mainstream school.\n\nWhile homeschooling parents are free to teach their children in any way they like, the children must remain every year at a skill level that complies with high probability to master the seven key competencies of the common foundation of competence at the end of the legal obligation (age 16).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/3/46/0/instruction_famille_204460.pdf |format=PDF |title=B.O.

Many states developed school systems before and with the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] some reforms were proposed. In the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country. The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. This is one of the few Nazi laws that is followed in present-day Germany.\n\nIn 1989, Helmut St\u00fccher removed his children from the public school system to begin homeschooling. St\u00fccher and others who followed suit were fined, and some even lost child custody.<ref>J.D., 2010. HOMESCHOOLING IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES. James E.

The European Court took the position that the plaintiffs were the children, not their parents, and declared \"children are unable to foresee the consequences of their parents' decision for home education because of their young age....

The parents Andre and Bokkie Meintjies were jailed in 1994\u2013 (this was the year Mandela was elected as President of South Africa), and their children were placed in separate orphanages while the parents were jailed at correctional facilities very far from each other and the children to prevent family contact, because they educated their children at home. However, a few years later, the Mandela government legalised home education with the publication of the South African School Act in 1996. Since it was legalised, homeschooling has the fastest growing education model in the country.\n\nHomeschooling is legal according to [[South Africa]]n national law, but individual provinces have the authority to set their own restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/SouthAfrica/default.asp |title=Home Schooling - South Africa |publisher=HSLDA |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> The SA Schools Act (art. 51) requires parents to register their children for education at home. In practice however, most provincial departments do not have the administrative capability to register children for home education. Some of the larger provincial departments have limited administrative capabilities to register children for home education as well as a lack of follow up capacity, resulting in a serious miscommunication between government and citizens. As a result of this situation, more than 90% of homeschooling parents do not register with the department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuisskolers.org |title=SA Homeschoolers - Blog Articles |website=Tuisskolers.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\nSince home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially.

Some provinces have implemented policies that require parents to notify school boards of their decision to homeschool.  Every province requires parents to notify the school system of their intent to withdraw their child from the public school system and to begin home education.  Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state.  Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education.<ref name=\" Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\">Deani Neven Van Pelt (2015). Home Schooling in Canada: The Current Picture\u20142015 Edition. Barbara Mitchell Centre for Improvement in Education.

Despite a positive environment that supports and encourages alternatives to traditional schooling, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of Canadian families were homeschooling in 2015.

For those children whose parents decided to homeschool out of a desire to better education, a 2003 study found statistical significance between traditionally schooled and homeschooled students scores on standardized tests of writing, reading, and mathematics.

Many states developed school systems before and with the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] some reforms were proposed. In the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country. The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. This is one of the few Nazi laws that is followed in present-day Germany.\n\nIn 1989, Helmut St\u00fccher removed his children from the public school system to begin homeschooling.

It is estimated that over two thousand German soldiers, including numerous teenagers, under the command of German officers but against the [[Geneva Conventions]], removed mines, nearly half of them being either killed or wounded. The removal was part of a controversial agreement between the German Commander General [[Georg Lindemann]], the Danish Government and the British Armed Forces, under which German soldiers with experience in defusing mines would be in charge of clearing the mine fields. Historians have criticised the film for showing German soldiers clearing mines under the command of Danish officers, which never happened.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNDER SANDET - NY FILM AF MARTIN ZANDVLIET|url=http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/FILMupdate/2014/Juni/Under-sandet-ny-film-af-Martin-Zandvliet.aspx#|accessdate=9 November 2015|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://politiken.dk/kultur/art5601303/Historiker-roser-Under-Sandet-selv-om-der-skrues-%C2%BBliiige-lovligt-meget-p%C3%A5-drama-knappen%C2%AB|title=Historiker roser 'Under Sandet' selv om der skrues \u00bbliiige lovligt meget p\u00e5 drama-knappen\u00ab|first=Eva Lange J\u00f8rgensen|last=Journalist|date=3 December 2015|website=Politiken|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and the [[liberation of Denmark]] from [[German occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] in May 1945, the defeated ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' evacuates the country.

Rasmussen forces the boys to perform the dangerous work with their bare hands. They are warned not to expect any sympathy from the Danes, who resent their former occupiers. Rasmussen shares this contempt and he is determined to treat the young prisoners without sympathy.\n\nRasmussen is rude to and contemptuous of them and the neighbouring household treats them with hostility. After marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour for a total of 45,000 mines. Rasmussen begins to grow conflicted in his feelings and Sebastian Schumann, leader of the boys, attempts to remain optimistic; the boys discuss their plans for when they return home.\n\nThe POWs are not given food due to postwar shortages and some begin to suffer from [[malnourishment]]. The optimistic Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he dies in a [[field hospital]]. After stealing animal fodder from the nearby farm, the boys are poisoned by rat droppings and Rasmussen forces them to purge themselves with seawater. Afterwards, he begins to treat them more kindly, stealing food from the base for them and reporting that Wilhelm has survived, to maintain morale. He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. While clearing the beach, one of the boys forgets to separate a mine's plunger from the detonator.  After Rasmussen stops a group of Allied soldiers from urinating on one of the boys, Ebbe accuses him of being sympathetic towards the Germans. Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another and his twin brother, Ernst, who is in [[denial]], is comforted by Rasmussen.\n\nAfter a casual game of [[soccer|football]], Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly safe zone of the beach.  This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march close together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. He relents after seeing Ernst save a little girl from the minefield and then commit suicide by walking onto uncleared sand.  He reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to return. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach of mines, a live mine is accidentally tossed onto a truckload of deactivated mines, setting off a massive chain reaction and killing the other seven. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain.\n\nAlthough the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, Ebbe informs Rasmussen that he has ordered the surviving four to be sent to another area, to join a team defusing landmines without the aid of a map. Rasmussen argues with Ebbe but he refuses to rescind the order. Rasmussen rescues them, drives them within 500 meters of the [[Denmark\u2013Germany border|German border]] and orders them to run to their freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Roland M\u00f8ller]] as Sgt.

It is estimated that over two thousand German soldiers, including numerous teenagers, under the command of German officers but against the [[Geneva Conventions]], removed mines, nearly half of them being either killed or wounded. The removal was part of a controversial agreement between the German Commander General [[Georg Lindemann]], the Danish Government and the British Armed Forces, under which German soldiers with experience in defusing mines would be in charge of clearing the mine fields. Historians have criticised the film for showing German soldiers clearing mines under the command of Danish officers, which never happened.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNDER SANDET - NY FILM AF MARTIN ZANDVLIET|url=http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/FILMupdate/2014/Juni/Under-sandet-ny-film-af-Martin-Zandvliet.aspx#|accessdate=9 November 2015|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://politiken.dk/kultur/art5601303/Historiker-roser-Under-Sandet-selv-om-der-skrues-%C2%BBliiige-lovligt-meget-p%C3%A5-drama-knappen%C2%AB|title=Historiker roser 'Under Sandet' selv om der skrues \u00bbliiige lovligt meget p\u00e5 drama-knappen\u00ab|first=Eva Lange J\u00f8rgensen|last=Journalist|date=3 December 2015|website=Politiken|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and the [[liberation of Denmark]] from [[German occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] in May 1945, the defeated ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' evacuates the country. A Danish sergeant, Carl Leopold Rasmussen, furiously beats up a German [[prisoner of war]] for carrying a [[Flag of Denmark|Danish flag]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/danish-postwar-drama-land-of-mine-tells-a-little-known-story/article34048206/|title=Danish postwar drama Land of Mine tells a little known story|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> A group of young German prisoners are handed over to the [[Royal Danish Army|Danish Army]] and sent to the [[Atlantic Wall|west coast]], where they are trained to [[Demining|remove the mines]] that the Germans had buried in the sand. Rasmussen forces the boys to perform the dangerous work with their bare hands. They are warned not to expect any sympathy from the Danes, who resent their former occupiers. Rasmussen shares this contempt and he is determined to treat the young prisoners without sympathy.\n\nRasmussen is rude to and contemptuous of them and the neighbouring household treats them with hostility. After marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour for a total of 45,000 mines. Rasmussen begins to grow conflicted in his feelings and Sebastian Schumann, leader of the boys, attempts to remain optimistic; the boys discuss their plans for when they return home.\n\nThe POWs are not given food due to postwar shortages and some begin to suffer from [[malnourishment]]. The optimistic Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he dies in a [[field hospital]]. After stealing animal fodder from the nearby farm, the boys are poisoned by rat droppings and Rasmussen forces them to purge themselves with seawater. Afterwards, he begins to treat them more kindly, stealing food from the base for them and reporting that Wilhelm has survived, to maintain morale. He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. While clearing the beach, one of the boys forgets to separate a mine's plunger from the detonator.  After Rasmussen stops a group of Allied soldiers from urinating on one of the boys, Ebbe accuses him of being sympathetic towards the Germans. Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another and his twin brother, Ernst, who is in [[denial]], is comforted by Rasmussen.\n\nAfter a casual game of [[soccer|football]], Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly safe zone of the beach.  This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march close together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. He relents after seeing Ernst save a little girl from the minefield and then commit suicide by walking onto uncleared sand.  He reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to return. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach of mines, a live mine is accidentally tossed onto a truckload of deactivated mines, setting off a massive chain reaction and killing the other seven. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain.\n\nAlthough the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, Ebbe informs Rasmussen that he has ordered the surviving four to be sent to another area, to join a team defusing landmines without the aid of a map. Rasmussen argues with Ebbe but he refuses to rescind the order. Rasmussen rescues them, drives them within 500 meters of the [[Denmark\u2013Germany border|German border]] and orders them to run to their freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Roland M\u00f8ller]] as Sgt.

in support of the [[Egyptian Army]], [[Egyptian Navy]] and the [[Egyptian Air Defense Forces]].  The latter was created as a separate command in the 1970s and it coordinates with the Air Force to integrate air and ground-based air defense operations. The EAF is headed by an [[Air Marshal]] ([[Lieutenant General]] equivalent).  Currently, the commander of the Egyptian Air Force is Air Marshal [[Mohamed Abbas]]. The force's [[motto]] is 'Higher and higher for the sake of glory' ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062f}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|I\u2018la\u2019 al-'ol\u00e0 f\u012b sab\u012bl al-magd}}'').\n\nThe Egyptian Army Air Service was formed in 1932, and became an independent air force in 1937. It had little involvement in the [[Second World War]]. From 1948 to 1973 it took part, with generally mediocre results, in four separate wars with Israel, as well as the quasi-[[War of Attrition]]. It also supported the [[Egyptian Army]] during the [[North Yemen Civil War]] and the [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War]] of 1977.  From 1977 to 2011 it saw virtually no combat, but has participated in numerous exercises, including [[Operation Bright Star]]. Since 1992 the EAF has also provided aviation support for the [[Egyptian National Police|police]] and other national security organizations engaged in the war against terrorism. In recent years the Air Force has acted in the [[Sinai insurgency]], the [[Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)|Second Libyan Civil War]] and the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Intervention in the Yemen]].\n\nThe EAF primary role is the air defence of the nation, with secondary tasks of strike and army support operations. The EAF provides official government transport and carries out international search-and- rescue operations in the desert, the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and the [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn 2014 the IISS estimated the total active manpower of the Egyptian Air Force at approximately 30,000 personnel, including 10,000 conscripts, with reserves of 20,000 personnel.<ref name=IISS2014/> This contrasts with an estimate of some 35,000 personnel, with most aircrew being long-term professionals, in 2010.<ref name=IISS2014/><ref name=\"Ripley\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMq7fhIe-yYC&pg=PA65|title=Middle East Air Power in the 21st Century|last=Ripley|first=Tim|publisher=Casemate Publishers|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84884-099-7|page=65}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment===\nIn late 1928, the [[Parliament of Egypt]] proposed the creation of an Egyptian Air Force. The Egyptian ministry of war announced that it needed volunteers for the new arm to become the first four Egyptian military pilots. Over 200 Egyptian officers volunteered, but in the end only three succeeded in passing strict medical tests and technical examinations.\n\nThese three went to [[No. 4 Flying Training School RAF]] at [[RAF Abu Sueir|RAF Station Abu Sueir]] near the [[Suez Canal]], where they were trained on a variety of aircraft. After graduation, they traveled to the United Kingdom for specialised training.\n[[File:First 3 egyptian pilots.jpg|thumb|upright|First three Egyptian pilots]]\nOn 2 November 1930, the King of Egypt and Sudan, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] announced the creation of the '''Egyptian Army Air Force''' (EAAF). On 27 May 1931 the Egyptian Council of Ministers approved the purchase of five aircraft and the building of an airfield at Almaza (Cairo) with a budget of 50,000 pounds. The aircraft chosen was the British [[de Havilland Gipsy Moth]] trainer, the five modified aircraft were flown from England to Egypt and on arrival in May 1932 the air force was founded and the Almaza airfield was formally opened.\n\nThe first commander of the EAAF was Squadron Leader [[Victor Hubert Tait]] RAF, a [[Canadians|Canadian]], former Senior Air Advisor on the British Military Mission in Egypt. Tait selected staff, weapons and initiated building a number of airfields. In 1934 the British government provided ten [[Avro 626]] aircraft, which were the first real Egyptian military planes. A further 17 626s together with [[Hawker Audax]]es for army cooperation and close support and [[Avro Anson]]s for VIP work followed shortly afterward.\n\nIn 1937 the Egyptian Army Air Force was separated from the Army Command and became an independent branch named the '''Royal Egyptian Air Force''' (REAF). New stations were built in the [[Suez Canal|Suez Canal Zone]], and the Western Desert.\n\nDuring 1938 the REAF received two squadrons (Nos 2 and 5) of [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane fighters<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/acrawford0/Egypt.html</ref> and No. 1 Squadron of then-modern [[Westland Lysander]] reconnaissance aircraft, Egypt was the last state to use the Lysander in action, during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]].\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Egypt during World War II}}\n\nAs the Egyptian border was threatened by an Italian and German invasion during the [[Second World War]], the [[Royal Air Force]] established more airfields in Egypt.  The Royal Egyptian Air Force was sometimes treated as a part of the Royal Air Force, at other times a strict policy of neutrality was followed as Egypt maintained its official neutrality until very late in the war. As a result, few additional aircraft were supplied by Britain, however the arm did receive its first modern fighters, [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and a small number of [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk]]s. In the immediate post-war period, cheap war surplus aircraft, including a large number of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IXs]] were acquired.\n\nA 1946 order of battle for the Air Force can be found in ''Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II.''\n\n===1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War===\n{{Main|1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War}}\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Farouk & Farida Marriage, DHP13655-21-4 01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian airplanes flying over [[Koubbeh Palace]] in celebration of King [[Farouk I]] and Queen Farida's wedding.]]\nFollowing the British withdrawal from the British Protectorate of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948, Egyptian forces crossed into Palestine as part of a wider [[Arab League]] military coalition in support of the Palestinians against the Israelis.  The Egyptian Air Force contribution included the [[Short Stirling]] bomber,<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Alex|title=Stirlings in Egypt|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=204&Itemid=47|publisher=ACIG.org|accessdate=30 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117030021/http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=204&Itemid=47|archivedate=17 January 2014}}</ref> [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]]s performing as light bombers and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]].\n\nTwo Israeli aircraft were shot down and on 22 May 1948, Egyptian Spitfires attacked the [[RAF Ramat David]] airfield, believing that it had already been taken over by Israeli forces. The first raid surprised the British, and resulted in the destruction of several RAF aircraft on the ground, and the deaths of four airmen. The British were uncertain whether the attacking Spitfires had come from Arab or Israeli forces.  When second and third raids followed shortly afterwards, the British were ready and the entire Egyptian force was shot down \u2013 the last aircraft being baited for some time as the RAF pilots attempted to get a close look at its markings.\n\nRelations with Britain were soon restored and the official state of war with Israel ensured that arms purchases continued.  New Spitfire Mk. 22s were purchased to replace the earlier models. In late 1949, Egypt received its first jet fighter, the British [[Gloster Meteor|Gloster Meteor F4]] and shortly after [[de Havilland Vampire|de Havilland Vampire FB5]]s.\n\nIn 1955, Egypt made an agreement to buy heavy arms from [[Czechoslovakia]], culminating four years of attempts.<ref name=\"Laron-p16\">{{cite web|author1=Guy Laron|title=Cutting the Gordian Knot: The Post-WWII Egyptian Quest for Arms and the 1955 Czechoslovak Arms Deal|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/cutting-the-gordian-knot-the-post-wwii-egyptian-quest-for-arms-and-the-1955-czechoslovak|publisher=wilsoncenter.org|pages=16|date=February 2007|quote=\"Egyptian representatives were able to sign a new commercial agreement with Czechoslovakia on 24 October 1951, which included a secret clause stating that \"the government of Czechoslovakia will provide the Egyptian government with arms and ammunition \u2013 to be selected by Egyptian experts \u2013 worth about 600 million Egyptian pounds, to be paid in Egyptian cotton.\" The Egyptian experts requested 200 tanks, 200 armored vehicles, 60 to 100 MIG-15 planes, 2,000 trucks, 1,000 jeeps, and other items...

Heavy losses were sustained by the Egyptian side.  The conflict, though devastating militarily, turned out to be a political victory for Egypt, and resulted in the total withdrawal of the aggressor forces from the country. It also forced the EAF to begin rebuilding with non-British help.\n\nIn 1958, Egypt merged with [[Syria]] to form the [[United Arab Republic]], and the previously separate Egyptian, and Syrian forces were combined as the United Arab Republic Air Force. Though Syria left the union in 1961, Egypt continued to use the union's official name until 1971, including for its air force.\n[[File:A formation of five brand-new EAF Il-28 bombers, seen at low level over Cairo during a parade in September 1956.

The [[Soviet Union]] became the principal supplier of the EAF, and many other Arab states. This allowed the EAF to greatly modernise and boost its combat effectiveness. The [[MiG-21]] Fishbed arrived in the early 1960s, bringing with it a Mach 2 capability. The MiG-21 would remain Egypt's primary fighter for the next two decades. The EAF also began flying the Sukhoi [[Su-7]] fighter/bomber in the mid-1960s. By 1966, Air Group 65, with its primary base at [[Cairo West Air Base]], was operating three squadrons of [[Tupolev Tu-16]] \"Badgers\": No. 34 and 36 Squadrons with bomber variants, and No. 95 Squadron equipped with the Tu-16KS' that could carry [[AS-1 Kennel]] [[air-to-surface missile]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theaviationgeekclub.com/did-you-know-the-former-president-of-egypt-hosni-mubarak-was-a-good-military-pilot-pt-2-nocturnal-il-28-reconnaissance-sorties-over-israel/|title=Did you know the former President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak was a good military pilot?

It never went beyond three prototypes and initial test flights, then was abandoned due to high military cost inflicted upon the Egyptian military involvement in the Yemen War and the defeat in the 1967 war with Israel.\n\n===The Yemen War===\n{{Main|North Yemen Civil War}}\nThe Yemeni Royalist side received support from [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]], while the Yemeni Republicans were supported by Egypt.  The fighting was fierce, featuring heavy urban combat as well as battles in the countryside.  Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved.\n\nStrategically, the Yemen War was an opportunity for Israel. It stagnated Egyptian military plans for the reinforcement of Sinai, by shifting the Egyptian military focus to another theater of operation.  Egyptian historian Mohammed Heikal writes that Israel provided arms shipments and also cultivated relationships with hundreds of European mercenaries fighting for the Royalists in Yemen. Israel established a covert air-supply bridge from [[Djibouti]] to North Yemen. The war also gave the Israelis the opportunity to assess Egyptian combat tactics and adaptability.\n\nEgyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of Jizan, which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased British [[Thunderbird (missile)]] surface-to-air missiles and developed [[King Khalid Air Base|their King Khalid airfield]] near [[Khamis Mushait]]. Riyadh also attempted to convince the United States to respond on its behalf. In Operation Hard Surface, President Kennedy sent jet fighters and bombers to [[King Abdulaziz Air Base|Dhahran Air Base]] from May 1963,<ref>TAC Special Order, 832d Combat Support Group, see [[481st Tactical Fighter Squadron]]</ref> demonstrating to Egypt the seriousness of his commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.\n\n===The Six-Day War===\n{{Main|Six-Day War}}\n[[File:6dayswar1.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Israeli troops examine destroyed Egyptian aircraft.]]\nIn the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] the EAF's combat capacity was severely damaged after the [[Israeli Air Force]] destroyed its air bases in a [[preemptive strike]] codenamed [[Operation Focus]].  During the last four days the EAF conducted only 150 sorties against Israeli units throughout the Sinai.<ref>Kenneth M. Pollack, Mark Grimsley, Peter Maslowski, ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948\u20131991,''University of Nebraska Press, 2004 p.170</ref> After the war, the [[Soviet Union]] replenished EAF stocks, sending large numbers of aircraft and advisors to Egypt to revitalise the EAF.\n\nThe EAF's first air-to-air victory is claimed by Mig-21 pilot Nabil Shoukry against a Mirage IIICJ fighter over Inchas air base two hours following the first Israeli strike.<ref>Nicolle, Cooper, Arab Mig-19 and Mig-21 Units in Combat, 2004, p.16</ref>\n\nOn 8 June of the war, a pair of Egyptian Mig-21's engaged a pair of Mirage III's over the Sinai.  In the ensuing dogfight, EAF's 1st Lt Fakhry El-Ashmawy managed to down one of the Mirage fighters while the second Mirage crashed from fuel exhaustion.<ref>Nicolle, Cooper, ''Arab Migs Volume 4 Units in Combat'', 2013, p.37,</ref><ref>[http://myplace.frontier.com/~anneled/IAFinventory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029041835/http://home.comcast.net/~anneled/IAFinventory.html |date=29 October 2007 }} IAF Inventory</ref>\n\nInitial Egyptian claims were even more inflated, but were later reduced to 72 Israeli aircraft destroyed.  The IDF/AF admitted 45 losses on all fronts, while outside observers put the figure between 55 and 60.  Years later, unofficial Israelis sources admitted ten IDF/AF aircraft downed in air combat on all fronts.  Independent sources put this figure at 11, plus another resulting in fuel exhaustion.  In fact, several Israeli aircraft reportedly downed by ground fire probably fell to Egyptian fighters.<ref>Nicolle, Cooper, Arab Mig-19 and Mig-21 Units in Combat, 2004, p.19</ref>\n\n===The Biafran War===\nDuring the [[Nigerian Civil War]], Nigeria received support from Egypt, as Abdel Nasser sent Egyptian pilots. Pilots were provided to fly the aircraft procured by the Soviet Union, air force [[Mikoyan MiG-17]] fighters and [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombers. The Egyptian conscripts frequently attacked civilian rather than military targets, bombing numerous Red Cross shelters.<ref name=\"Shadows\">''Shadows : Airlift and Airwar in Biafra and Nigeria 1967\u20131970'', by Michael I. Draper ({{ISBN|1-902109-63-5}})</ref>\n\n===The War of Attrition===\n[[File:EAF IL-28 Attrition.jpg|thumb|left|EAF [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombing Israeli targets east of the Suez Canal during the War of Attrition]]\n{{Main|War of Attrition}}\nThe years between 1967 and 1970 involved a prolonged campaign of attrition against Israel. The EAF went through a massive construction program to build new air bases in order to increase its survivability. During this period Egypt also received replacements for losses it suffered during the Six Day War. The EAF was the first branch of the Egyptian armed forces to achieve full combat readiness.\n\nOn 15 July 1967, six Israeli [[Mirage III]] fighters violated Egyptian airspace and orders were given for two formations each consisted of two MiG-21 fighters to intercept, another formation of 2 MiGs piloted by Major Fawzy Salama & Lieutenant Medhat Zaki was ready in West Cairo airbase. Indeed, the formation took off, but for protecting the airbase rather than supporting the interception.\n\n===October War 1973===\nDuring the initial surprise air attack of the [[Yom Kippur War]], over 220 EAF aircraft took part. Unlike their Syrian counterparts, EAF aircraft evaded Israeli radars by flying below detection height. EAF aircraft were held in reserve after that point, mainly concentrating on airfield defence in conjunction with the [[SA-3|SA-3 'Goa']], while the more mobile [[SA-6|SA-6 'Gainful']] protected Egyptian forces at low and medium level, aided by the [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4SP]] and shoulder-held [[SA-7]] SAMs.\n\nDespite these limitations, the EAF conducted offensive sorties from time to time. The Su-7BM was used for quick strafe attacks on Israeli columns and the Mirage IIIE (sometimes confused with the Mirage 5), donated by Libya, carried out long-range attacks deep inside Sinai at [[Bir Gifgafa]].\n\nHowever, when Israeli armoured forces used a gap between the two Egyptian armies to cross the [[Suez Canal]] (Operation Stouthearted Men), they destroyed several Egyptian SAM sites, forcing the EAF into battle against the IAF. The EAF claimed victories and continued to contest IAF operations, while also launching attacks on Israeli ground forces on the East Bank of the Suez Canal. In most of these engagements, Egyptian MiG-21s (of all types) challenged Israeli Mirage IIICJs or Neshers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/dassault-mirage-iiicj-shahak|title=Dassault Mirage IIICJ (Shahak)|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403175004/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/dassault-mirage-iiicj-shahak|archive-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe IAF did not operate freely and did not have complete air supremacy it enjoyed during the previous conflict, the 1967 war. Egyptian MiGs were used with better efficiency than before which included the tactics and lessons learned from the 1967 war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egfighters.freehosting.net/migb.html|title=Mig-21|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021212022942/http://www.egfighters.freehosting.net/migb.html|archive-date=12 December 2002}}</ref>\n\nIt was during this war that the EAF applied the lessons it earlier learnt from the Israelis. A 32-year-old deputy MiG-21 regiment commander who has been flying since he was 15 recalls:\n\"During the war of attrition, the Israeli air force had a favorite ambush tactic\", he told [[Aviation Week and Space Technology]]. \"They would penetrate with two aircraft at medium altitude where they would be quickly picked up by radar, We would scramble four or eight to attack them. But they had another dozen fighters trailing at extremely low altitude below radar coverage. As we climbed to the attack they would zoom up behind and surprise us. My regiment lost MiGs to this ambush tactic three times. But we learned the lesson and practiced the same tactics. In the final fights over Deversoir, we ambushed some Mirages the same way, and my own 'finger four' [[Tactical formation|formation]] shot down four Mirages with the loss of one MiG.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptdailynews.com/egyptian%20airforce.htm|title=Egypt Daily News|accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220060601/http://www.egyptdailynews.com/egyptian%20airforce.htm|archivedate=20 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Egyptian Air Force commander during the war was then-Air Marshal [[Hosni Mubarak]].

All planes are equipped with red, white and black smoke generators. During the shows, the Silver Stars performs eight different formations along with several single aircraft passes. Aircraft #6325 (Star 1) carries the name \"Sharaf\" after the team leader. Another team's planes also carried the pilots names painted at the K-8 nose. All pilots are flying instructors at the [[Egyptian Air force Academy]] based in Belbeis Airport.\n\nThe Egyptian Air Force demonstration team \"The Silver Stars\" was formed in the mid of 1974 to participate at \"[[Yom Kippur War|October War]]\" anniversary. Pilots of the team were flying instructors at the Air force College and flew four [[Aero L-29 Delf\u00edn|L-29]] planes painted in dark green and brown and yellow \u2013 standard color scheme. In 1984, the Sliver Stars aerobatic team switched to six [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]] training airplanes. In the following year, team's planes became nine.\nIn 2003, the team made the switch to the K-8E Karakorum trainer and from 2005 was led by Group Captain Mostafa Fathi.\nSince 2010, the team is now flying ten aircraft \u2013 nine plus one solo.\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{See also|List of aircraft of the Egyptian Air Force}}\n\nThe [[Camp David Accords]] caused a gradual change in the overall composition of the EAF. The EAF began to rely more on US, French and in some cases on Chinese aircraft.\n\nThe addition of these aircraft from multiple sources along with the ones already in the EAF inventory caused increasing serviceability problems. In 1982, the EAF began receiving [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] fighters under the Peace Vector Program. As of 2015, the EAF received a total of 220 F-16s. 18 aircraft were lost in accidents and 7 F-16A/Bs were grounded.\n\nThese grounded F-16A/Bs were later overhauled, upgraded and returned to active service, additional F-16s were acquired to replace those lost. In 1986, the EAF received the French [[Mirage 2000]] fighters, one was lost in a training accident. Egypt also license-built [[Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alphajet]]s, [[Embraer EMB 312 Tucano|Tucano]] airplanes and [[Westland Gazelle]] helicopters.\n\nIn 1987 the [[E-2C Hawkeye]] Airborne Early Warning (AEW) entered service and was upgraded with advanced AN/APS-145 radars. The EAF also upgraded its F-16 fighters to C/D standard that enabled them to fire the [[AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missile.\n\nThe EAF currently operates 46 [[AH-64 Apache]] attack helicopters 36 of which were initially delivered as the AH-64A variant but were later upgraded to AH-64D standard.<ref name=\"boeing.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ah64d/news/2001/q4/nr_011203n.htm |title=Boeing: Boeing, U.S. Army Sign Contract for 35 Egyptian AH-64D Apaches |access-date=3 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111225920/http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ah64d/news/2001/q4/nr_011203n.htm |archive-date=11 November 2007}}</ref> On 22 May 2009, Egypt requested the purchase of 36 [[Apache Arrowhead]] sensor systems as part of an order for 12 Block II AH-64D Apache helicopters.

in support of the [[Egyptian Army]], [[Egyptian Navy]] and the [[Egyptian Air Defense Forces]].  The latter was created as a separate command in the 1970s and it coordinates with the Air Force to integrate air and ground-based air defense operations. The EAF is headed by an [[Air Marshal]] ([[Lieutenant General]] equivalent).  Currently, the commander of the Egyptian Air Force is Air Marshal [[Mohamed Abbas]]. The force's [[motto]] is 'Higher and higher for the sake of glory' ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062f}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|I\u2018la\u2019 al-'ol\u00e0 f\u012b sab\u012bl al-magd}}'').\n\nThe Egyptian Army Air Service was formed in 1932, and became an independent air force in 1937. It had little involvement in the [[Second World War]]. From 1948 to 1973 it took part, with generally mediocre results, in four separate wars with Israel, as well as the quasi-[[War of Attrition]]. It also supported the [[Egyptian Army]] during the [[North Yemen Civil War]] and the [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War]] of 1977.  From 1977 to 2011 it saw virtually no combat, but has participated in numerous exercises, including [[Operation Bright Star]]. Since 1992 the EAF has also provided aviation support for the [[Egyptian National Police|police]] and other national security organizations engaged in the war against terrorism. In recent years the Air Force has acted in the [[Sinai insurgency]], the [[Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)|Second Libyan Civil War]] and the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Intervention in the Yemen]].\n\nThe EAF primary role is the air defence of the nation, with secondary tasks of strike and army support operations. The EAF provides official government transport and carries out international search-and- rescue operations in the desert, the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and the [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn 2014 the IISS estimated the total active manpower of the Egyptian Air Force at approximately 30,000 personnel, including 10,000 conscripts, with reserves of 20,000 personnel.<ref name=IISS2014/> This contrasts with an estimate of some 35,000 personnel, with most aircrew being long-term professionals, in 2010.<ref name=IISS2014/><ref name=\"Ripley\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMq7fhIe-yYC&pg=PA65|title=Middle East Air Power in the 21st Century|last=Ripley|first=Tim|publisher=Casemate Publishers|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84884-099-7|page=65}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment===\nIn late 1928, the [[Parliament of Egypt]] proposed the creation of an Egyptian Air Force. The Egyptian ministry of war announced that it needed volunteers for the new arm to become the first four Egyptian military pilots. Over 200 Egyptian officers volunteered, but in the end only three succeeded in passing strict medical tests and technical examinations.\n\nThese three went to [[No. 4 Flying Training School RAF]] at [[RAF Abu Sueir|RAF Station Abu Sueir]] near the [[Suez Canal]], where they were trained on a variety of aircraft. After graduation, they traveled to the United Kingdom for specialised training.\n[[File:First 3 egyptian pilots.jpg|thumb|upright|First three Egyptian pilots]]\nOn 2 November 1930, the King of Egypt and Sudan, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] announced the creation of the '''Egyptian Army Air Force''' (EAAF). On 27 May 1931 the Egyptian Council of Ministers approved the purchase of five aircraft and the building of an airfield at Almaza (Cairo) with a budget of 50,000 pounds. The aircraft chosen was the British [[de Havilland Gipsy Moth]] trainer, the five modified aircraft were flown from England to Egypt and on arrival in May 1932 the air force was founded and the Almaza airfield was formally opened.\n\nThe first commander of the EAAF was Squadron Leader [[Victor Hubert Tait]] RAF, a [[Canadians|Canadian]], former Senior Air Advisor on the British Military Mission in Egypt. Tait selected staff, weapons and initiated building a number of airfields. In 1934 the British government provided ten [[Avro 626]] aircraft, which were the first real Egyptian military planes. A further 17 626s together with [[Hawker Audax]]es for army cooperation and close support and [[Avro Anson]]s for VIP work followed shortly afterward.\n\nIn 1937 the Egyptian Army Air Force was separated from the Army Command and became an independent branch named the '''Royal Egyptian Air Force''' (REAF). New stations were built in the [[Suez Canal|Suez Canal Zone]], and the Western Desert.\n\nDuring 1938 the REAF received two squadrons (Nos 2 and 5) of [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane fighters<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/acrawford0/Egypt.html</ref> and No. 1 Squadron of then-modern [[Westland Lysander]] reconnaissance aircraft, Egypt was the last state to use the Lysander in action, during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]].\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Egypt during World War II}}\n\nAs the Egyptian border was threatened by an Italian and German invasion during the [[Second World War]], the [[Royal Air Force]] established more airfields in Egypt.  The Royal Egyptian Air Force was sometimes treated as a part of the Royal Air Force, at other times a strict policy of neutrality was followed as Egypt maintained its official neutrality until very late in the war. As a result, few additional aircraft were supplied by Britain, however the arm did receive its first modern fighters, [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and a small number of [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk]]s. In the immediate post-war period, cheap war surplus aircraft, including a large number of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IXs]] were acquired.\n\nA 1946 order of battle for the Air Force can be found in ''Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II.''\n\n===1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War===\n{{Main|1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War}}\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Farouk & Farida Marriage, DHP13655-21-4 01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian airplanes flying over [[Koubbeh Palace]] in celebration of King [[Farouk I]] and Queen Farida's wedding.]]\nFollowing the British withdrawal from the British Protectorate of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948, Egyptian forces crossed into Palestine as part of a wider [[Arab League]] military coalition in support of the Palestinians against the Israelis.  The Egyptian Air Force contribution included the [[Short Stirling]] bomber,<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Alex|title=Stirlings in Egypt|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=204&Itemid=47|publisher=ACIG.org|accessdate=30 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117030021/http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=204&Itemid=47|archivedate=17 January 2014}}</ref> [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]]s performing as light bombers and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]].\n\nTwo Israeli aircraft were shot down and on 22 May 1948, Egyptian Spitfires attacked the [[RAF Ramat David]] airfield, believing that it had already been taken over by Israeli forces. The first raid surprised the British, and resulted in the destruction of several RAF aircraft on the ground, and the deaths of four airmen. The British were uncertain whether the attacking Spitfires had come from Arab or Israeli forces.  When second and third raids followed shortly afterwards, the British were ready and the entire Egyptian force was shot down \u2013 the last aircraft being baited for some time as the RAF pilots attempted to get a close look at its markings.\n\nRelations with Britain were soon restored and the official state of war with Israel ensured that arms purchases continued.  New Spitfire Mk. 22s were purchased to replace the earlier models. In late 1949, Egypt received its first jet fighter, the British [[Gloster Meteor|Gloster Meteor F4]] and shortly after [[de Havilland Vampire|de Havilland Vampire FB5]]s.\n\nIn 1955, Egypt made an agreement to buy heavy arms from [[Czechoslovakia]], culminating four years of attempts.<ref name=\"Laron-p16\">{{cite web|author1=Guy Laron|title=Cutting the Gordian Knot: The Post-WWII Egyptian Quest for Arms and the 1955 Czechoslovak Arms Deal|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/cutting-the-gordian-knot-the-post-wwii-egyptian-quest-for-arms-and-the-1955-czechoslovak|publisher=wilsoncenter.org|pages=16|date=February 2007|quote=\"Egyptian representatives were able to sign a new commercial agreement with Czechoslovakia on 24 October 1951, which included a secret clause stating that \"the government of Czechoslovakia will provide the Egyptian government with arms and ammunition \u2013 to be selected by Egyptian experts \u2013 worth about 600 million Egyptian pounds, to be paid in Egyptian cotton.\" The Egyptian experts requested 200 tanks, 200 armored vehicles, 60 to 100 MIG-15 planes, 2,000 trucks, 1,000 jeeps, and other items...

Initial Soviet bloc deliveries included the [[MiG-15]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombers, [[Ilyushin Il-14]] transports, and [[Yak-11]] trainers. Instructors from [[Czechoslovakia]] accompanied these aircraft.  Egypt also began manufacturing its own Czechoslovak-designed [[B\u00fc 181 Bestmann|Gomhouria B\u00fc 181 Bestmann]] primary trainers at this time\n\n===The Suez Crisis===\n{{Main|Suez Crisis}}\n[[File:Almaza display Sep 1956.jpg|thumb|On display circa 1956, new aircraft purchased from [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[USSR]] clockwise: [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17F]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15bis]], [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]], [[Yakovlev Yak-11|Yak-11]], [[Zl\u00edn Z 26|Zlin 226]], and two [[Mil Mi-1|Mi-1]] helicopters.]]\nAfter the Egyptian Government's nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1956, Egypt was attacked by [[Israel]], France, and the United Kingdom in what came to be known as the [[Suez Crisis]] (\"Tripartite Aggression\" in Egypt). Heavy losses were sustained by the Egyptian side.  The conflict, though devastating militarily, turned out to be a political victory for Egypt, and resulted in the total withdrawal of the aggressor forces from the country. It also forced the EAF to begin rebuilding with non-British help.\n\nIn 1958, Egypt merged with [[Syria]] to form the [[United Arab Republic]], and the previously separate Egyptian, and Syrian forces were combined as the United Arab Republic Air Force. Though Syria left the union in 1961, Egypt continued to use the union's official name until 1971, including for its air force.\n[[File:A formation of five brand-new EAF Il-28 bombers, seen at low level over Cairo during a parade in September 1956.

The [[Soviet Union]] became the principal supplier of the EAF, and many other Arab states. This allowed the EAF to greatly modernise and boost its combat effectiveness. The [[MiG-21]] Fishbed arrived in the early 1960s, bringing with it a Mach 2 capability. The MiG-21 would remain Egypt's primary fighter for the next two decades. The EAF also began flying the Sukhoi [[Su-7]] fighter/bomber in the mid-1960s. By 1966, Air Group 65, with it's primary base at [[Cairo West Air Base]], was operating three squadrons of [[Tupolev Tu-16]] \"Badgers\": No. 34 and 36 Squadrons with bomber variants, and No. 95 Squadron equipped with the Tu-16KS' that could carry [[AS-1 Kennel]] [[air-to-surface missile]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theaviationgeekclub.com/did-you-know-the-former-president-of-egypt-hosni-mubarak-was-a-good-military-pilot-pt-2-nocturnal-il-28-reconnaissance-sorties-over-israel/|title=Did you know the former President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak was a good military pilot?

It never went beyond three prototypes and initial test flights, then was abandoned due to high military cost inflicted upon the Egyptian military involvement in the Yemen War and the defeat in the 1967 war with Israel.\n\n===The Yemen War===\n{{Main|North Yemen Civil War}}\nThe Yemeni Royalist side received support from [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]], while the Yemeni Republicans were supported by Egypt.  The fighting was fierce, featuring heavy urban combat as well as battles in the countryside.  Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved.\n\nStrategically, the Yemen War was an opportunity for Israel. It stagnated Egyptian military plans for the reinforcement of Sinai, by shifting the Egyptian military focus to another theater of operation.  Egyptian historian Mohammed Heikal writes that Israel provided arms shipments and also cultivated relationships with hundreds of European mercenaries fighting for the Royalists in Yemen. Israel established a covert air-supply bridge from [[Djibouti]] to North Yemen. The war also gave the Israelis the opportunity to assess Egyptian combat tactics and adaptability.\n\nEgyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of Jizan, which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased British [[Thunderbird (missile)]] surface-to-air missiles and developed [[King Khalid Air Base|their King Khalid airfield]] near [[Khamis Mushait]]. Riyadh also attempted to convince the United States to respond on its behalf. In Operation Hard Surface, President Kennedy sent jet fighters and bombers to [[King Abdulaziz Air Base|Dhahran Air Base]] from May 1963,<ref>TAC Special Order, 832d Combat Support Group, see [[481st Tactical Fighter Squadron]]</ref> demonstrating to Egypt the seriousness of his commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.\n\n===The Six-Day War===\n{{Main|Six-Day War}}\n[[File:6dayswar1.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Israeli troops examine destroyed Egyptian aircraft.]]\nIn the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] the EAF's combat capacity was severely damaged after the [[Israeli Air Force]] destroyed its air bases in a [[preemptive strike]] codenamed [[Operation Focus]].  During the last four days the EAF conducted only 150 sorties against Israeli units throughout the Sinai.<ref>Kenneth M. Pollack, Mark Grimsley, Peter Maslowski, ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948\u20131991,''University of Nebraska Press, 2004 p.170</ref> After the war, the [[Soviet Union]] replenished EAF stocks, sending large numbers of aircraft and advisors to Egypt to revitalise the EAF.\n\nThe EAF's first air-to-air victory is claimed by Mig-21 pilot Nabil Shoukry against a Mirage IIICJ fighter over Inchas air base two hours following the first Israeli strike.<ref>Nicolle, Cooper, Arab Mig-19 and Mig-21 Units in Combat, 2004, p.16</ref>\n\nOn 8 June of the war, a pair of Egyptian Mig-21's engaged a pair of Mirage III's over the Sinai.  In the ensuing dogfight, EAF's 1st Lt Fakhry El-Ashmawy managed to down one of the Mirage fighters while the second Mirage crashed from fuel exhaustion.<ref>Nicolle, Cooper, ''Arab Migs Volume 4 Units in Combat'', 2013, p.37,</ref><ref>[http://myplace.frontier.com/~anneled/IAFinventory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029041835/http://home.comcast.net/~anneled/IAFinventory.html |date=29 October 2007 }} IAF Inventory</ref>\n\nInitial Egyptian claims were even more inflated, but were later reduced to 72 Israeli aircraft destroyed.  The IDF/AF admitted 45 losses on all fronts, while outside observers put the figure between 55 and 60.  Years later, unofficial Israelis sources admitted ten IDF/AF aircraft downed in air combat on all fronts.  Independent sources put this figure at 11, plus another resulting in fuel exhaustion.  In fact several Israeli aircraft reportedly downed by ground fire probably fell to Egyptian fighters.<ref>Nicolle, Cooper, Arab Mig-19 and Mig-21 Units in Combat, 2004, p.19</ref>\n\n===The Biafran War===\nDuring the [[Nigerian Civil War]], Nigeria received support from Egypt, as Abdel Nasser sent Egyptian pilots. Pilots were provided to fly the aircraft procured by the Soviet Union, air force [[Mikoyan MiG-17]] fighters and [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombers. The Egyptian conscripts frequently attacked civilian rather than military targets, bombing numerous Red Cross shelters.<ref name=\"Shadows\">''Shadows : Airlift and Airwar in Biafra and Nigeria 1967\u20131970'', by Michael I. Draper ({{ISBN|1-902109-63-5}})</ref>\n\n===The War of Attrition===\n[[File:EAF IL-28 Attrition.jpg|thumb|left|EAF [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombing Israeli targets east of the Suez Canal during the War of Attrition]]\n{{Main|War of Attrition}}\nThe years between 1967 and 1970 involved a prolonged campaign of attrition against Israel. The EAF went through a massive construction program to build new air bases in order to increase its survivability. During this period Egypt also received replacements for losses it suffered during the Six Day War. The EAF was the first branch of the Egyptian armed forces to achieve full combat readiness.\n\nOn 15 July 1967, six Israeli [[Mirage III]] fighters violated Egyptian airspace and orders were given for two formations each consisted of two MiG-21 fighters to intercept, another formation of 2 MiGs piloted by Major Fawzy Salama & Lieutenant Medhat Zaki was ready in West Cairo airbase. Indeed, the formation took off, but for protecting the airbase rather than supporting the interception.\n\n===October War 1973===\nDuring the initial surprise air attack of the [[Yom Kippur War]], over 220 EAF aircraft took part. Unlike their Syrian counterparts, EAF aircraft evaded Israeli radars by flying below detection height. EAF aircraft were held in reserve after that point, mainly concentrating on airfield defence in conjunction with the [[SA-3|SA-3 'Goa']], while the more mobile [[SA-6|SA-6 'Gainful']] protected Egyptian forces at low and medium level, aided by the [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4SP]] and shoulder-held [[SA-7]] SAMs.\n\nDespite these limitations, the EAF conducted offensive sorties from time to time. The Su-7BM was used for quick strafe attacks on Israeli columns and the Mirage IIIE (sometimes confused with the Mirage 5), donated by Libya, carried out long-range attacks deep inside Sinai at [[Bir Gifgafa]].\n\nHowever, when Israeli armoured forces used a gap between the two Egyptian armies to cross the [[Suez Canal]] (Operation Stouthearted Men), they destroyed several Egyptian SAM sites, forcing the EAF into battle against the IAF. The EAF claimed victories and continued to contest IAF operations, while also launching attacks on Israeli ground forces on the East Bank of the Suez Canal. In most of these engagements, Egyptian MiG-21s (of all types) challenged Israeli Mirage IIICJs or Neshers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/dassault-mirage-iiicj-shahak|title=Dassault Mirage IIICJ (Shahak)|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403175004/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/dassault-mirage-iiicj-shahak|archive-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe IAF did not operate freely and did not have complete air supremacy it enjoyed during the previous conflict, the 1967 war.

A 32-year-old deputy MiG-21 regiment commander who has been flying since he was 15 recalls:\n\"During the war of attrition, the Israeli air force had a favorite ambush tactic\", he told [[Aviation Week and Space Technology]]. \"They would penetrate with two aircraft at medium altitude where they would be quickly picked up by radar, We would scramble four or eight to attack them. But they had another dozen fighters trailing at extremely low altitude below radar coverage. As we climbed to the attack they would zoom up behind and surprise us. My regiment lost MiGs to this ambush tactic three times. But we learned the lesson and practiced the same tactics. In the final fights over Deversoir, we ambushed some Mirages the same way, and my own 'finger four' [[Tactical formation|formation]] shot down four Mirages with the loss of one MiG.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptdailynews.com/egyptian%20airforce.htm|title=Egypt Daily News|accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220060601/http://www.egyptdailynews.com/egyptian%20airforce.htm|archivedate=20 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Egyptian Air Force commander during the war was then-Air Marshal [[Hosni Mubarak]].

All planes are equipped with red, white and black smoke generators. During the shows, the Silver Stars performs eight different formations along with several single aircraft passes. Aircraft #6325 (Star 1) carries the name \"Sharaf\" after the team leader. Another team's planes also carried the pilots names painted at the K-8 nose. All pilots are flying instructors at the [[Egyptian Air force Academy]] based in Belbeis Airport.\n\nThe Egyptian Air Force demonstration team \"The Silver Stars\" was formed in the mid of 1974 to participate at \"[[Yom Kippur War|October War]]\" anniversary. Pilots of the team were flying instructors at the Air force College and flew four [[Aero L-29 Delf\u00edn|L-29]] planes painted in dark green and brown and yellow \u2013 standard color scheme. In 1984, the Sliver Stars aerobatic team switched to six [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]] training airplanes. In the following year, team's planes became nine.\nIn 2003, the team made the switch to the K-8E Karakorum trainer and from 2005 was led by Group Captain Mostafa Fathi.\nSince 2010, the team is now flying ten aircraft \u2013 nine plus one solo.\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{See also|List of aircraft of the Egyptian Air Force}}\n\nThe [[Camp David Accords]] caused a gradual change in the overall composition of the EAF. The EAF began to rely more on US, French and in some cases on Chinese aircraft.\n\nThe addition of these aircraft from multiple sources along with the ones already in the EAF inventory caused increasing serviceability problems. In 1982, the EAF began receiving [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] fighters under the Peace Vector Program. As of 2015, the EAF received a total of 220 F-16s. 18 aircraft were lost in accidents and 7 F-16A/Bs were grounded.\n\nThese grounded F-16A/Bs were later overhauled, upgraded and returned to active service, additional F-16s were acquired to replace those lost. In 1986, the EAF received the French [[Mirage 2000]] fighters, one was lost in a training accident. Egypt also license-built [[Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alphajet]]s, [[Embraer EMB 312 Tucano|Tucano]] airplanes and [[Westland Gazelle]] helicopters.\n\nIn 1987 the [[E-2C Hawkeye]] Airborne Early Warning (AEW) entered service and was upgraded with advanced AN/APS-145 radars. The EAF also upgraded its F-16 fighters to C/D standard that enabled them to fire the [[AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missile.\n\nThe EAF currently operates 46 [[AH-64 Apache]] attack helicopters 36 of which were initially delivered as the AH-64A variant but were later upgraded to AH-64D standard.<ref name=\"boeing.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ah64d/news/2001/q4/nr_011203n.htm |title=Boeing: Boeing, U.S. Army Sign Contract for 35 Egyptian AH-64D Apaches |access-date=3 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111225920/http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ah64d/news/2001/q4/nr_011203n.htm |archive-date=11 November 2007}}</ref> On 22 May 2009, Egypt requested the purchase of 36 [[Apache Arrowhead]] sensor systems as part of an order for 12 Block II AH-64D Apache helicopters.

It is a [[Cover version|covers album]], featuring covers of songs by bands such as the [[Pretty Things]], [[the Who]], [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Pink Floyd]]. Like his two previous albums, it was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from two members of Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Trevor Bolder]]; [[Mick Woodmansey]] was replaced by [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums. It was recorded in July and August 1973 at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] in [[H\u00e9rouville]], France.\n\nPreceded by [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)#David Bowie version|his cover]] of [[the McCoys]]' song \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", ''Pinups'' peaked at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], bringing the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.

''Pinups'' entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 (coincidentally the same day as [[Bryan Ferry]]'s covers album ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'') and stayed there for 21 weeks, eventually peaking at No. 1. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=115}} It re-entered the chart on 30 April 1983, this time for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 57. In July 1990, it again entered the chart, for one week, at No. 52. The lead single, a cover of [[the McCoys]]' \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nSince release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. In a review for ''Pinups'' on release, Greg Shaw of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, writing, \"Although many of the tracks are excellent, none stands up to the originals.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He further believed that all the tracks were underproduced and believed Bowie's vocal performance to be the album's \"true failure\", believing his \"excessively mannered voice\" was \"a ridiculously weak mismatch for the material\" and that they were mixed too high to give the tracks the \"edge\" or \"punch\" they need to be effective.<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He concludes his review saying, \"while ''Pinups'' may be a failure, it is also a collection of great songs, most of which are given a more than adequate, and always loving, treatment. Maybe the fairest conclusion to draw is that Bowie can\u2019t sing any other way, did the best he could, and the result isn\u2019t all that bad.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> When reviewing the album as part of the 2015 box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'', Douglas Wolk of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, calling it a \"quick-and-sloppy covers album\".<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Although he believed the album was \"more interesting in theory\", he found that the execution was sloppy, believing that all the original versions were \"vastly\" superior and Bowie added nothing interesting to any of them. He further believed that it didn't help that [[the Spiders from Mars]] were falling apart when recording it.<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]] similarly found the album to be out of place with Bowie's output up to that point.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> He continued, \"''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'' had established Bowie as perhaps the most fiercely original of all England's glam rockers, so an album of covers didn't make any sense and was especially confusing for American fans,\" further criticising the song choices as unknown.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> However, Eder went on to praise Bowie's cover of \"Sorrow\", arguing that it's a \"distinct improvement\" over the original. He states that although the album is dismissed by many as just another covers album, Eder views it as an artistic statement and in the context of Bowie's entire career, it represented a \"swan song\" for the Spiders from Mars and an \"interlude\" between the first and second phases of his international career, with his next album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' being the end of his glam rock era. He concludes his review writing, \"It's not a bad bridge between the two, and it has endured across the decades.\"<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" />\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side one\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Rosalyn (song)|Rosalyn]]\n| writer1      = [[Jimmy Duncan (songwriter)|Jimmy Duncan]], Bill Farley\n| extra1       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length1      = 2:27\n| title2       = [[Here Comes the Night]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = [[Bert Berns]]\n| extra2       = [[Them (band)|Them]]\n| length2      = 3:09\n| title3       = [[I Wish You Would (Billy Boy Arnold song)|I Wish You Would]]\n| note3        = *\n| writer3      = [[Billy Boy Arnold]]\n| extra3       = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length3      = 2:40\n| title4       = [[See Emily Play]]\n| writer4      = [[Syd Barrett]]\n| extra4       = [[Pink Floyd]]\n| length4      = 4:03\n| title5       = [[Everything's Alright (The Mojos song)|Everything's Alright]]\n| writer5      = Nicky Crouch, John Konrad, Simon Stavely, Stuart James, Keith Karlson\n| extra5       = [[The Mojos]]\n| length5      = 2:26\n| title6       = [[I Can't Explain]]\n| writer6      = [[Pete Townshend]]\n| extra6       = [[The Who]]\n| length6      = 2:07\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side two\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Friday on My Mind]]\n| writer1      = [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]], [[Harry Vanda]]\n| extra1       = [[The Easybeats]]\n| length1      = 3:18\n| title2       = [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = Bob Feldman, [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], [[Richard Gottehrer]]\n| extra2       = [[The McCoys]]\n| length2      = 2:48\n| title3       = [[Don't Bring Me Down (Pretty Things song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\n| writer3      = [[Fairies (British band)|Johnnie Dee]]\n| extra3       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length3      = 2:01\n| title4      = [[Shapes of Things]]\n| writer4     = [[Paul Samwell-Smith]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| extra4      = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length4     = 2:47\n| title5      = [[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\n| writer5     = [[Roger Daltrey]], Townshend\n| extra5      = The Who\n| length5     = 3:04\n| title6      = [[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]\n| writer6     = [[Ray Davies]]\n| extra6      = [[The Kinks]]\n| length6     = 2:35\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u201312 on CD reissues.\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Bonus Tracks (1990 Rykodisc/EMI)\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title13      = [[Growin' Up]]\n| note13       = Previously unreleased; from the early ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' sessions\n| writer13     = [[Bruce Springsteen]]\n| extra13      = Bruce Springsteen\n| length13     = 3:26\n| title14      = [[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Port of Amsterdam]]\n| note14       = [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Sorrow\" single\n| writer14     = [[Jacques Brel]], <abbr title=\"translated by\">trans.</abbr> [[Mort Shuman]]\n| extra14      = Jacques Brel\n| length14     = 3:19\n}}\n\nSongs marked with a <nowiki>*</nowiki> were not recorded for the first time by the acts listed, but were popularized by them.\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[alto saxophone]], [[harmonica]], [[arrangement]]s, backing vocals, [[Moog synthesiser]]<ref name=allmusiccredits>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2484|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Pin Ups > Credits ))) |accessdate=15 July 2008 |publisher=allmusic}}</ref>\n*[[Mick Ronson]] \u2013 guitar, piano, vocals, arrangements<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*[[Trevor Bolder]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Aynsley Dunbar]] \u2013 drums\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\n*[[Mike Garson]] \u2013 piano, [[organ (music)|organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[electric piano]]<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*Ken Fordham \u2013 [[baritone saxophone]]\n*[[Warren Peace|G.A.

Bowie]], released in October 1973 on [[RCA Records]]. Like his two previous albums, it was produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] and features contributions from two members of Bowie's backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Trevor Bolder]]; [[Mick Woodmansey]] was replaced by [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums. It is a [[Cover version|covers album]], featuring covers of songs by bands such as the [[Pretty Things]], [[the Who]], [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Pink Floyd]].\n\nPreceded by [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)#David Bowie version|his cover]] of [[the McCoys]]' song \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", ''Pinups'' peaked at No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], bringing the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six. However, since release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. It was remastered in 2015 as part of the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]''.<ref name=\"five years box set\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Five Years (1969\u20131973)|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=2015|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|location=UK, Europe & US|type=Box set liner notes|id=DBXL 1}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nAccording to co-producer [[Ken Scott]], the LP was originally conceived as \"a complete opposite of [Bowie's] other albums\", consisting of all cover songs except one original composition, and mainly turned towards the US market since \"he wanted to do songs that weren't known as well in the States as they were in England\", yet eventually the plan was dropped.<ref>{{citation |last1=Scott |first1=Ken |title=Abbey Road to Ziggy Stardust: Off-the-record with The Beatles, Bowie, Elton, and so much more. |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing Co. |edition=1st |year=2012}}</ref> ''Pinups'' was the first of two \"1960s nostalgia\" albums that Bowie had planned to release.

''Pinups'' entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 (coincidentally the same day as [[Bryan Ferry]]'s covers album ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'') and stayed there for 21 weeks, eventually peaking at No. 1. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=115}} It re-entered the chart on 30 April 1983, this time for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 57. In July 1990, it again entered the chart, for one week, at No. 52. The lead single, a cover of [[the McCoys]]' \"[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\", peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nSince release, the album has received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics, many of whom criticised the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. In a review for ''Pinups'' on release, Greg Shaw of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, writing, \"Although many of the tracks are excellent, none stands up to the originals.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He further believed that all the tracks were underproduced and believed Bowie's vocal performance to be the album's \"true failure\", believing his \"excessively mannered voice\" was \"a ridiculously weak mismatch for the material\" and that they were mixed too high to give the tracks the \"edge\" or \"punch\" they need to be effective.<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> He concludes his review saying, \"while ''Pinups'' may be a failure, it is also a collection of great songs, most of which are given a more than adequate, and always loving, treatment. Maybe the fairest conclusion to draw is that Bowie can\u2019t sing any other way, did the best he could, and the result isn\u2019t all that bad.\"<ref name=\"RS Shaw\" /> When reviewing the album as part of the 2015 box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'', Douglas Wolk of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album an unfavorable review, calling it a \"quick-and-sloppy covers album\".<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Although he believed the album was \"more interesting in theory\", he found that the execution was sloppy, believing that all the original versions were \"vastly\" superior and Bowie added nothing interesting to any of them. He further believed that it didn't help that [[the Spiders from Mars]] were falling apart when recording it.<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" /> Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]] similarly found the album to be out of place with Bowie's output up to that point.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> He continued, \"''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'' had established Bowie as perhaps the most fiercely original of all England's glam rockers, so an album of covers didn't make any sense and was especially confusing for American fans,\" further criticising the song choices as unknown.<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" /> However, Eder went on to praise Bowie's cover of \"Sorrow\", arguing that it's a \"distinct improvement\" over the original. He states that although the album is dismissed by many as just another covers album, Eder views it as an artistic statement and in the context of Bowie's entire career, it represented a \"swan song\" for the Spiders from Mars and an \"interlude\" between the first and second phases of his international career, with his next album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' being the end of his glam rock era. He concludes his review writing, \"It's not a bad bridge between the two, and it has endured across the decades.\"<ref name=\"Eder AllMusic\" />\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side one\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Rosalyn (song)|Rosalyn]]\n| writer1      = [[Jimmy Duncan (songwriter)|Jimmy Duncan]], Bill Farley\n| extra1       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length1      = 2:27\n| title2       = [[Here Comes the Night]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = [[Bert Berns]]\n| extra2       = [[Them (band)|Them]]\n| length2      = 3:09\n| title3       = [[I Wish You Would (Billy Boy Arnold song)|I Wish You Would]]\n| note3        = *\n| writer3      = [[Billy Boy Arnold]]\n| extra3       = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length3      = 2:40\n| title4       = [[See Emily Play]]\n| writer4      = [[Syd Barrett]]\n| extra4       = [[Pink Floyd]]\n| length4      = 4:03\n| title5       = [[Everything's Alright (The Mojos song)|Everything's Alright]]\n| writer5      = Nicky Crouch, John Konrad, Simon Stavely, Stuart James, Keith Karlson\n| extra5       = [[The Mojos]]\n| length5      = 2:26\n| title6       = [[I Can't Explain]]\n| writer6      = [[Pete Townshend]]\n| extra6       = [[The Who]]\n| length6      = 2:07\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Side two\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title1       = [[Friday on My Mind]]\n| writer1      = [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]], [[Harry Vanda]]\n| extra1       = [[The Easybeats]]\n| length1      = 3:18\n| title2       = [[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]\n| note2        = *\n| writer2      = Bob Feldman, [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], [[Richard Gottehrer]]\n| extra2       = [[The McCoys]]\n| length2      = 2:48\n| title3       = [[Don't Bring Me Down (Pretty Things song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\n| writer3      = [[Fairies (British band)|Johnnie Dee]]\n| extra3       = [[Pretty Things]]\n| length3      = 2:01\n| title4      = [[Shapes of Things]]\n| writer4     = [[Paul Samwell-Smith]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| extra4      = [[The Yardbirds]]\n| length4     = 2:47\n| title5      = [[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\n| writer5     = [[Roger Daltrey]], Townshend\n| extra5      = The Who\n| length5     = 3:04\n| title6      = [[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]\n| writer6     = [[Ray Davies]]\n| extra6      = [[The Kinks]]\n| length6     = 2:35\n}}\n\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u201312 on CD reissues.\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Bonus Tracks (1990 Rykodisc/EMI)\n| extra_column = Originally by\n| title13      = [[Growin' Up]]\n| note13       = Previously unreleased; from the early ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' sessions\n| writer13     = [[Bruce Springsteen]]\n| extra13      = Bruce Springsteen\n| length13     = 3:26\n| title14      = [[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Port of Amsterdam]]\n| note14       = [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Sorrow\" single\n| writer14     = [[Jacques Brel]], <abbr title=\"translated by\">trans.</abbr> [[Mort Shuman]]\n| extra14      = Jacques Brel\n| length14     = 3:19\n}}\n\nSongs marked with a <nowiki>*</nowiki> were not recorded for the first time by the acts listed, but were popularized by them.\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 vocals, guitar, [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[alto saxophone]], [[harmonica]], [[arrangement]]s, backing vocals, [[Moog synthesiser]]<ref name=allmusiccredits>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2484|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Pin Ups > Credits ))) |accessdate=15 July 2008 |publisher=allmusic}}</ref>\n*[[Mick Ronson]] \u2013 guitar, piano, vocals, arrangements<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*[[Trevor Bolder]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Aynsley Dunbar]] \u2013 drums\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\n*[[Mike Garson]] \u2013 piano, [[organ (music)|organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[electric piano]]<ref name=allmusiccredits />\n*Ken Fordham \u2013 [[baritone saxophone]]\n*[[Warren Peace|G.A.
