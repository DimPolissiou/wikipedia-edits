She is currently the lead vocalist of Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]].\n\nJansen first became known as a member of symphonic metal band [[After Forever]], standing as their lead vocalist from 1997, when she joined at age 16, to their disbanding in 2009. When After Forever disbanded, she formed [[ReVamp]] and has released two albums with them. In 2012 following the departure of their lead vocalist [[Anette Olzon]], Nightwish brought in Jansen as a touring member until the end of their [[Imaginaerum World Tour]]. In 2013, they announced Jansen was now their full-time lead vocalist; she subsequently disbanded ReVamp to focus on Nightwish. In 2018, she and [[Pagan's Mind]] guitarist J\u00f8rn Viggo Lofstad premiered their [[hard rock]] duo [[Northward (band)|Northward]].\n\nA frequent collaborator of [[Arjen Anthony Lucassen]], she is a member of his [[progressive metal]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Star One (band)|Star One]], and sang in the [[Ayreon]] albums ''[[Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer]]'', ''[[01011001]]'', and ''[[The Source (Ayreon album)|The Source]]'', as well as the live album ''[[Ayreon Universe \u2013 The Best of Ayreon Live]]''. She also sang lead vocals in several songs of the [[Mayan (band)|MaYan]] album ''[[Quarterpast]]'' and in [[Avalon (Finnish band)|Avalon]]'s ''[[Angels of the Apocalypse]]''. She is the older sister of fellow singer [[Irene Jansen]], who also worked with Ayreon.\n{{Toc limit}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===After Forever (1997\u20132009)===\nJansen was sixteen when she joined Apocalypse (later known as After Forever) in 1997. Three years later the band released its first album, ''[[Prison of Desire]]''. Her ability to sing both classical and rock music has made her reasonably popular in the metal scene. She took sole charge of After Forever's lyrics and vocal melodies since the departure of [[Mark Jansen]] (no relation) in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp9jzwzIvJA |title=After Forever \u2013 Interview w/ Floor Jansen + Joost van den Broek (Part 1) |author=Nuclear Blast Records |via=YouTube |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> Prior to this, up until the ''[[Decipher (After Forever album)|Decipher]]'' (2001) album, the two would write together.

She is currently the lead vocalist of Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]].\n\nJansen first became known as a member of symphonic metal band [[After Forever]], standing as their lead vocalist from 1997, when she joined at age 16, to their disbanding in 2009. When After Forever disbanded, she formed [[ReVamp]] and has released two albums with them. In 2012 following the departure of their lead vocalist [[Anette Olzon]], Nightwish brought in Jansen as a touring member until the end of their [[Imaginaerum World Tour]]. In 2013, they announced Jansen was now their full-time lead vocalist; she subsequently disbanded ReVamp to focus on Nightwish. In 2018, she and [[Pagan's Mind]] guitarist J\u00f8rn Viggo Lofstad premiered their [[hard rock]] duo [[Northward (band)|Northward]].\n\nA frequent collaborator of [[Arjen Anthony Lucassen]], she is a member of his [[progressive metal]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Star One (band)|Star One]], and sang in the [[Ayreon]] albums ''[[Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer]]'', ''[[01011001]]'', and ''[[The Source (Ayreon album)|The Source]]'', as well as the live album ''[[Ayreon Universe \u2013 The Best of Ayreon Live]]''. She also sang lead vocals in several songs of the [[Mayan (band)|MaYan]] album ''[[Quarterpast]]'' and in [[Avalon (Finnish band)|Avalon]]'s ''[[Angels of the Apocalypse]]''. She is the older sister of fellow singer [[Irene Jansen]], who also worked with Ayreon.\n{{Toc limit}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===After Forever (1997\u20132009)===\nJansen was sixteen when she joined Apocalypse (later known as After Forever) in 1997. Three years later the band released its first album, ''[[Prison of Desire]]''. Her ability to sing both classical and rock music has made her reasonably popular in the metal scene. She took sole charge of After Forever's lyrics and vocal melodies since the departure of [[Mark Jansen]] (no relation) in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp9jzwzIvJA |title=After Forever \u2013 Interview w/ Floor Jansen + Joost van den Broek (Part 1) |author=Nuclear Blast Records |via=YouTube |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> Prior to this, up until the ''[[Decipher (After Forever album)|Decipher]]'' (2001) album, the two would write together.

It involved not just a controversial book, but a publisher that was working with individuals on both sides of a longstanding and traumatic familial rupture. This presented unique circumstances that clearly coloured the positions staked out and decisions taken. If the end result here is that this book, regardless of its merits, disappears without a trace, readers will be denied the opportunity to read it and render their own judgments.\"<ref name=\"jw\" /> She also said that she hoped the controversy would not mean that publishers would reject \"manuscripts that editors think are worthwhile but that are about, or even by, people who may be considered contemptible\".<ref name=\"jw\" /> Jo Glanville, the former director of writers' group [[English PEN]] and an editor on ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', also objected to Hachette's decision. In an article in ''[[The Observer]]'', Glanville stated \"I am always afraid when a mob, however small and well-read, exercises power without any accountability, process or redress. That frightens me much more than the prospect of Woody Allen's autobiography hitting the bookstores.\"<ref name=\"observer\" /> Noting that Allen had been investigated twice after the accusation of alleged abuse and never charged, Glanville argued that \"The staff at Hachette who walked out were not behaving like publishers; they were acting as censors\".<ref name=\"observer\" /> In an editorial, the ''[[New York Post]]'' condemned Ronan Farrow's actions. ''The Post'' wrote \" No matter how deep his anger, it's obscene for a journalist to be silencing anyone.
