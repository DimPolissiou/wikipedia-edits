It follows on from the [[Mail Abuse Prevention System]] project which introduced reputation data as a mechanism for protecting against email [[Spam (electronic)|spam]]. RPZ extends the use of reputation data into the Domain Name System.\n\n==Function==\nRPZ allows a DNS recursive resolver to choose specific actions to be performed for a number of collections of domain name data (zones).  \n\nFor each zone, the DNS service may choose to perform full resolution (normal behaviour), or other actions, including declaring that the requested domain does not exist (technically, NXDOMAIN), or that the user should visit a different domain (technically, CNAME), amongst other potential actions.\n\nAs zone information can be obtained from external sources (via a zone transfer) this allows a DNS service to obtain information from an external organisation about domain information and then choose to handle that information in a non-standard manner.\n\n==Purpose==\nRPZ is essentially a filtering mechanism, either preventing people from visiting internet domains, or pointing them to other locations by manipulating the DNS answers in different ways.  \n\nRPZ provides the opportunity for DNS recursive resolver operators to be able to obtain reputational data from external organisations about domains that may be harmful, and then use that information to avoid harm coming to the computers that use the recursive resolver by preventing those computers from visiting the potentially harmful domains.\n\n==Mechanism and data==\nRPZ is a mechanism that needs data on which it is to respond.  \n\nSome Internet security organisations have offered data describing potentially dangerous domains early in the development of the RPZ mechanism. Others services also offer RPZ for specific domain categories (for example for adult content domains). A recursive resolver operator is also easily capable of defining their own domain name data (zones) to be used by RPZ.\n\n==Example of use==\nConsider that Alice uses a computer which uses a DNS service (recursive resolver) which is configured to use RPZ and has access to some source of zone data which lists domains that are believed to be dangerous.\n\nAlice receives an email with a link that appears to resolve to some place that she trusts, and she wishes to click on the link.  She does so, but the actual location is not the trusted source that she read but a dangerous location which is known to the DNS service.  \n\nAs the DNS service realizes that the resulting web location is dangerous, instead of informing her computer how to get to it (unmodified response), it sends information which leads to a safe location.  Depending on how the DNS service configures its policy actions, the modified response can be a fixed page on a web site which informs her of what has happened, or a DNS error code such as NXDOMAIN or NODATA, or send no response at all.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Google Safe Browsing]]\n* [[BIND]]\n* [[DNS management software]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.circleid.com/posts/20100728_taking_back_the_dns/ The original blog post (Paul Vixie)]\n* [http://www.isc.org/files/imce/DNSRPZ-2011-03-01-Webinar.pdf Slides with more detail (Paul Vixie)]\n* [http://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/669/spamhaus-dbl-as-a-response-policy-zone Spamhaus' RPZ data feed information]\n* [https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00525 Building DNS Firewalls with Response Policy Zones]\n\n\n\n[[Category:DNS software]]\n[[Category:Free network-related software]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=January 2018}}\n<!-- The svg version misses some text -->[[File:Response policy zone (raster).png|thumb|alt=DNS flow diagram|upright=1.35|DNS response modification under policy restrictions]]\n\nA '''response policy zone''' ('''RPZ''') is a mechanism to introduce a customized policy in [[Domain Name System]] servers, so that recursive resolvers return possibly modified results.

The monophyly of this family has not been supported. The streblid subfamily [[Trichobiinae]] may be more closely related to the [[Nycteriboscinae]] and other lineages in the [[Nycteribiidae]]. Several authors favor splitting the family into an [[Old World]] lineage consisting of the [[Ascodipterinae]] and [[Nycteriboscinae]] and a [[New World]] lineage containing all other subfamilies.

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] opened its new railway station in 2003, on the [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] that had closed to passengers in 1969.\n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.

The structure of their [[zoospores]] and genetic studies show them to be a primitive group of [[heterokont]]s, but their classification and treatment remains somewhat unsettled.\n\nThis class has usually two orders, Labyrinthulales and Thraustochytriales (ICBN), or Labyrinthulida and '''Thraustochytrida''' (ICZN),<ref name=\"urlwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=35131 |title=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |format= |website= |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> but a third has recently been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= | author1= Gomaa | author2= Mitchell | author3=Lara | year=2013 |title=Amphitremida (Poche, 1913) Is a New Major, Ubiquitous Labyrinthulomycete Clade | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 |issue=1 | pages= e53046 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053046| pmid= 23341921 | pmc= 3544814 | bibcode= 2013PLoSO...853046G }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| author1= ANDERSON| author2= CAVALIER-SMITH | year=2012 |title=Ultrastructure of Diplophrys parva, a New Small Freshwater Species, and a Revised Analysis of Labyrinthulea (Heterokonta) | url=http://www.eko.uj.edu.pl/ap | journal=Acta Protozoologica | volume=8 |issue=1 | pages= 291\u2013304| doi=10.4467/16890027AP.12.023.0783 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last1=FioRito | first=Rebecca | last2=Leander | first2=Celeste | last3=Leander | first3=Brian | year=2016 |title=Characterization of three novel species of Labyrinthulomycota isolated from ochre sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus) | journal=Marine Biology | volume=163 |issue=8 | pages=170 | doi=10.1007/s00227-016-2944-5 }}</ref>\n\n* Genus ''[[Stellarchytrium]]'' <small>FioRito & Leander 2016</small>\n* Family [[Oblongichytriidae]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n** Genus ''[[Oblongichytrium]]'' <small>Yokoyama & Honda 2007</small>\n* Order [[Labyrinthulida]] <small>Doflein 1901</small>\n** Family [[Aplanochytriidae]] <small>Leander ex Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Aplanochytrium]]'' <small>Bahnweg & Sparrow 1972</small> [''[[Labyrinthuloides]]'' Perkins 1973</small>] \n** Family [[Labyrinthulidae]] <small>Cienkowski 1867</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Labyrinthomyxa]]'' <small>Duboscq 1921</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Pseudoplasmodium]]'' <small>Molisch 1925</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Labyrinthula]]'' <small>Cienkowski 1864</small> [''[[Labyrinthodictyon]]'' <small>Valkanov 1969</small>; ''[[Labyrinthorhiza]]'' <small>Chadefaud 1956</small>]\n* Order [[Amphitremida]] <small>Gomaa et al. 2013</small>\n** Family [[Diplophryidae]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Diplophrys]]'' <small>Barker 1868</small>\n** Family [[Amphitrematidae]] <small>Poche 1913</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Paramphitrema]]'' <small>Valkanov 1970</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Archerella]]'' <small>Loeblich & Tappan 1961</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Amphitrema]]'' <small>Archer 1867</small>\n* Order [[Thraustochytriida]] <small>Alderman & 1974</small>\n** Genus ''[[Pyrrhosorus]]'' <small>Juel 1901</small>\n** Genus ''[[Thanatostrea]]'' <small>Franc & Arvy 1969</small>\n** Family [[Althorniidae]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Althornia]]'' <small>Jones & Alderman 1972</small>\n** Family [[Sorodiplophryidae]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Sorodiplophrys]]'' <small>Olive & Dykstra 1975</small>\n** Family [[Amphifilidae]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Amphifila]]'' <small>Cavalier-Smith 2012</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Fibrophrys columna]]'' <small>Takahashi et al. 2016</small>\n** Family [[Thraustochytriidae]] <small>Sparrow ex Cejp 1959</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Japonochytrium]]'' <small>Kobayasi & \u00d4kubo 1953</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Monorhizochytrium]]'' <small>Doi & Honda 2017</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Sicyoidochytrium]]'' <small>Yokoy., Salleh & Honda 2007</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Aurantiochytrium]]'' <small>Yokoy. & Honda 2007</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Ulkenia]]'' <small>Gaertn. 1977</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Parietichytrium]]'' <small>Yokoy., Salleh & Honda 2007</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Botryochytrium]]'' <small>Yokoy., Salleh & Honda 2007</small>\n*** Genus ''[[Schizochytrium]]'' <small>Goldst. & Belsky emend.
