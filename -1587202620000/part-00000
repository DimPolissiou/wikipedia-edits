Instead, Indian cultural influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region. The interactions between [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points, the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points, the influence was used to take over. Indianization was seen as the total influence of all aspects of Southeast Asian history. Before the take over of the influence of Indian culture, Southeast Asia was seen as a place with no history. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of the cultural commencement in Southeast Asia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Previous source no longer exists (and was self-published)}}\n\n===Theories of Indianization===\n{{Further|Indianization of Southeast Asia}}\nAs conclusive evidence is missing, numerous Indianization theories of [[Southeast Asia]] have emerged since the early 20th century. The central question usually revolves around the main propagator of Indian institutional and cultural ideas in Southeast Asia.\n\nOne theory of the spread of Indianization that focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] [[Sadhaba|traders]] and their role for spreading Indian culture and language into Southeast Asia through trade. There were many trade incentives that brought Vaishya traders to Southeast Asia, the most important of which was gold. During the 4th century C.E., when the first evidence of Indian trader in Southeast Asia, the Indian sub-continent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]]. This made many Vaishya traders look to the seas to acquire new gold, of which Southeast Asia was abundant. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes.<ref name=lukas/>\n\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the warrior class of [[Kshatriya]]. This hypothesis effectively explains state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory hasn't attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=21 May 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\n\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahman]] scholars. These Brahmans brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions and spread them to the elite classes of Southeast Asian polities. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmans were also experts in art and architecture, and political affairs, thus explaining the adoption of many Indian style law codes and architecture into Southeast Asian society<ref name=lukas/>\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also | Literature about Southeast Asia | South Asian literature }}\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=coedes>{{harvtxt|Coedes|1967}}</ref> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity, Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the Hindu Gods. However, once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Religion, authority and legitimacy===\nThe pre-Indic political and social systems in Southeast Asia were marked by a relative indifference towards lineage descent. Hindu God kingship enabled rulers to supersede loyalties, forge cosmopolitan polities and the worship of Shiva and Vishnu was combined with ancestor worship, so that Khmer, Javanese, and Cham rulers claimed semi-divine status as descendants of a God. Hindu traditions, especially the relationship to the sacrality of the land and social structures, are inherent in Hinduism's transnational features. The epic traditions of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a further legitimized a ruler identified with a God who battled and defeated the wrong doers that threaten the ethical order of the world.<ref name=\"oxford press\">{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml | title= Hinduism in Southeast Asia | publisher= Oxford Press |date=28 May 2013 | access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nHinduism does not have a single historical founder, a centralized imperial authority in India proper nor a bureaucratic structure, thus ensuring relative religious independence for the individual ruler.

It was first centered in central Java before moving later to east Java. This kingdom produced numbers of Hindu-Buddhist temples in Java, including [[Borobudur]] Buddhist mandala and the [[Prambanan]] [[Trimurti]] Hindu temple dedicated mainly to [[Shiva]]. The [[Sailendra]]s were the ruling family of this kingdom at an earlier stage in central Java, before being replaced by the [[Isyana Dynasty]].\n* '''[[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]]''': In the 10th century, Mataram challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java, became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries, spreading its influence to the eastern parts of Southeast Asia. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming increasingly important, as demand from European countries grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and so Kediri became a strong trading nation.\n* '''[[Singhasari]]''': In the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. By the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.\n* '''[[Majapahit]]''': The Majapahit empire, centered in East Java, succeeded the [[Singhasari]] empire and flourished in the Indonesian archipelago between the 13th and 15th centuries. Noted for their naval expansion, the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] spanned west\u2013east from Lamuri in [[Aceh]] to Wanin in [[West Papua (province)|Papua]]. Majapahit was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Most of [[Bali]]nese Hindu culture, traditions and civilisations were derived from Majapahit legacy. A large number of Majapahit nobles, priests, and artisans found their home in Bali after the decline of Majapahit to [[Demak Sultanate]].\n* '''[[Galuh Kingdom|Galuh]]''' was an ancient Hindu kingdom in the eastern Tatar Pasundan (now west Java province and Banyumasan region of central Java province), Indonesia. It was established following the collapse of the Tarumanagara kingdom around the 7th century. Traditionally the kingdom of Galuh was associated with the eastern Priangan cultural region, around the [[Citanduy]] and Cimanuk rivers, with its territory spanning from Citarum river on the west, to the Pamali (present-day Brebes river) and Serayu rivers on the east. Its capital was located in Kawali, near present-day Ciamis city.\n* '''[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]''': The Kingdom of Sunda was a Hindu kingdom located in western Java from 669 CE to around 1579 CE, covering the area of present-day Banten, Jakarta, West Java, and the western part of Central Java. According to primary historical records, the Bujangga Manik manuscript, the eastern border of the Sunda Kingdom was the Pamali River (Ci Pamali, the present day Brebes River) and the Serayu River (Ci Sarayu) in Central Java.\n\n===Issues with Indianization===\n====Development in Southeast Asia====\nOne of the major issues with Indianization is the common debate about whether or not Indianization is the reason for the development in South East Asia. Many struggle to date and determine when colonization in Southeast Asia occurred because of the structures and ruins found that were similar to those in India.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=Some Problems in Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia|date=1964|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian History}}</ref> Several books and anthropologists believe that India is seen as the superior culture that influenced a lot of Southeast Asian countries. However, throughout this time that many began to debate, other anthropologists suggested that Southeast Asia had indigenous civilization and the idea of indianization was just seen as a 'national motivation. These debates continued for some time, until the Pacific War, which led to legitimately ending the debates and reviewing Southeast Asia's response to Indianzation.\n\n====Development of caste system====\nAnother main concern for Indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had shown that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}</ref>\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of Indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove Indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the Indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n===Fall of Indianization===\n====Khmer Kingdom====\nBeginning shortly after the 12th century, the Khmer kingdom, one of the first kingdoms that began the dissipation of Indianization started after Jayavarman VII in which expanded a substantial amount of territory, thus going into war with Champa.  Leading into the fall of the Khmer Kingdom, the Khmer political and cultural zones were taken, overthrown, and fallen as well.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehman|first1=Don|title=The Rise & Fall of Southeast Asia's Empires|date=2015|publisher=Lulu|edition=5}}</ref> Not only did Indianization change many cultural and political aspects, but it also changed the spiritual realm as well, creating a type of Northern Culture which began in the early 14th century,  prevalent for its rapid decline in the Indian kingdoms. The decline of Hinduism kingdoms and spark of Buddhist kingdoms led to the formation of orthodox Sinhalese Buddhism and is a key factor leading to the decline of Indianization. Sukhothai and Ceylon are the prominent characters who formulated the center of Buddhism and this became more popularized over Hinduism.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n====Rise of Islam====\nNot only was the spark of Buddhism the driving force for Indianization coming to an end, but Islamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islam coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Indian cultural sphere==\n{{Further|Indosphere}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThe use of ''Greater India'' to refer to an Indian cultural sphere was popularised by a network of Bengali scholars in the 1920s who were all members of the Calcutta-based Greater India Society.

Indian religion, Indian culture, Indian laws, and Indian government moulded the lives of the primitive races all over this wide region, and they imbibed a more elevated moral spirit and a higher intellectual taste through the religion, art, and literature of India.  In short, the people were lifted to a higher plane of civilisation.\"</ref> Some of their formulations were inspired by concurrent excavations in [[Angkor]] by French archaeologists and by the writings of French [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Sylvain L\u00e9vi]].

They called this vast region \"Greater India\" \u2013 a dubious appellation for a region which to a limited degree, but with little permanence, had been influenced by Indian religion, art, architecture, literature and administrative customs. As a consequence of this renewed and extensive interest in Greater India, many Indians came to believe that the entire South and Southeast Asian region formed the cultural progeny of India; now that the sub-continent was reawakening, they felt, India would once again assert its non-political ascendancy over the area... While the idea of reviving the ancient Greater India was never officially endorsed by the Indian National Congress, it enjoyed considerable popularity in nationalist Indian circles. Indeed, Congress leaders made occasional references to Greater India while the organisation's abiding interest in the problems of overseas Indians lent indirect support to the Indian hope of restoring the alleged cultural and spiritual unity of South and Southeast Asia.\"</ref> and [[Hindu nationalism]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Thapar|1968|pp=326\u2013330}} Quote: \"At another level, it was believed that the dynamics of many Asian cultures, particularly those of Southeast Asia, arose from Hindu culture, and the theory of Greater India derived sustenance from Pan-Hinduism. A curious pride was taken in the supposed imperialist past of India, as expressed in sentiments such as these: \"The art of Java and Kambuja was no doubt derived from India and fostered by the Indian rulers of these colonies.\" (Majumdar, R. C. et al.

One key source of this knowledge is a warm tribute paid to [[Sylvain L\u00e9vi]] and his ideas of an expansive, civilising India by Jawaharlal Nehru himself, in his celebrated book, ''The Discovery of India'', which was written during one of Nehru's periods of imprisonment by the British authorities, first published in 1946, and reprinted many times since.... The ideas of both L\u00e9vi and the Greater India scholars were known to Nehru through his close intellectual links with Tagore. Thus L\u00e9vi's notion of ancient Indian voyagers leaving their invisible 'imprints' throughout east and southeast Asia was for Nehru a recapitulation of Tagore's vision of nationhood, that is an idealisation of India as a benign and uncoercive world civiliser and font of global enlightenment.

Pollock's 2006 book ''The Language of the Gods in the World of Men'' makes a case for studying the region as comparable with Latin Europe and argues that the Sanskrit language was its unifying element.\n\nScripts in [[Sanskrit]] discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to [[Southeast Asia]]. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.\n\nSanskrit and related languages have also influenced their [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking neighbors to the north through the spread of Buddhist texts in translation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|van Gulik|1956|p=?}}</ref>   The spread of Buddhism to Tibet allowed many Sanskrit texts to survive only in Tibetan translation (in the [[Tanjur]]).  Buddhism was similarly introduced to China by [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] missionaries sent by the Indian Emperor Ashoka mostly through translations of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] and Classical Sanskrit texts, and many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] contain many [[loan word]]s from Sanskrit, as does [[Khmer language|Khmer]] to a lesser extent. For example, in Thai, [[Ravana|R\u0101va\u1e47a]], the legendary emperor of [[Sri Lanka]], is called 'Thosakanth' which is derived from his Sanskrit name 'Da\u015baka\u1e47\u1e6dha' (\"having ten necks\").\n\nMany Sanskrit loanwords are also found in [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]] particularly the [[Old Javanese|old form]] from which nearly half the vocabulary is derived from the language.<ref>See [[:id: Daftar kata serapan dari bahasa Sansekerta dalam bahasa Indonesia|this page]] from the [[Indonesian Wikipedia]] for a list</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zoetmulder|1982|p=ix}}</ref> Other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|traditional Malay]], [[Indonesian language|modern Indonesian]], also derive [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|much of their vocabulary]] from Sanskrit, albeit to a lesser extent, with a large proportion of words being derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Similarly, [[Philippine languages]] such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] have [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Sanskrit|many Sanskrit loanwords]].\n\nA Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word ''[[Indonesian language|bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101]]'', or spoken language, which is used to mean language in general, for example ''bahasa'' in Malay, Indonesian and [[Tausug language|Tausug]], ''basa'' in Javanese, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], ''phasa'' in Thai and Lao, ''bhasa'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and ''phiesa'' in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].\n\nThe utilization of [[Sanskrit]] has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. [[Sanskrit]] terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Coedes|1967|p=98}} The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of [[Vietnam]] once embraced the [[Sanskrit]] dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva.

In 1962 Indonesia changed the colonial name of [[New Guinea]]n city of Hollandia to [[Jayapura]] (\"glorious city\"), Orange mountain range to [[Jayawijaya Mountains]].\n* Malaysia named their new government seat as [[Putrajaya]] (\"prince of glory\") in 1999.\n\n==Historiography of Indianization==\n===Indianization of Southeast Asia===\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region. The prevalent interpretation caused because of the ontological differences, the fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre-colonial Asia and the conclusion from it was that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies had caused innovation to become prey to tyranny and had rendered the history of the region cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n\nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such as the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false | title=Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830| isbn=9781139437622| last1=Lieberman| first1=Victor| date=2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Caste systems===\nAnother main concern for [[Indian culture|Indianization]] was the understanding and development of caste systems.

This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized {{citation needed|date=January 2020}} and able to flourish their own interests.

Instead, Indian cultural influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region. The interactions between [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points, the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points, the influence was used to take over. Indianization was seen as the total influence of all aspects of Southeast Asian history. Before the take over of the influence of Indian culture, Southeast Asia was seen as a place with no history. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of the cultural commencement in Southeast Asia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Previous source no longer exists (and was self-published)}}\n\n===Theories of Indianization===\n{{Further|Indianization of Southeast Asia}}\nAs conclusive evidence is missing, numerous Indianization theories of [[Southeast Asia]] have emerged since the early 20th century. The central question usually revolves around the main propagator of Indian institutional and cultural ideas in Southeast Asia.\n\nOne theory of the spread of Indianization that focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] [[Sadhaba|traders]] and their role for spreading Indian culture and language into Southeast Asia through trade. There were many trade incentives that brought Vaishya traders to Southeast Asia, the most important of which was gold. During the 4th century C.E., when the first evidence of Indian trader in Southeast Asia, the Indian sub-continent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]]. This made many Vaishya traders look to the seas to acquire new gold, of which Southeast Asia was abundant. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes.<ref name=lukas/>\n\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the warrior class of [[Kshatriya]]. This hypothesis effectively explains state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory hasn't attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=21 May 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\n\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahman]] scholars. These Brahmans brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions and spread them to the elite classes of Southeast Asian polities. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmans were also experts in art and architecture, and political affairs, thus explaining the adoption of many Indian style law codes and architecture into Southeast Asian society<ref name=lukas/>\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also | Literature about Southeast Asia | South Asian literature }}\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=coedes>{{harvtxt|Coedes|1967}}</ref> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity, Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the Hindu Gods. However, once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Religion, authority and legitimacy===\nThe pre-Indic political and social systems in Southeast Asia were marked by a relative indifference towards lineage descent. Hindu God kingship enabled rulers to supersede loyalties, forge cosmopolitan polities and the worship of Shiva and Vishnu was combined with ancestor worship, so that Khmer, Javanese, and Cham rulers claimed semi-divine status as descendants of a God. Hindu traditions, especially the relationship to the sacrality of the land and social structures, are inherent in Hinduism's transnational features. The epic traditions of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a further legitimized a ruler identified with a God who battled and defeated the wrong doers that threaten the ethical order of the world.<ref name=\"oxford press\">{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml | title= Hinduism in Southeast Asia | publisher= Oxford Press |date=28 May 2013 | access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nHinduism does not have a single historical founder, a centralized imperial authority in India proper nor a bureaucratic structure, thus ensuring relative religious independence for the individual ruler.

It is likely that Hindu and Buddhist traders, priests, and princes traveled to Southeast Asia from India in the first few centuries of the Common Era and eventually settled there. Strong impulse most certainly came from the region's ruling classes who invited Brahmans to serve at their courts as priests, astrologers and advisers.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/The-spread-of-Hinduism-in-Southeast-Asia-and-the-Pacific | title=The spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the Pacific | publisher= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= | access-date=20 December 2016 }}</ref> Divinity and royalty were closely connected in these polities as Hindu rituals validated the powers of the monarch.

It was the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in Central Java, and together with Kutai and Tarumanagara are the oldest kingdoms in Indonesian history.\n* '''[[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]]''' was a classical Southeast Asian kingdom. The primary sources for much of the information on the kingdom are the New History of the Tang, and the memoirs of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing who visited in 671 CE, and states that it was \"absorbed\" by Srivijaya by 692 CE, but had \"broken away\" by the end of the eleventh century according to Chao Jukua. The exact location of the kingdom is the subject of studies among historians.\n* '''[[Srivijaya]]''': From the 7th to 13th centuries Srivijaya, a maritime empire centered on the island of [[Sumatra]] in Indonesia, had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers from Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa to the [[Sailendra]]s. A stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia. I Ching reports that the kingdom was home to more than a thousand Buddhist scholars. A notable Buddhist scholar of local origin, [[Dharmakirti]], taught Buddhist philosophy in Srivijaya and [[Nalanda]] (in India), and was the teacher of [[Atisha]]. Most of the time, this Buddhist [[ethnic Malay|Malay]] empire enjoyed cordial relationship with China and the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Bengal]], and the 860 CE [[Nalanda inscription]] records that Maharaja [[Balaputra]] dedicated a monastery at [[Nalanda|Nalanda university]] near Pala territory.

The name had been forgotten until scholars recognized Tambralinga as Nagara Sri Dharmaraja (Nakhon Si Thammarat). Early records are scarce but its duration is estimated to range from the seventh to the fourteenth century. Tambralinga first sent tribute to the emperor of the Tang dynasty in 616 CE. In Sanskrit, Tambra means \"red\" and linga means \"symbol\", typically representing the divine energy of Shiva.\n* '''[[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]]''': The Medang-i-Bhumi Mataram Kingdom flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was first centered in central Java before moving later to east Java. This kingdom produced numbers of Hindu-Buddhist temples in Java, including [[Borobudur]] Buddhist mandala and the [[Prambanan]] [[Trimurti]] Hindu temple dedicated mainly to [[Shiva]]. The [[Sailendra]]s were the ruling family of this kingdom at an earlier stage in central Java, before being replaced by the [[Isyana Dynasty]].\n* '''[[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]]''': In the 10th century, Mataram challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java, became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries, spreading its influence to the eastern parts of Southeast Asia. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming increasingly important, as demand from European countries grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and so Kediri became a strong trading nation.\n* '''[[Singhasari]]''': In the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. By the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.\n* '''[[Majapahit]]''': The Majapahit empire, centered in East Java, succeeded the [[Singhasari]] empire and flourished in the Indonesian archipelago between the 13th and 15th centuries. Noted for their naval expansion, the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] spanned west\u2013east from Lamuri in [[Aceh]] to Wanin in [[West Papua (province)|Papua]]. Majapahit was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Most of [[Bali]]nese Hindu culture, traditions and civilisations were derived from Majapahit legacy. A large number of Majapahit nobles, priests, and artisans found their home in Bali after the decline of Majapahit to [[Demak Sultanate]].\n* '''[[Galuh Kingdom|Galuh]]''' was an ancient Hindu kingdom in the eastern Tatar Pasundan (now west Java province and Banyumasan region of central Java province), Indonesia. It was established following the collapse of the Tarumanagara kingdom around the 7th century. Traditionally the kingdom of Galuh was associated with the eastern Priangan cultural region, around the [[Citanduy]] and Cimanuk rivers, with its territory spanning from Citarum river on the west, to the Pamali (present-day Brebes river) and Serayu rivers on the east. Its capital was located in Kawali, near present-day Ciamis city.\n* '''[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]''': The Kingdom of Sunda was a Hindu kingdom located in western Java from 669 CE to around 1579 CE, covering the area of present-day Banten, Jakarta, West Java, and the western part of Central Java. According to primary historical records, the Bujangga Manik manuscript, the eastern border of the Sunda Kingdom was the Pamali River (Ci Pamali, the present day Brebes River) and the Serayu River (Ci Sarayu) in Central Java.\n\n===Issues with Indianization===\n====Development in Southeast Asia====\nOne of the major issues with Indianization is the common debate about whether or not Indianization is the reason for the development in South East Asia. Many struggle to date and determine when colonization in Southeast Asia occurred because of the structures and ruins found that were similar to those in India.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=Some Problems in Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia|date=1964|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian History}}</ref> Several books and anthropologists believe that India is seen as the superior culture that influenced a lot of Southeast Asian countries. However, throughout this time that many began to debate, other anthropologists suggested that Southeast Asia had indigenous civilization and the idea of indianization was just seen as a 'national motivation. These debates continued for some time, until the Pacific War, which led to legitimately ending the debates and reviewing Southeast Asia's response to Indianzation.\n\n====Development of caste system====\nAnother main concern for Indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had shown that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}</ref>\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of Indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove Indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the Indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n===Fall of Indianization===\n====Khmer Kingdom====\nBeginning shortly after the 12th century, the Khmer kingdom, one of the first kingdoms that began the dissipation of Indianization started after Jayavarman VII in which expanded a substantial amount of territory, thus going into war with Champa.  Leading into the fall of the Khmer Kingdom, the Khmer political and cultural zones were taken, overthrown, and fallen as well.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehman|first1=Don|title=The Rise & Fall of Southeast Asia's Empires|date=2015|publisher=Lulu|edition=5}}</ref> Not only did Indianization change many cultural and political aspects, but it also changed the spiritual realm as well, creating a type of Northern Culture which began in the early 14th century,  prevalent for its rapid decline in the Indian kingdoms. The decline of Hinduism kingdoms and spark of Buddhist kingdoms led to the formation of orthodox Sinhalese Buddhism and is a key factor leading to the decline of Indianization. Sukhothai and Ceylon are the prominent characters who formulated the center of Buddhism and this became more popularized over Hinduism.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n====Rise of Islam====\nNot only was the spark of Buddhism the driving force for Indianization coming to an end, but Islamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islam coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Indian cultural sphere==\n{{Further|Indosphere}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThe use of ''Greater India'' to refer to an Indian cultural sphere was popularised by a network of Bengali scholars in the 1920s who were all members of the Calcutta-based Greater India Society.

They called this vast region \"Greater India\" \u2013 a dubious appellation for a region which to a limited degree, but with little permanence, had been influenced by Indian religion, art, architecture, literature and administrative customs. As a consequence of this renewed and extensive interest in Greater India, many Indians came to believe that the entire South and Southeast Asian region formed the cultural progeny of India; now that the sub-continent was reawakening, they felt, India would once again assert its non-political ascendancy over the area... While the idea of reviving the ancient Greater India was never officially endorsed by the Indian National Congress, it enjoyed considerable popularity in nationalist Indian circles. Indeed, Congress leaders made occasional references to Greater India while the organisation's abiding interest in the problems of overseas Indians lent indirect support to the Indian hope of restoring the alleged cultural and spiritual unity of South and Southeast Asia.\"</ref> and [[Hindu nationalism]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Thapar|1968|pp=326\u2013330}} Quote: \"At another level, it was believed that the dynamics of many Asian cultures, particularly those of Southeast Asia, arose from Hindu culture, and the theory of Greater India derived sustenance from Pan-Hinduism.

The ideas of both L\u00e9vi and the Greater India scholars were known to Nehru through his close intellectual links with Tagore. Thus L\u00e9vi's notion of ancient Indian voyagers leaving their invisible 'imprints' throughout east and southeast Asia was for Nehru a recapitulation of Tagore's vision of nationhood, that is an idealisation of India as a benign and uncoercive world civiliser and font of global enlightenment.

The [[P\u0101li|Pali]] and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature. Southeast Asia had developed some prosperous and very powerful colonial empires that contributed to Hindu-Buddhist artistic creations and architectural developments. Art and architectural creations that rivaled those built in India, especially in its sheer size, design and aesthetic achievements. The notable examples are Borobudur in Java and Angkor monuments in Cambodia. The Srivijaya Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence in the region.\n\nA defining characteristic of the cultural link between Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent was the adoption of ancient Indian [[Vedic period|Vedic]]/Hindu and Buddhist culture and philosophy into [[Myanmar]], [[Tibet]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

Pollock's 2006 book ''The Language of the Gods in the World of Men'' makes a case for studying the region as comparable with Latin Europe and argues that the Sanskrit language was its unifying element.\n\nScripts in [[Sanskrit]] discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to [[Southeast Asia]]. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos, and Cambodia are variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.\n\nSanskrit and related languages have also influenced their [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking neighbors to the north through the spread of Buddhist texts in translation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|van Gulik|1956|p=?}}</ref>   The spread of Buddhism to Tibet allowed many Sanskrit texts to survive only in Tibetan translation (in the [[Tanjur]]).  Buddhism was similarly introduced to China by [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] missionaries sent by the Indian Emperor Ashoka mostly through translations of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] and Classical Sanskrit texts, and many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] contain many [[loan word]]s from Sanskrit, as does [[Khmer language|Khmer]] to a lesser extent. For example, in Thai, [[Ravana|R\u0101va\u1e47a]], the legendary emperor of [[Sri Lanka]], is called 'Thosakanth' which is derived from his Sanskrit name 'Da\u015baka\u1e47\u1e6dha' (\"having ten necks\").\n\nMany Sanskrit loanwords are also found in [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]] particularly the [[Old Javanese|old form]] from which nearly half the vocabulary is derived from the language.<ref>See [[:id: Daftar kata serapan dari bahasa Sansekerta dalam bahasa Indonesia|this page]] from the [[Indonesian Wikipedia]] for a list</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zoetmulder|1982|p=ix}}</ref> Other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|traditional Malay]], [[Indonesian language|modern Indonesian]], also derive [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|much of their vocabulary]] from Sanskrit, albeit to a lesser extent, with a large proportion of words being derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Similarly, [[Philippine languages]] such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] have [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Sanskrit|many Sanskrit loanwords]].\n\nA Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word ''[[Indonesian language|bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101]]'', or spoken language, which is used to mean language in general, for example ''bahasa'' in Malay, Indonesian and [[Tausug language|Tausug]], ''basa'' in Javanese, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], ''phasa'' in Thai and Lao, ''bhasa'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and ''phiesa'' in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].\n\nThe utilization of [[Sanskrit]] has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. [[Sanskrit]] terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Coedes|1967|p=98}} The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of [[Vietnam]] once embraced the [[Sanskrit]] dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \"reincarnations or descendants\" of the [[Hindu]] gods. However once [[Buddhism]] began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.\n\n===Linguistic commonalities===\n* In the [[Malay Archipelago]]: [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] have absorbed a large amount of [[Sanskrit]] loanwords into their respective lexicons  (see: [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|Sanskrit loan words in Indonesian]]).

An example is how the name of the late King of Thailand, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], is spelled in Sanskrit as \"Bhumibol\"\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e25, yet is pronounced in Thai as \"Phumipon\" \u0e1e\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e19 using Thai-Sanskrit pronunciation rules since the original Sanskrit sounds do not exist in Thai. <!--the source says: \"which in Sanskrit would be written Bhumibal Atulyatej\"--><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2003/08/15/Culture/3595 |title=King Bhumibol and King Janak |last1=Sharma\n |first1=Sudhindra  |date= |work=nepalitimes.com |publisher=Himalmedia Private Limited |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Toponyms===\n* [[Suvarnabhumi]] is a toponym that has been historically associated with Southeast Asia. In Sanskrit, it means \"The Land of Gold\". Thailand's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] is named after this toponym, signifying its intent to be a major transport hub of Southeast Asia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n* Several of Indonesian [[toponym]]s have Indian parallel or origin, such as [[Madura]] with [[Mathura]], [[Serayu]] and [[Sarayu]] river, [[Semeru]] with [[Sumeru]] mountain, [[Kalingga]] from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga Kingdom]], and [[Yogyakarta|Ngayogyakarta]] from [[Ayodhya]].\n* Siamese ancient city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] also derived from Ramayana's Ayodhya.\n* Names of places could simply render their Sanskrit origin, such as [[Singapore]], from Singapura (''Singha-pura'' the \"lion city\"), [[Jakarta]] from ''Jaya'' and ''kreta'' (\"complete victory\").\n* Some of the Indonesian regencies such as [[Indragiri Hulu Regency|Indragiri Hulu]] and [[Indragiri Hilir Regency|Indragiri Hilir]] derived from Indragiri River, Indragiri itself means \"mountain of [[Indra]]\".\n* Some Thai toponyms also often have Indian parallels or Sanskrit origin, although the spellings are adapted to the Siamese tongue, such as [[Ratchaburi]] from ''Raja-puri'' (\"king's city\"), and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] from ''Nagara Sri Dharmaraja''.\n* The tendency to use Sanskrit for modern [[neologism]] also continued to modern day. In 1962 Indonesia changed the colonial name of [[New Guinea]]n city of Hollandia to [[Jayapura]] (\"glorious city\"), Orange mountain range to [[Jayawijaya Mountains]].\n* Malaysia named their new government seat as [[Putrajaya]] (\"prince of glory\") in 1999.\n\n==Historiography of Indianization==\n===Indianization of Southeast Asia===\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region. The prevalent interpretation caused because of the ontological differences, the fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre-colonial Asia and the conclusion from it was that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies had caused innovation to become prey to tyranny and had rendered the history of the region cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n\nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such as the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false | title=Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830| isbn=9781139437622| last1=Lieberman| first1=Victor| date=2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Caste systems===\nAnother main concern for [[Indian culture|Indianization]] was the understanding and development of caste systems.

Though not using the exact terminology, he holds to [[conditional election]],{{sfn|Forlines|p=311|ps=.

Yet the Scriptures are full of instances of prevenient grace. See how this grace operates upon Nicodemus, upon the Samaritan woman before life and faith were kindled in them. Grace operates according to a certain law or order and never effects regeneration all at one blow.

The bridge crosses on the river just before it enters Lake Burrinjuck, which has been created by the [[Burrinjuck Dam]]. The bridge is a key part of the road between [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and Wee Jasper, and from there, to [[Tumut]]. The bridge is located approximately {{convert|26|km}} from Yass and {{convert|22|km}} from Wee Jasper. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. Under the {{Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|ha197786|Heritage Act, 1977|170}}, the bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register|New South Wales State agency heritage register]] on 18 August 2005.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n== History ==\nA metal MacDonald [[truss bridge]], also known as the Taemas Bridge, was built {{circa|1888}}, located {{convert|2|mi|km|0|order=flip}} downriver from the existing Taemas Bridge.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index5a7d.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/110582/20101116-0004/www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index5a7d.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 November 2010 |title=Taemas Bridge over Murrumbidgee River |work=RTA Heritage and Conservation Register |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=205147# |title=Photo of old Taemas Bridge in 1915 |date= |format= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> In {{circa|1924}} this bridge was raised {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} and extended to {{convert|885|ft|m|0|order=flip}}  with the addition of numerous timber approach [[Span (architecture)|spans]] by the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission in association with the construction of [[Burrinjuck Dam]]. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in May 1925. The local member of the NSW Parliament, [[Jack Tully]], promised to have the destroyed Taemas Bridge replaced as soon as possible.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n \nIn the interim, the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] (PWD) established a [[Cable ferry|punt]] service adjacent to the destroyed bridge until such time as a new bridge could be constructed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1207287 |title=Taemas Bridge to be Rebuilt |work=[[Canberra Times]] |date=24 September 1926 |page=9 |access-date= |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref> The punt remained in operation for almost four years later, until it was swept away in April 1929.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16551862 |title=Graziers Requests |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 July 1929 |page=12 |access-date= |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref> A low-level bridge was constructed in 1929, but the water rose and destroyed it that same year. In July 1929, another punt was then established to provide alternative access, and was worked hard carrying wool and other produce.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe site of the current Taemas Bridge was selected by the Public Works Department and is located approximately {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} upriver from the former bridge site. This led to a longer road route, yet enabled a shorter bridge to be constructed in a location were flood levels were expected to be lower. The current bridge was completed in 1931 and is over {{convert|200|m}} long.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n \nAfter several years of inaction, the [[Goodradigbee Shire|Goodradigbee]] and [[Municipality of Yass|Yass]] councils organised a protest meeting, and the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] asked [[Tulloch Limited|Tulloch's Phoenix Ironworks]] in [[Sydney]] to order steel for the bridge. Steel members show rolling marks of [[Dorman Long|Dorman Long & Co]], so were presumably imported from [[Middlesbrough]], England. [[Braas Monier Building Group|Monier Pipe and Reinforced Concrete Works]] constructed piers and installed the bridge. Once constructed, Gilroy and Robson Ltd gravelled the bridge approaches ready for opening.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\nThis two-lane steel through truss bridge spans the Murrumbidgee River in the upper reaches of the Burrinjuck Dam storage. Its height has been set to clear the large floods to which the valley is subjected (and which destroyed its predecessor).<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nThe bridge has four main spans and two approach spans. Approach spans are supported by six {{convert|13.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} longitudinal steel beams (or stringers) which in turn support a [[reinforced concrete]] deck. There are cross girders at midspan to stabilise the beams. The main spans are {{convert|45.7|m|ft|0}}, having eight bays in a [[Pratt truss]] configuration. Connections are by riveting, and the trusses make extensive use of lattice bracing to produce compound members. Tension members are stabilised by riveted Vierendeel plates.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nThe comparatively narrow {{convert|5.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deck of the bridge is unsurfaced concrete, edged by kerbs with pipe handrails with infill wire netting.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nThe substantial piers have two cylindrical legs founded on rock with up to three lateral tie beams. The lower sections bell out to larger diameter below the bottom cross beam. Above the upper cross beam the columns are capped with octagonal capitals which support the bridge bearings which are of rocker type.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nMonumental style is used in the abutments which are of U shape, but with bold corners capped with imposing endposts. The side faces of the abutment and endposts are inclined.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\nThe bridge was opened in 1931 and cost [[Australian pound|A\u20a4]]60,895. Even after the new bridge was opened some locals still [[Ford (crossing)|forded]] the river near the former bridge if they could, to save petrol from the extra distance required by road to reach the new bridge.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> There is a carpark at the southern end of the bridge, from which the Murrumbidgee River can be accessed.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nThe Taemas Bridge has historical, social, technical, aesthetic and representative significance within the Yass-Tumut-Yarrowlumla-Gundagai area. It has provided a crossing of a major waterway, the Murrumbidgee River, for over seventy years and its long term reliability has facilitated the agricultural activities and economies of the surrounding areas. The history of transport in the region has been shaped by the Murrumbidgee and the difficulty of providing crossings of this large and flood prone waterway. The bridge represents a significant technical achievement, its robust design and its positioning, with the site of the former crossing downstream and documentary sources, demonstrate the intelligence, effort and investment required to construct a lasting and reliable crossing of this major and dynamic waterway. The bridge is of aesthetic significance, being an impressive structure of considerable length crossing a major waterway and having landmark qualities on the Yass-Tumut road. The monumental style of the abutments reflects the importance ascribed to the crossing by the Public Works Department and the community. The bridge has local social significance. The loss of the previous bridge in record flood was a major blow to the local community using this important transport and communication route. The community was involved in the debate surrounding the siting of the existing bridge, and continued to express dismay at the lengthy delay in its construction. The bridge is a landmark to which local travellers are likely to attach a sense of place and self. The bridge is a good, intact example of large scale truss design in the early to mid twentieth century.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\nTaemas Bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register|New South Wales State agency heritage register]] on 18 August 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nTaemas Bridge is historically significant as an important transport link in the State's south west. It has provided a reliable crossing of a major waterway, the Murrumbidgee River, between the districts of Yass and Tumut for over seventy years. The history of transport in the region has been shaped by the Murrumbidgee and the difficulty of providing crossings of this large and flood prone waterway. The story of the Taemas Bridge, a long awaited replacement of an equally ambitious bridge washed away in flood, is articulate about the interaction between the communities of the Yass-Tumut area and their environment and also about the efforts and strategies of the government in providing reliable access on important rural transport routes in NSW. The long term reliability of the Taemas bridge has facilitated the agricultural activities and economies of the surrounding areas.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Taemas Bridge represents a significant technical achievement. The design of this robust metal bridge and its positioning, with the site of the former crossing downstream and documentary sources, demonstrate the intelligence, effort and investment required to construct a lasting and reliable crossing of this major and dynamic waterway. The bridge is of aesthetic significance, being an impressive structure of considerable length crossing a major waterway and having landmark qualities on the Yass-Tumut road. The monumental style of the abutments reflects the importance ascribed to the crossing by the Public Works Department and the community.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe bridge has local social significance. The loss of the previous bridge in record flood was a major blow to the local community using this important transport and communication route.

The bridge crosses on the river just before it enters Lake Burrinjuck, which has been created by the [[Burrinjuck Dam]]. The bridge is a key part of the road between [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and Wee Jasper, and from there, to [[Tumut]]. The bridge is located approximately {{convert|26|km}} from Yass and {{convert|22|km}} from Wee Jasper. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. Under the {{Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|ha197786|Heritage Act, 1977|170}}, the bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register|New South Wales State agency heritage register]] on 18 August 2005.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n== History ==\nA metal MacDonald [[truss bridge]], also known as the Taemas Bridge, was built {{circa|1888}}, located {{convert|2|mi|km|0|order=flip}} downriver from the existing Taemas Bridge.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index5a7d.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/110582/20101116-0004/www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index5a7d.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 November 2010 |title=Taemas Bridge over Murrumbidgee River |work=RTA Heritage and Conservation Register |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=205147# |title=Photo of old Taemas Bridge in 1915 |date= |format= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> In {{circa|1924}} this bridge was raised {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} and extended to {{convert|885|ft|m|0|order=flip}}  with the addition of numerous timber approach [[Span (architecture)|spans]] by the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission in association with the construction of [[Burrinjuck Dam]]. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in May 1925. The local member of the NSW Parliament, [[Jack Tully]], promised to have the destroyed Taemas Bridge replaced as soon as possible.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n \nIn the interim, the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] (PWD) established a [[Cable ferry|punt]] service adjacent to the destroyed bridge until such time as a new bridge could be constructed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1207287 |title=Taemas Bridge to be Rebuilt |work=[[Canberra Times]] |date=24 September 1926 |page=9 |access-date= |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref> The punt remained in operation for almost four years later, until it was swept away in April 1929.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16551862 |title=Graziers Requests |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 July 1929 |page=12 |access-date= |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref> A low-level bridge was constructed in 1929, but the water rose and destroyed it that same year. In July 1929, another punt was then established to provide alternative access, and was worked hard carrying wool and other produce.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe site of the current Taemas Bridge was selected by the Public Works Department and is located approximately {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} upriver from the former bridge site. This led to a longer road route, yet enabled a shorter bridge to be constructed in a location were flood levels were expected to be lower. The current bridge was completed in 1931 and is over {{convert|200|m}} long.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n \nAfter several years of inaction, the [[Goodradigbee Shire|Goodradigbee]] and [[Municipality of Yass|Yass]] councils organised a protest meeting, and the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] asked [[Tulloch Limited|Tulloch's Phoenix Ironworks]] in [[Sydney]] to order steel for the bridge. Steel members show rolling marks of [[Dorman Long|Dorman Long & Co]], so were presumably imported from [[Middlesbrough]], England. [[Braas Monier Building Group|Monier Pipe and Reinforced Concrete Works]] constructed piers and installed the bridge. Once constructed, Gilroy and Robson Ltd gravelled the bridge approaches ready for opening.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\nThis two-lane steel through truss bridge spans the Murrumbidgee River in the upper reaches of the Burrinjuck Dam storage. Its height has been set to clear the large floods to which the valley is subjected (and which destroyed its predecessor).<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nThe bridge has four main spans and two approach spans. Approach spans are supported by six {{convert|13.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} longitudinal steel beams (or stringers) which in turn support a [[reinforced concrete]] deck. There are cross girders at midspan to stabilise the beams. The main spans are {{convert|45.7|m|ft|0}}, having eight bays in a [[Pratt truss]] configuration. Connections are by riveting, and the trusses make extensive use of lattice bracing to produce compound members. Tension members are stabilised by riveted Vierendeel plates.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nThe comparatively narrow {{convert|5.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deck of the bridge is unsurfaced concrete, edged by kerbs with pipe handrails with infill wire netting.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nThe substantial piers have two cylindrical legs founded on rock with up to three lateral tie beams. The lower sections bell out to larger diameter below the bottom cross beam. Above the upper cross beam the columns are capped with octagonal capitals which support the bridge bearings which are of rocker type.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> \n\nMonumental style is used in the abutments which are of U shape, but with bold corners capped with imposing endposts. The side faces of the abutment and endposts are inclined.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\nThe bridge was opened in 1931 and cost [[Australian pound|A\u20a4]]60,895. Even after the new bridge was opened some locals still [[Ford (crossing)|forded]] the river near the former bridge if they could, to save petrol from the extra distance required by road to reach the new bridge.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/> There is a carpark at the southern end of the bridge, from which the Murrumbidgee River can be accessed.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nThe Taemas Bridge has historical, social, technical, aesthetic and representative significance within the Yass-Tumut-Yarrowlumla-Gundagai area. It has provided a crossing of a major waterway, the Murrumbidgee River, for over seventy years and its long term reliability has facilitated the agricultural activities and economies of the surrounding areas. The history of transport in the region has been shaped by the Murrumbidgee and the difficulty of providing crossings of this large and flood prone waterway. The bridge represents a significant technical achievement, its robust design and its positioning, with the site of the former crossing downstream and documentary sources, demonstrate the intelligence, effort and investment required to construct a lasting and reliable crossing of this major and dynamic waterway. The bridge is of aesthetic significance, being an impressive structure of considerable length crossing a major waterway and having landmark qualities on the Yass-Tumut road. The monumental style of the abutments reflects the importance ascribed to the crossing by the Public Works Department and the community. The bridge has local social significance. The loss of the previous bridge in record flood was a major blow to the local community using this important transport and communication route. The community was involved in the debate surrounding the siting of the existing bridge, and continued to express dismay at the lengthy delay in its construction. The bridge is a landmark to which local travellers are likely to attach a sense of place and self. The bridge is a good, intact example of large scale truss design in the early to mid twentieth century.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\nTaemas Bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register|New South Wales State agency heritage register]] on 18 August 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nTaemas Bridge is historically significant as an important transport link in the State's south west. It has provided a reliable crossing of a major waterway, the Murrumbidgee River, between the districts of Yass and Tumut for over seventy years. The history of transport in the region has been shaped by the Murrumbidgee and the difficulty of providing crossings of this large and flood prone waterway. The story of the Taemas Bridge, a long awaited replacement of an equally ambitious bridge washed away in flood, is articulate about the interaction between the communities of the Yass-Tumut area and their environment and also about the efforts and strategies of the government in providing reliable access on important rural transport routes in NSW. The long term reliability of the Taemas bridge has facilitated the agricultural activities and economies of the surrounding areas.<ref name=\"NSWSHR\"/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Taemas Bridge represents a significant technical achievement.
