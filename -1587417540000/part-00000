It serves as the principal settlement of the [[London Borough of Harrow]], lying about {{convert|10.5|mi}} northwest of [[Charing Cross]], and {{convert|5.4|mi}} south of [[Watford]]. The entire town, including its localities [[Harrow on the Hill]], [[Harrow Weald]], [[Headstone, London|Headstone]], [[North Harrow]], [[Kenton, London|Kenton]], [[Rayners Lane]], [[South Harrow]], [[Wealdstone]] and [[West Harrow]], had a population of 149,246 as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], whereas the wider borough had a population of 250,149.\n\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Middlesex]], Harrow was a municipal borough before it became a part of Greater London in 1965. The modern town of Harrow is what was historically called Greenhill, a former hamlet at the foot of the {{convert|408|ft|m}} Harrow Hill settlement. With the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] in the 19th century, the centre of Harrow moved to Greenhill<ref>http://patfield.com/heathfield/HeathfieldCentenary.pdf</ref> and it grew as the unofficial \"capital\" of the [[Metro-land]] suburbia.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia</ref> The historic centre of Harrow, often distinguished as [[Harrow on the Hill]], is a conservation area with [[listed building]]s of [[Georgian architecture]] and home to the famous [[Harrow School]]. The modern-day town of Harrow is an established commercial centre of outer North West London.<ref>https://www.allsop.co.uk/resources/2019/04/Next-Harrow.pdf?x89233</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nHarrow's name comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hearg'' = \"(heathen) temple\", which was probably on the hill of Harrow, where [[St Mary's Church, Harrow on the Hill|St. Mary's Church]] stands today.<ref>Room, Adrian: \"Dictionary of Place-Names in the British Isles\", Bloomsbury, 1988. {{ISBN|0-7475-0170-X}}</ref> The name has been studied in detail by [[Keith Briggs (mathematician)|Keith Briggs]].<ref>Briggs, Keith \"Harrow\", Journal of the English Place-name Society, volume 42 (2010), 43\u201364</ref>\n\nThe original Greenhill hamlet derived its name from the hollow (which has been built over from the 19th century) to the north of Harrow Hill. It was not recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] but was mentioned as early as 1334 as ''\"Grenehulle\"''. In addition, one or more families bearing the \"Greenhulle\" or \"Greenhill\" surname lived there from at least 1247, and are likely to have taken their name from this location.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref> The name \"Greenhill\" survives and the local council has continued the name by using it for \"Greenhill Way\" a road which by-passes the mainly-pedestrianised and modernised shopping area based around College Road and St Anns Road. The name is also still used for the local [[electoral ward]].\n\nIt is possible that Greenhill went by an even older name, Norbury, c. 1300, but the hamlet of Norbury has not been identified with certainty as of yet.

The modern town of Harrow is what was historically called Greenhill, a former hamlet at the foot of the {{convert|408|ft|m}} Harrow Hill settlement. With the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] in the 19th century, the centre of Harrow moved to Greenhill<ref>http://patfield.com/heathfield/HeathfieldCentenary.pdf</ref> and it grew as the unofficial \"capital\" of the [[Metro-land]] suburbia.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia</ref> The historic centre of Harrow, often distinguished as [[Harrow on the Hill]], is a conservation area with [[listed building]]s of [[Georgian architecture]] and home to the famous [[Harrow School]].

It was not recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] but was mentioned as early as 1334 as ''\"Grenehulle\"''. In addition, one or more families bearing the \"Greenhulle\" or \"Greenhill\" surname lived there from at least 1247, and are likely to have taken their name from this location.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref> The name \"Greenhill\" survives and the local council has continued the name by using it for \"Greenhill Way\" a road which by-passes the mainly-pedestrianised and modernised shopping area based around College Road and St Anns Road. The name is also still used for the local [[electoral ward]].\n\nIt is possible that Greenhill went by an even older name, Norbury, c. 1300, but the hamlet of Norbury has not been identified with certainty as of yet.

The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a plantain leaf, and using the right hand to eat. After the meal the plantain leaf is discarded but becomes food for free-ranging cattle and goats. A meal (called ''Saapadu'') consists of rice with other typical Tamil dishes on a plantain leaf.

Also growing in popularity are stainless steel trays \u2013 plates with a selection of different dishes in small bowls.\n\nTamil food is characterized by ''[[tiffin]]'', which is a light food taken for breakfast or dinner, and ''meals'' which are usually taken during lunch.

They have influenced Kerala as well in their Kootu, Arachi vitta sambhar and molagootals.

Historically vegetarian, the cuisine is known for its milder flavor and avoidance of onion and garlic (although this practice appears to be disappearing with time). After a light morning meal of [[filter coffee]] and different varieties of porridges (oatmeal and ''janata kanji'' are immensely popular), the main meal of the day, lunch/brunch is usually at 11 am and typically follows a two-three course meal structure. Steamed rice is the main dish, and is always accompanied by a seasonally steamed/sauteed vegetable ([[poriyal]]), and two or three types of tamarind stews, the most popular being [[Sambar (dish)|sambhar]] and [[rasam]]. The meal typically ends with ''[[Curd rice|thair sadham]] (''rice with yogurt), usually served with pickled mangoes or lemons. ''Tiffin'' is the second meal of the day and features several breakfast favorites such as idli, rava idli, upma, dosa varieties, vada and is usually accompanied by ''chai''. Dinner is the simplest meal of the day, typically involving leftovers from either lunch or tiffin. Fresh seasonal fruit consumed in the state include bananas, papaya, honeydew and canteloupe melons, jackfruit, mangos, apples, ''kasturi'' oranges, pomegranates, and ''nongu (''hearts of palm).\n\n===Telangana===\n{{Main|Telugu cuisine|Hyderabadi cuisine}}\n[[File:Chickenbiryani.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Hyderabadi Biryani]]'' from the city of Hyderabad]]\nThe cuisine of [[Telangana]] consists of the [[Telugu cuisine]], of Telangana's [[Telugu people]] as well as [[Hyderabadi cuisine]] (also known as Nizami cuisine), of Telangana's [[Hyderabadi Muslims|Hyderabadi Muslim community]].<ref name=\"Dubey and Pat\">{{cite book|title=The Indian cuisine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xiwkbgJbSQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=PHI Learning|last=Dubey|first=Krishna gopal|page=233|isbn=978-81-203-4170-8|year=2011|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Pat\">{{cite book|title=India: food & cooking: The ultimate book on Indian cuisine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orHWFRMKf4EC&|publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]]|last=Chapman|first=Pat|pages=38\u201339|isbn=978-1-84537-619-2|year=2009|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> [[Hyderabadi cuisine|Hyderabadi food]] is based heavily on non-vegetarian ingredients, while [[Telugu cuisine|Telugu food]] is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients.

The unique taste and flavor of Malwani cuisine comes from Malwani'' masala'' and use of coconut and [[Garcinia indica|''kokam'']]. The staple foods are rice and fish. Various kinds of red and green fish, prawns, crab, and shellfish curries (also called ''mashacha sar'' in the Malwani language) are well known, along with ''kombadi'' (chicken) ''wade'' and mutton prepared Malwani style. ''Mohari'' mutton is also one of the distinct delicacies of Malwani cuisine.\n\nA large variety of fish is available in the region, which include ''surmai, karali, bangada, bombil''(Bombay duck), ''paplet'' (pompret), ''halwa, tarali, suandale, kolambi'' (prawns), ''tisari'' (shell fish), ''kalwa'' ([[stone fish]]) and ''kurli'' (crab).\n\nAll these fish are available in dried form, including prawns, which are known as ''sode''. Local curries and ''chatanis'' are also prepared with dried fish.\n\nDifferent types of rice breads and pancakes add to the variety of Malwani cuisine and include ''tandlachi bhakari, ghawane, amboli, patole, appe, tandalachi'' and ''shavai'' (rice noodles). These rice breads can be eaten specially flavored with coconut milk, fish curries, and chicken or mutton curries.\n\n''Sole kadi'' made from ''kokam ''and coconut milk is a signature appetizer drink .\nFor vegetarians, Malwani delicacies include ''alloochi bhaji'', ''alloochi gathaya'', ''kalaya watanyacha'', and ''sambara''(black gram stew).\n\nThe sweets and desserts include ''ukadiche modak'', ''Malawani khaje'', ''khadakahde kundiche ladu'', ''shegdanyache ladu'', ''tandalchi kheer'', and ''tandalachi shavai ani ras'' (specially flavored with coconut milk).\n\n===Manipur===\n{{Main|Manipuri cuisine}}\n[[Manipur]]i cuisine is represented by the cuisine of the [[Meitei people|Meitei]] people who form the majority population in the central plain. Meitei food are simple, tasty, organic and healthy. [[Rice]] with local seasonal vegetables and fish form the main diet. Most of the dishes are cooked like vegetable stew, flavored with either fermented fish called ngari, or dried and smoked fish. The most popular manipuri dish is the [[Eromba]]; it's a preparation of boiled and mashed vegetables, often including [[potatoes]] or [[beans]], mixed with [[Chili pepper|chilli]] and roasted fermented [[fish]]. Another popular dish is the savory cake called Paknam, made of a base of lentil flour stuffed with various ingredients such as banana inflorescence, [[mushrooms]], fish, vegetables etc., and baked covered in [[turmeric]] leaves. Along with spicy dishes, a mild side dish of steamed or boiled sweet vegetables are often served in the daily meals. The manipuri salad dish called singju, made of finely julienned [[cabbage]], green [[papaya]], and other vegetables, and garnished with local herbs, toasted [[sesame]] powder and lentil flour is extremely popular locally, and often found sold in small street side vendors. Singju is often served with bora which are fritters of various kinds, and also kanghou, or oil fried spicy veggies. Cooked and fermented [[soybean]] is a popular condiment in all manipuri kitchens.\nThe staple diet of Manipur consists of [[rice]], [[fish]], large varieties of leafy [[vegetables]] (of both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables in a [[kitchen]] garden and rear fishes in small ponds around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown at home or obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having its own special vegetables and preparations. The taste is very different from mainland Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic [[herbs]] and [[root]]s that are peculiar to the region. They are however very similar to the cuisines of Southeast/East/Central Asia, [[Siberia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]].\n\n===Meghalaya===\n{{Main|Meghalayan cuisine}}\n[[Meghalaya]]n cuisine is unique and different from other Northeastern Indian states.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet blue list: the best in travel 2007\">{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet blue list: the best in travel 2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQASAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 June 2012|date=31 October 2006|publisher=Lonely Planet}}</ref> Spiced meat is common, from goats, pigs, fowl, ducks, chickens, and cows.

Dinner is the simplest meal of the day, typically involving leftovers from either lunch or tiffin.

Food is most often eaten with the hands rather than cutlery. Often ''roti'' is used to scoop curry without allowing it to touch the hand. In the wheat-producing north, a piece of ''roti'' is gripped with the thumb and middle finger and ripped off while holding the ''roti'' down with the index finger. A somewhat different method is used in the south for the dosai, the adai, and the uththappam, where the middle finger is pressed down to hold the crepe down and the forefinger and thumb used to grip and separate a small part. Traditional serving styles vary regionally throughout India.\n\nContact with other cultures has affected Indian dining etiquette. For example, the Anglo-Indian middle class commonly uses spoons and forks, as is traditional in Western culture.<ref name=\"GistWright1973\">{{cite book|author1=Noel Pitts Gist|author2=Roy Dean Wright|title=Marginality and Identity: Anglo-Indians as a Racially-mixed Minority in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-gUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA139|accessdate=28 June 2012|year=1973|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-03638-3|pages=139\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn South India, cleaned banana leaves, which can be disposed of after meals, are used for serving food.

New residents and industry settled here.

McAlpin, James Netherland, Ophelia Byrd, Mack C Atwood, W.L. Maddox, and Bobby Joe Davis. With the Mississippi Supreme Court ruling of June 5, 1973, the incorporation could proceed. A week later, the state legislature issued a charter.

the {{convert|56|mi|km|0}} from Baie-Saint-Paul to [[Quebec City]] on [[stilts]].

Lalibert\u00e9 spent the following winter in Hawaii while Ste-Croix stayed in Quebec to set up a nonprofit [[holding company]] named \"The High-Heeled Club\" (''Club des Talons Hauts)'' to mitigate the losses of the previous summer. This allowed ''Les \u00c9chassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul'' to break even by fall 1981. The following summer, Lalibert\u00e9 and Ste-Croix founded ''La F\u00eate Foraine'', a street performance festival that featured circus performances and workshops to teach the circus arts to the public.<ref name=\"Hermann\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/laliberte-guy-biography|title=Lalibert\u00e9, Guy|author=Hermann|first=Eve M.

In 1983, the government of Quebec gave him a $1.6&nbsp;million grant to host a production the following year as part of Quebec's 450th anniversary celebration of the French explorer [[Jaques Cartier|Jacques Cartier's]] discovery of Canada. This became Cirque du Soleil's first production ''Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil''.<ref name=\"CdS1\" /><ref name=\"Kaya Morgan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.islandconnections.com/edit/guy_laliberte.htm|author=Morgan, Kaya|title=Billionaire Head of the World's Fastest Growing Circus|accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== 1984\u20131989: Early productions ===\nThe company's first production ''Le Grand Tour'' performed in Quebec for 13 weeks in summer 1984. Although several issues persisted during the first tour (including a collapsed tent and conflict between artists), it was a financial success. After securing funding from the [[Canadian government]] for a second year from the help of Quebec premier [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]], Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron, head of the [[\u00c9cole nationale de cirque|National Circus School]], as Cirque du Soleil's [[artistic director]]. Lalibert\u00e9 and Caron reworked the company's performance style to emulate that of [[Moscow State Circus|Moscow Circus]] by having   the acts tell a story. Further influences from the Circus of China, Cirque Arlette Gruss, and [[Circus Roncalli]] led Cirque du Soleil to approach their shows in a more theatrical fashion with live music and no technical crew on stage. To assist in this shift towards a theatrical production, Lalibert\u00e9 and Caron hired Belgian director [[Franco Dragone]] to direct segments of their 1985 production, ''Cirque du Soleil''.<ref name=\"CdS1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soa.ilstu.edu/anthropology/theses/rushing/Thesis.htm|title=Thinking Outside the Big Top: Transformations of Ritual and Culture in the American Circus|author=Rushing, Kelly|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103030417/http://www.soa.ilstu.edu/anthropology/theses/rushing/Thesis.htm|archivedate=3 November 2007|accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe company's first non-Quebec performances in [[Ontario]] in 1985 were unsuccessful, leading to a $750,000 deficit. To allow a 1986 tour to mount, the [[Desjardins Group]] covered $200,000 of bad checks, financier [[Daniel Lamarre]] represented the company for free, and the Quebec government allotted it an additional year of funding. ''La Magie Continue'', their 1986 production, proved more artistically successful with the direction of Franco Dragone. This extended to the creation of their 1987 show ''Le Cirque R\u00e9invent\u00e9''.<ref name=\"CdS1\" />\n\nIn the summer of 1987, Cirque du Soleil was invited to present ''Le Cirque R\u00e9invent\u00e9'' at the Los Angeles Arts Festival.

the {{convert|56|mi|km|0}} from Baie-Saint-Paul to [[Quebec City]] on [[stilts]].

Lalibert\u00e9 spent the following winter in Hawaii while Ste-Croix stayed in Quebec to set up a nonprofit [[holding company]] named \"The High-Heeled Club\" (''Club des Talons Hauts)'' to mitigate the losses of the previous summer. This allowed ''Les \u00c9chassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul'' to break even by fall 1981. The following summer, Lalibert\u00e9 and Ste-Croix founded ''La F\u00eate Foraine'', a street performance festival that featured circus performances and workshops to teach the circus arts to the public.<ref name=\"Hermann\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/laliberte-guy-biography|title=Lalibert\u00e9, Guy|author=Hermann|first=Eve M.

In 1983, the government of Quebec gave him a $1.6&nbsp;million grant to host a production the following year as part of Quebec's 450th anniversary celebration of the French explorer [[Jaques Cartier|Jacques Cartier's]] discovery of Canada. This became Cirque du Soleil's first production ''Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil''.<ref name=\"CdS1\" /><ref name=\"Kaya Morgan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.islandconnections.com/edit/guy_laliberte.htm|author=Morgan, Kaya|title=Billionaire Head of the World's Fastest Growing Circus|accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== 1984\u20131989: Early productions ===\nThe company's first production ''Le Grand Tour'' performed in Quebec for 13 weeks in summer 1984. Although several issues persisted during the first tour (including a collapsed tent and conflict between artists), it was a financial success. After securing funding from the [[Canadian government]] for a second year from the help of Quebec premier [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]], Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron, head of the [[\u00c9cole nationale de cirque|National Circus School]], as Cirque du Soleil's [[artistic director]]. Lalibert\u00e9 and Caron reworked the company's performance style to emulate that of [[Moscow State Circus|Moscow Circus]] by having   the acts tell a story. Further influences from the Circus of China, Cirque Arlette Gruss, and [[Circus Roncalli]] led Cirque du Soleil to approach their shows in a more theatrical fashion with live music and no technical crew on stage. To assist in this shift towards a theatrical production, Lalibert\u00e9 and Caron hired Belgian director [[Franco Dragone]] to direct segments of their 1985 production, ''Cirque du Soleil''.<ref name=\"CdS1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soa.ilstu.edu/anthropology/theses/rushing/Thesis.htm|title=Thinking Outside the Big Top: Transformations of Ritual and Culture in the American Circus|author=Rushing, Kelly|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103030417/http://www.soa.ilstu.edu/anthropology/theses/rushing/Thesis.htm|archivedate=3 November 2007|accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe company's first non-Quebec performances in [[Ontario]] in 1985 were unsuccessful, leading to a $750,000 deficit. To allow a 1986 tour to mount, the [[Desjardins Group]] covered $200,000 of bad checks, financier [[Daniel Lamarre]] represented the company for free, and the Quebec government allotted it an additional year of funding. ''La Magie Continue'', their 1986 production, proved more artistically successful with the direction of Franco Dragone. This extended to the creation of their 1987 show ''Le Cirque R\u00e9invent\u00e9''.<ref name=\"CdS1\" />\n\nIn the summer of 1987, Cirque du Soleil was invited to present ''Le Cirque R\u00e9invent\u00e9'' at the Los Angeles Arts Festival.
