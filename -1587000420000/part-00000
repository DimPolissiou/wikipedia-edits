It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.\n\nApart from its widespread usage, the Br\u00e9guet 14 is known for being the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of metal, rather than wood, in its structure. This allowed the [[airframe]] to be lighter than a wooden airframe of the same strength, in turn making the aircraft relatively fast and agile for its size; in combat it was able to outrun many contemporary [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The Br\u00e9guet 14's strong construction allowed it to sustain considerable damage, in addition to being easy to handle and possessing favourable performance. The type has often been considered to have been one of the best aircraft of the war.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Louis Br\u00e9guet]].<ref name = \"bru noe 3\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 3.</ref> Br\u00e9guet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and advanced aerodynamic test apparatus, including the [[Br\u00e9guet-Richet Gyroplane]], which held the distinction of being the first direct-lift aircraft in the world. Br\u00e9guet had been a pioneer in the field of all-metal construction, which he had employed on a successful series of [[biplane]]s during the pre-war years; these principles were used in the design of the Br\u00e9guet 14.<ref name = \"bru noe 3 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 quickly led to large numbers of Br\u00e9guet-built aircraft being inducted into the military air services of several nations, including many of the nations in the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Br\u00e9guet flew as a military pilot early on in the war and soon recognised there was demand for aircraft fitted with more powerful engines to carry worthwhile payloads over anything beyond short distances. For his next design, he opted to abandon his favoured [[tractor configuration]] in favour of a [[pusher configuration]] to better satisfy the inflexible requirements issued by the French general staff, which sought an unobstructed frontal view to benefit the observer.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1915, the French Ministry of War held a competition, seeking to determine the most suitable type of aircraft to carry a bombload of 300 lb at a speed of 120 km/h over a minimum distance of 600 km.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Following an extensive evaluation, Br\u00e9guet's submission to the contest, [[Br\u00e9guet Bre.4|SN-3]]; reportedly, a major reason for its selection over more powerful rivals was its use of the desired pusher configuration. The SN-3 would be developed into the [[Br\u00e9guet Type IV]], V, and VI, which would be built in large quantities for military use.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nIn spite of the preference of French officials for the pusher configuration, Br\u00e9guet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 4 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> During June 1916, he decided to initiate work on a new design for a military two-seater aircraft, the Br\u00e9guet AV Type XIV. According to aviation authors J. M. Bruce and Jean Noel, the [[French Army]]'s ''Section Technique de l' A\u00e9ronautique'' (S.T.A\u00e9.) received early information on the design and recommended that Br\u00e9guet power it using a 200 hp engine by [[Hispano-Suiza]].<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> Br\u00e9guet found that the engine would be incapable of delivering the desired performance, instead insisting on the adoption of a 12-cylinder [[Renault]]-built engine that had powered the previous Br\u00e9guet Type V.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet Type XIV was both a practical and aesthetically pleasing design.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> A distinctive characteristic of the Type XIV was its rectangular frontal radiator, as well as the shape of is cowling and the negative-stagger of its mainplanes.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> It possessed a sturdy [[landing gear|undercarriage]], along with two-part [[aileron]]s on the upper wing only. On the prototype, the lower wing reportedly featured [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] along the [[trailing edge]]s, that partly emulated the manner of operation of [[Aileron#Single acting ailerons|\"single-acting ailerons\"]] in only \"coming up\" from their \"down\" position at rest, as the aircraft accelerated during takeoff; these possessed a limited angle of depression and were not directly controlled by the pilot, instead being actuated by a set of 12 adjustable [[rubber]] [[bungee cord|bungee]] cords.<ref name = \"bru noe 5 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe airframe was composed primarily of [[duralumin]], invented in Germany by [[Alfred Wilm]] a decade earlier; many sections, such as the duralumin [[longeron]]s and spacers, were attached using [[welding|welded]] [[steel]]-tube fittings and braced using [[piano]] wire. The wing's main [[spar (aeronautics)|spar]] was of rectangular duralumin tubes complete with either [[oak]] or [[ash]] lining-pieces at the attachment points and sheet steel sheaths around the spars.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> The box-unit wooden [[rib]]s had fretted [[plywood]] webs and ash flanges. The surfaces of the tail unit used welded steel tube structures; while the elevators featured horn balances.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> During its design phase, French officials were wary of the Type XIV's structure, having made such an extensive use of the relatively new metal duralumin that it was claimed to be the first aircraft in the world to combine extensive use of the metal with oxy-welded joints.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Into flight===\nOn 21 November 1916, the first [[prototype]] conducted its [[maiden flight]], flown by Br\u00e9guet.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 6.</ref> The first flight had confirmed Br\u00e9guet's opinion that the Renault engine was more suitable for the type; on 30 November 1916, he informed the S.T.A\u00e9 of this determination and of the comparably worse performance of their recommended engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 11 January 1917, Br\u00e9guet informed the S.T.A\u00e9 that the prototype had reached the point where he considered it to be representative of production-standard aircraft. Later that month, it participated in further trials and by 7 February 1917, the S.T.A\u00e9 had issued a report declaring that the prototype had attained an air speed of 172 km/h at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\nDuring November 1916, the S.T.A\u00e9. had issued its requirements for four new aircraft types. Br\u00e9guet submitted his new design for two of those categories - [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[medium bomber|bomber]]. Following its evaluation during February 1917, the Br\u00e9guet 14 had been accepted to perform both roles. On 22 February 1917, Br\u00e9guet pressed the S.T.A\u00e9 for a production order to be issued for the type; on 2 March, he declared that production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] had been prepared for quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Br\u00e9guet, calling for 150  ''Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2''; a follow-on order for a further 100 aircraft was received on 4 April.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Mass production and further development===\nBy March 1917, several orders had been placed, calling for a combined 150 reconnaissance aircraft and 100 bombers \"Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2\" and \"14 B.2\" respectively (in 1918, it was written as ''Br\u00e9guet XIV A2/B2''). The A.2 variant was equipped with an array of [[camera]]s, while some were also provisioned with [[radio]]s, while the lower wing of the 14 B.2 was modified to accommodate bomb racks (built by [[Michelin]]), capable of housing up to thirty-two 115 mm bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> To avoid the bomb racks conflicting with operation of the flaps, a small forward extension of the wings was added; another modification was the installation of transparent panels to the sides of the observer's cockpit to aid in the operation of the [[bomb sight]].<ref name = \"bru noe 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1917, French authorities had expressed a high level of confidence in the type in the form of a substantial expansion of the type's production.<ref name = \"bru noe 6 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 25 April, French aviation company [[Darracq]] was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, another 50 were ordered from [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des avions Henri & Maurice Farman]]; on 18 June, [[Paul Schmitt]] was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Br\u00e9guet 14 until 1918.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Following the war, a handful of aircraft were constructed in French military-owned workshops in [[Indo-China]], albeit these are likely to have been reliant on spare parts.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nAs an insurance against engine shortages, alternative engines to use in place of the standard Renault powerplant were fitted on some aircraft, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> An improved model of the standard engine, referred to as the Renault 12Ff, appeared in Summer 1918 and was used on some later-built aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> Another engine adopted was built by French automotive company [[Lorraine-Dietrich]], which was lighter but produced less power than the Renault unit. A number of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[United States|American]] Br\u00e9guet 14s were outfitted with the [[Fiat A.12]] engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 8 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> A number of later-built B2 models were equipped with the U.S.-built [[Liberty engine]]; to distinguish these aircraft, they were denoted as the ''Br\u00e9guet 14 B2 Ls''.<ref name = \"bru noe 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nOther minor variants of the Br\u00e9guet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the 14 B.1 long-range single-seat bomber, the 14 GR.2 long-range reconnaissance, the 14 H [[floatplane]], the 14 S [[air ambulance]] and the 14 Et.2 [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].<ref name = \"bru noe 10\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 10.</ref> Later variants, such as the 14bis A2 and 14bis B2, featured improved wings. An improved variant equipped with enlarged wings was produced as the [[Br\u00e9guet 16|16]]. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the two-seat fighter [[Br\u00e9guet 17|17]], which would only be built in small numbers due to its late arrival.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 8.</ref> Production of the base Br\u00e9guet 14 continued long after the end of the war, finally ending in 1926.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Breguet 14 - Front.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14 at the Air Service, United States Army Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, France, 1918]]\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was taken on in quantity by the French Air Force. At its peak, the type equipped at least 71 escadrilles of the service, and was deployed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> For its actions during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]], the ''Section Artillerie Lourde'', equipped with the type, received a [[citation]] and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German [[Spring Offensive]]. Om 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie flying the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Many 14A2 and 14B2s were used in the conflict and were subject to considerable modification, particularly to respond to increasing German opposition to Allied Air operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 7 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFollowing its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was also ordered in quantity by the [[Belgian Army]] (40 aircraft) and the [[United States Army Air Service]] (over 600 aircraft).<ref name = \"bru noe 10 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with [[Fiat A.12]] engines due to shortages of the original [[Renault 12F]]. Prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the Br\u00e9guet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type had reportedly been responsible for dropping a combined total of 1,887,600 kg (or 1,854 tons) of bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn one of its more atypical deployments, a Br\u00e9guet 14 played a role in one of the last actions of the war. During November 1918, the aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from [[Tergnier]] and [[Spa]]; it was covered in larger white flags of truce to avoid being engaged.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\"/>\n\nThe type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/> A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated \"14 TOE\" (''Th\u00e9atres des Operations Ext\u00e9rieures''). These saw service in putting down uprisings in [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]], in [[Vietnam]] and in the French intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.\n\nOther air arms using the type included [[Brazilian Air Force|Brazil]] (30), [[Republic of China Air Force|China]] (70), [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovakia]] (10), [[Danish Air Force|Denmark]], [[Finnish Air Force|Finland]] (38), [[Greek Air Force|Greece]], [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japan]], the [[Thailand|Siamese Air Force]], Uruguay (9) and [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]]. The [[Polish Air Force]] used 158 Br\u00e9guet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. In Japan, Br\u00e9guet 14s were licence-built by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nWeeks after the signing of the Armistic, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was used to conduct several long distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> On 26 January 1919, a double-crossing of the [[Mediterranean]] was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from [[Lyon]] to [[Rome]] and then to [[Nice]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Br\u00e9guet 14, flying from [[Paris]] to [[Kenitra]], [[Morocco]], a distance of 1,900 km, in 11 hours 15 minutes. Aviation pioneer [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]] had one example of the type converted to conduct experimental [[in-flight refuelling]] operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 13 14\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n[[File:Breguet 14T bis ambulance L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14T bis Sanitaire photo from L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921]]\nDuring the postwar years, Br\u00e9guet decided to commence manufacture of dedicated civil versions of the Br\u00e9guet 14. The 14 T.2 Salon carried two passengers in a specially modified fuselage. An improved version of this was the 14 Tbis, manufactured as both a land-plane and [[seaplane]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200780.html \"1921 Paris Air Salon: Br\u00e9guet 14Tbis.\"] ''Flight'', 24 November 1921.</ref> The 14 Tbis also formed the basis of the improved 14 Tbis Sanitaire air ambulance version, and 100 [[mail plane]]s custom-built for Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re's fledgling airline, [[Lignes Aeriennes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 13.</ref> After changing its name to \"CGEA\", the airline used, among others, 106 Br\u00e9guet 14s for flights over the [[Sahara]] Desert. The 18 T was a single 14 T re-engined with a [[Renault J]]a engine and equipped to carry four passengers.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> When production finally ceased in 1928, the total of all versions built had reached 7,800 (according to other sources, 8,000 or even 8,370).\n\n==Variants==\nData from:<ref name=\"Davilla\">{{cite book |last1=Davilla |first1=Dr. James J. |last2=Soltan |first2=Arthur M. |title=French aircraft of the First World War |publisher=Flying Machines Press |isbn=1891268090 |pages=101\u2013126}}</ref>\n;Br\u00e9guet AV 1:(Given the STAe designation '''Br\u00e9guet 13''') Company designation of the first aircraft of the Br\u00e9guet 13/14 family.

It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.\n\nApart from its widespread usage, the Br\u00e9guet 14 is known for being the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of metal, rather than wood, in its structure. This allowed the [[airframe]] to be lighter than a wooden airframe of the same strength, in turn making the aircraft relatively fast and agile for its size; in combat it was able to outrun many contemporary [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The Br\u00e9guet 14's strong construction allowed it to sustain considerable damage, in addition to being easy to handle and possessing favourable performance. The type has often been considered to have been one of the best aircraft of the war.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Louis Br\u00e9guet]].<ref name = \"bru noe 3\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 3.</ref> Br\u00e9guet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and advanced aerodynamic test apparatus, including the [[Br\u00e9guet-Richet Gyroplane]], which held the distinction of being the first direct-lift aircraft in the world. Br\u00e9guet had been a pioneer in the field of all-metal construction, which he had employed on a successful series of [[biplane]]s during the pre-war years; these principles were used in the design of the Br\u00e9guet 14.<ref name = \"bru noe 3 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 quickly led to large numbers of Br\u00e9guet-built aircraft being inducted into the military air services of several nations, including many of the nations in the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Br\u00e9guet flew as a military pilot early on in the war and soon recognised there was demand for aircraft fitted with more powerful engines to carry worthwhile payloads over anything beyond short distances. For his next design, he opted to abandon his favoured [[tractor configuration]] in favour of a [[pusher configuration]] to better satisfy the inflexible requirements issued by the French general staff, which sought an unobstructed frontal view to benefit the observer.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1915, the French Ministry of War held a competition, seeking to determine the most suitable type of aircraft to carry a bombload of 300 lb at a speed of 120 km/h over a minimum distance of 600 km.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/> Following an extensive evaluation, Br\u00e9guet's submission to the contest, [[Br\u00e9guet Bre.4|SN-3]]; reportedly, a major reason for its selection over more powerful rivals was its use of the desired pusher configuration. The SN-3 would be developed into the [[Br\u00e9guet Type IV]], V, and VI, which would be built in large quantities for military use.<ref name = \"bru noe 4\"/>\n\n===Origins===\nIn spite of the preference of French officials for the pusher configuration, Br\u00e9guet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 4 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> During June 1916, he decided to initiate work on a new design for a military two-seater aircraft, the Br\u00e9guet AV Type XIV. According to aviation authors J. M. Bruce and Jean Noel, the [[French Army]]'s ''Section Technique de l' A\u00e9ronautique'' (S.T.A\u00e9.) received early information on the design and recommended that Br\u00e9guet power it using a 200 hp engine by [[Hispano-Suiza]].<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> Br\u00e9guet found that the engine would be incapable of delivering the desired performance, instead insisting on the adoption of a 12-cylinder [[Renault]]-built engine that had powered the previous Br\u00e9guet Type V.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet Type XIV was both a practical and aesthetically pleasing design.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> A distinctive characteristic of the Type XIV was its rectangular frontal radiator, as well as the shape of is cowling and the negative-stagger of its mainplanes.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> It possessed a sturdy [[landing gear|undercarriage]], along with two-part [[aileron]]s on the upper wing only. On the prototype, the lower wing reportedly featured [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] along the [[trailing edge]]s, that partly emulated the manner of operation of [[Aileron#Single acting ailerons|\"single-acting ailerons\"]] in only \"coming up\" from their \"down\" position at rest, as the aircraft accelerated during takeoff; these possessed a limited angle of depression and were not directly controlled by the pilot, instead being actuated by a set of 12 adjustable [[rubber]] [[bungee cord|bungee]] cords.<ref name = \"bru noe 5 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe airframe was composed primarily of [[duralumin]], invented in Germany by [[Alfred Wilm]] a decade earlier; many sections, such as the duralumin [[longeron]]s and spacers, were attached using [[welding|welded]] [[steel]]-tube fittings and braced using [[piano]] wire. The wing's main [[spar (aeronautics)|spar]] was of rectangular duralumin tubes complete with either [[oak]] or [[ash]] lining-pieces at the attachment points and sheet steel sheaths around the spars.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> The box-unit wooden [[rib]]s had fretted [[plywood]] webs and ash flanges. The surfaces of the tail unit used welded steel tube structures; while the elevators featured horn balances.<ref name = \"bru noe 5\"/> During its design phase, French officials were wary of the Type XIV's structure, having made such an extensive use of the relatively new metal duralumin that it was claimed to be the first aircraft in the world to combine extensive use of the metal with oxy-welded joints.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Into flight===\nOn 21 November 1916, the first [[prototype]] conducted its [[maiden flight]], flown by Br\u00e9guet.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 6.</ref> The first flight had confirmed Br\u00e9guet's opinion that the Renault engine was more suitable for the type; on 30 November 1916, he informed the S.T.A\u00e9 of this determination and of the comparably worse performance of their recommended engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 11 January 1917, Br\u00e9guet informed the S.T.A\u00e9 that the prototype had reached the point where he considered it to be representative of production-standard aircraft. Later that month, it participated in further trials and by 7 February 1917, the S.T.A\u00e9 had issued a report declaring that the prototype had attained an air speed of 172 km/h at an altitude of 2,000 meters.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\nDuring November 1916, the S.T.A\u00e9. had issued its requirements for four new aircraft types. Br\u00e9guet submitted his new design for two of those categories - [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[medium bomber|bomber]]. Following its evaluation during February 1917, the Br\u00e9guet 14 had been accepted to perform both roles. On 22 February 1917, Br\u00e9guet pressed the S.T.A\u00e9 for a production order to be issued for the type; on 2 March, he declared that production [[jig (tool)|jigs]] had been prepared for quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Br\u00e9guet, calling for 150  ''Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2''; a follow-on order for a further 100 aircraft was received on 4 April.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/>\n\n===Mass production and further development===\nBy March 1917, several orders had been placed, calling for a combined 150 reconnaissance aircraft and 100 bombers \"Br\u00e9guet 14 A.2\" and \"14 B.2\" respectively (in 1918, it was written as ''Br\u00e9guet XIV A2/B2''). The A.2 variant was equipped with an array of [[camera]]s, while some were also provisioned with [[radio]]s, while the lower wing of the 14 B.2 was modified to accommodate bomb racks (built by [[Michelin]]), capable of housing up to thirty-two 115 mm bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> To avoid the bomb racks conflicting with operation of the flaps, a small forward extension of the wings was added; another modification was the installation of transparent panels to the sides of the observer's cockpit to aid in the operation of the [[bomb sight]].<ref name = \"bru noe 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1917, French authorities had expressed a high level of confidence in the type in the form of a substantial expansion of the type's production.<ref name = \"bru noe 6 7\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> On 25 April, French aviation company [[Darracq]] was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, another 50 were ordered from [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des avions Henri & Maurice Farman]]; on 18 June, [[Paul Schmitt]] was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 6\"/> Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Br\u00e9guet 14 until 1918.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Following the war, a handful of aircraft were constructed in French military-owned workshops in [[Indo-China]], albeit these are likely to have been reliant on spare parts.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nAs an insurance against engine shortages, alternative engines to use in place of the standard Renault powerplant were fitted on some aircraft, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> An improved model of the standard engine, referred to as the Renault 12Ff, appeared in Summer 1918 and was used on some later-built aircraft.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\"/> Another engine adopted was built by French automotive company [[Lorraine-Dietrich]], which was lighter but produced less power than the Renault unit. A number of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[United States|American]] Br\u00e9guet 14s were outfitted with the [[Fiat A.12]] engine.<ref name = \"bru noe 8 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> A number of later-built B2 models were equipped with the U.S.-built [[Liberty engine]]; to distinguish these aircraft, they were denoted as the ''Br\u00e9guet 14 B2 Ls''.<ref name = \"bru noe 9\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nOther minor variants of the Br\u00e9guet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the 14 B.1 long-range single-seat bomber, the 14 GR.2 long-range reconnaissance, the 14 H [[floatplane]], the 14 S [[air ambulance]] and the 14 Et.2 [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].<ref name = \"bru noe 10\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 10.</ref> Later variants, such as the 14bis A2 and 14bis B2, featured improved wings. An improved variant equipped with enlarged wings was produced as the [[Br\u00e9guet 16|16]]. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the two-seat fighter [[Br\u00e9guet 17|17]], which would only be built in small numbers due to its late arrival.<ref name = \"bru noe 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 8.</ref> Production of the base Br\u00e9guet 14 continued long after the end of the war, finally ending in 1926.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Breguet 14 - Front.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14 at the Air Service, United States Army Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, France, 1918]]\nThe Br\u00e9guet 14 was taken on in quantity by the French Air Force. At its peak, the type equipped at least 71 escadrilles of the service, and was deployed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> For its actions during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]], the ''Section Artillerie Lourde'', equipped with the type, received a [[citation]] and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German [[Spring Offensive]]. Om 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie flying the type.<ref name = \"bru noe 7\"/> Many 14A2 and 14B2s were used in the conflict and were subject to considerable modification, particularly to respond to increasing German opposition to Allied Air operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 7 8\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFollowing its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was also ordered in quantity by the [[Belgian Army]] (40 aircraft) and the [[United States Army Air Service]] (over 600 aircraft).<ref name = \"bru noe 10 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with [[Fiat A.12]] engines due to shortages of the original [[Renault 12F]]. Prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the Br\u00e9guet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type had reportedly been responsible for dropping a combined total of 1,887,600 kg (or 1,854 tons) of bombs.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn one of its more atypical deployments, a Br\u00e9guet 14 played a role in one of the last actions of the war. During November 1918, the aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from [[Tergnier]] and [[Spa]]; it was covered in larger white flags of truce to avoid being engaged.<ref name = \"bru noe 11\"/>\n\nThe type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/> A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated \"14 TOE\" (''Th\u00e9atres des Operations Ext\u00e9rieures''). These saw service in putting down uprisings in [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]], in [[Vietnam]] and in the French intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.\n\nOther air arms using the type included [[Brazilian Air Force|Brazil]] (30), [[Republic of China Air Force|China]] (70), [[Czech Air Force|Czechoslovakia]] (10), [[Danish Air Force|Denmark]], [[Finnish Air Force|Finland]] (38), [[Greek Air Force|Greece]], [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japan]], the [[Thailand|Siamese Air Force]], Uruguay (9) and [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]]. The [[Polish Air Force]] used 158 Br\u00e9guet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. In Japan, Br\u00e9guet 14s were licence-built by [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name = \"bru noe 12\"/>\n\nWeeks after the signing of the Armistic, the Br\u00e9guet 14 was used to conduct several long distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> On 26 January 1919, a double-crossing of the [[Mediterranean]] was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from [[Lyon]] to [[Rome]] and then to [[Nice]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Br\u00e9guet 14, flying from [[Paris]] to [[Kenitra]], [[Morocco]], a distance of 1,900 km, in 11 hours 15 minutes. Aviation pioneer [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]] had one example of the type converted to conduct experimental [[in-flight refuelling]] operations.<ref name = \"bru noe 13 14\">Bruce and Noel 1967, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n[[File:Breguet 14T bis ambulance L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921.jpg|thumb|Br\u00e9guet 14T bis Sanitaire photo from L'A\u00e9ronautique October 1921]]\nDuring the postwar years, Br\u00e9guet decided to commence manufacture of dedicated civil versions of the Br\u00e9guet 14. The 14 T.2 Salon carried two passengers in a specially modified fuselage. An improved version of this was the 14 Tbis, manufactured as both a land-plane and [[seaplane]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200780.html \"1921 Paris Air Salon: Br\u00e9guet 14Tbis.\"] ''Flight'', 24 November 1921.</ref> The 14 Tbis also formed the basis of the improved 14 Tbis Sanitaire air ambulance version, and 100 [[mail plane]]s custom-built for Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re's fledgling airline, [[Lignes Aeriennes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]].<ref name = \"bru noe 13\">Bruce and Noel 1967, p. 13.</ref> After changing its name to \"CGEA\", the airline used, among others, 106 Br\u00e9guet 14s for flights over the [[Sahara]] Desert. The 18 T was a single 14 T re-engined with a [[Renault J]]a engine and equipped to carry four passengers.<ref name = \"bru noe 13\"/> When production finally ceased in 1928, the total of all versions built had reached 7,800 (according to other sources, 8,000 or even 8,370).\n\n==Variants==\nData from:<ref name=\"Davilla\">{{cite book |last1=Davilla |first1=Dr. James J. |last2=Soltan |first2=Arthur M. |title=French aircraft of the First World War |publisher=Flying Machines Press |isbn=1891268090 |pages=101\u2013126}}</ref>\n;Br\u00e9guet AV 1:(Given the STAe designation '''Br\u00e9guet 13''') Company designation of the first aircraft of the Br\u00e9guet 13/14 family.

Portions of the text are copied onto one of his 1950 sketches.<ref name=\"Sumner Stone Typographics Conference\" />]]\nInterested in calligraphy and the history of Italian printing and lettering, Zapf first visited Italy in 1950. While in Florence, Zapf was particularly interested in the design of the lettering in tombstones of the cemetery of the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica di Santa Croce]] in [[Florence]], in which the strokes subtly widen as they reach stroke terminals without ending in a serif. He quickly sketched an early draft of the design on a 1000 lira banknote.<ref name=\"Sumner Stone Typographics Conference\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Sumner |title=Hermann Zapf |url=http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/ |publisher=Typographics Conference |accessdate=22 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213844/http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/ |archivedate=28 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015\">{{cite web |last1=Siebert |first1=J\u00fcrgen |title=Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015 |url=https://www.fontshop.com/content/hermann-zapf-1918-2015 |publisher=Fontshop |accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> Zapf was to work on the development of Optima during most of the following decade.<ref name=\"Weichselbaumer2015\">{{cite book |author=Nikolaus Julius Weichselbaumer |title=Der Typograph Hermann Zapf: Eine Werkbiographie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9VaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT173 |date=14 December 2015 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG |isbn=978-3-11-041505-6 |pages=173\u2013190}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''About Alphabets'', Zapf commented that his key aim in designing Optima's capitals, inspired by the Roman capital model, was the desire to avoid the monotony of all capital letters having a roughly square footprint, as he felt was true of some [[Sans-serif#Grotesque|early]] sans-serif designs. Like the Roman capitals, Optima's 'E' and 'R' occupy about a half-square, the 'M' is wide and its sides are splayed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Standard] |first1=Hermann Zapf.

Optima is the first German typeface not based on the standard baseline alignment that had been used up until this point in time. Zapf states \u201cThis base line is not ideal for a roman, as it was designed for the high x-height of the Fraktur and Textura letters. Thus, too many German types have ascenders which are too long and descenders which are too short. The proportions of Optima Roman are now in the Golden Section: lowercase x-height equalling the minor and ascenders-descenders the major. However, the curved lines of the stems of each letter result from technical considerations of type manufacturing rather than purely esthetic considerations.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title = Anatomy of a Typeface |last = Lawson |first = Alexander |publisher = David R. Godine |year = 1990 |isbn = 0879233338 |pages = 329\u2013330}}</ref>\n\nThe development of Optima took place over the period 1955-1958. Optima was first manufactured as a foundry version in 1958 by Stempel of Frankfurt, and by Mergenthaler in America shortly thereafter. It was released to the public at an exhibition in D\u00fcsseldorf in that same year. If it had been up to Zapf, Optima would have been named New Roman, but the marketing staff insisted that it be named Optima.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nZapf wrote later in his life of his preference for Optima over all of his other typefaces, but he also mentioned \u201ca father should not have a favorite among his daughters.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Structure==\nOptima\u2019s design follows humanist lines; its capitals (like those of [[Palatino]], Hans Eduard Meier\u2019s [[Syntax (typeface)|Syntax]] and [[Carol Twombly|Carol Twombly's]] [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]]) originate from the classic [[Roman square capitals|Roman monumental capital model]], reflecting a reverence for Roman capitals as an ideal form.\n\nOptima is an example of a modulated-stroke sans-serif, a design type where the strokes are variable in width. The design style has been intermittently popular since the late nineteenth century; Optima is one of the most lastingly popular examples of the genre. Optima was originally targeted by Stempel's Walter Cunz as a competitor to Ludwig & Mayer's Colonia design, which has not been digitised.<ref>{{cite web|title=Optima|url=https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/|publisher=Linotype|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Colonia type specimen\">{{cite web|title=Colonia type specimen|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/winkelhaken/8333977418/|website=Flickr|publisher=Ludwig & Mayer|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> Shaw also suggests the little-known 1948 design Romann Antiqua, as well as Stellar by [[Robert Hunter Middleton]] as predecessors, and notes the existence of Pascal by [[Jos\u00e9 Mendoza y Almeida]] (1962) as a design with a similar set of influences.<ref name=\"About More Alphabets review\" /><ref name=\"Joachim Romann\">{{cite web|title=Joachim Romann|url=http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Romann/JRomann.pdf|publisher=Klingspor Museum|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Pascal ND\">{{cite web|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jos\u00e9|title=Pascal ND|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/pascal-nd/|publisher=Neufville|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=Stellar>{{cite web|title=Stellar|url=http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/stellar|website=Fonts.com|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Stellar Speice\">{{cite web|last1=Speice|first1=Jim|title=Stellar|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/stellar-classic-sg/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Speice Graphics|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref> Optima is however quite restrained in stroke width variation; more display-oriented predecessors such as [[Britannic (typeface)|Britannic]] show far more differentiation in stroke width than Optima does.\n\nOptima's sloped version was originally an [[Oblique type|oblique]] or sloped roman, in which the letters do not take on handwriting characteristics. For Optima nova (discussed below) Zapf decided to create a new [[Italic type|true italic]] with a greater slant angle.\n\nAt the same time as the late development of Optima, Zapf was also working on a non-modulated sans for Linotype, to be named Magnus and intended to compete with [[Gill Sans]]. It was ultimately never released.\n\n==Optima Greek (1973)==\nIt is a Greek variant designed by [[Matthew Carter]], based on sketches from Hermann Zapf.<ref>[http://storage.svettisku.cz/TYPO_2005_18.pdf magazine TYPO.18 December 2005 issue]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319104747/http://storage.svettisku.cz/TYPO_2005_18.pdf |date=March 19, 2009 }}</ref> Digital version has not been produced.\n\n==Optima Classified (1976)==\nIt is a variant designed by [[Matthew Carter]], based closely on Optima Medium. No digital versions have been produced.\n\n==Optima nova (2002)==\n[[File:Optima nova specimen.svg|thumb|A specimen image of Optima Nova showing its italic, stylistic alternates and condensed weights]]\nOptima nova is a redesign of the original font family, designed by Hermann Zapf and [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] GmbH type director Akira Kobayashi.<ref name=\"Berry\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=John D.|title=Optima nova \u2014 A New Take on Timeless Face|url=http://creativepro.com/dot-font-optima-nova-new-take-on-timeless-face/|website=Creative Pro|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Optima nova issuu\">{{cite web|title=Optima nova|url=https://issuu.com/Linotype/docs/optima_nova_brochure|website=issuu|publisher=Linotype}}</ref> The new family contains seven font weights, adding light, demi, and heavy font weights, but removing extra black weight. Medium weight is readjusted to between medium and bold weights in the old family scale. Glyph sets are expanded to include Adobe CE and Latin Extended characters, with light to bold weight fonts supporting proportional lining figures, old style figures, and small caps.\n\nThe initial and most common release of Optima, like many sans-serif fonts, has an [[oblique type|oblique]] style instead of an [[italic type|italic]]: the shapes are merely tilted to the right. In Optima nova, this is replaced by a true italic. (In interviews, Zapf has said that this was his original goal from the beginning, but the need to release Optima quickly forced him to settle for an oblique.)\n\nEven in Roman fonts, letters such as Q, a, f are redesigned. The overall bounding boxes were widened in Optima nova.\n\nReviewing it, John Berry wrote that \"its [[Type color|'color']] on the page comes much closer to that of the original metal version than any of the earlier photo/digital versions did\" but that \"ends of the strokes in the letters 'a', 'c', and 's' flare much more dramatically than they ever did in the older Optima \u2014 so much so that these letters almost look as though they have serifs...It\u2019s a subtle difference, but it\u2019s disturbing if you\u2019re used to the understated elegance of Optima\u2019s letterforms.\"<ref name=\"Berry\" />\n\n===Optima nova Condensed===\nIt is a condensed variant which consists of light to bold weights, but no italic fonts. The glyph set does not support proportional lining figures, old style figures, or small caps.\n\n===Optima nova Titling===\nIt is a [[titling capitals]] variant, which contains only capital letters, with restyled letterform. The glyph set is the same as Optima nova Condensed, but also includes extra ligatures. Berry writes in his review of the nova release: \"it has softly curved joins and interior angles. Instead of the added crispness of detail that you might expect of a face designed for display use, this one looks more sculptural.\"<ref name=\"Berry\" />\n\nIn the tradition of hand lettering and lapidary inscription, the titling face shares similarities with the work of Zapf's friend [[Herb Lubalin]], especially the exuberant ligatures (for which Lubalin's ITC Lubalin Graph and ITC Avant Garde are notable). Further influence of [[A.M. Cassandre]] and [[Rudolf Koch]], whose work greatly inspired the young Zapf, can also be seen in Optima.\n\n==Optima Pro Cyrillic (2010)==\nIn April 2010, Linotype announced the release of Cyrillic version of the original Optima family, in OpenType Pro font formats. Released fonts include Optima Pro Cyrillic Roman, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique.<ref>[http://www.linotype.com/en/6276/internationaltypographygetsacyrillicboost.html International typography gets a Cyrillic boost]</ref>\n\n==Derivatives==\nAs with many popular fonts, knockoff designs and re-releases under different names are common, some created by Zapf himself. These all tend to copy the original release, rather than the Optima nova design which represents Zapf's final thoughts on his design. In the [[Bitstream Inc.|Bitstream]] font collection, Zapf Humanist 601 is provided as an Optima clone. Other Optima clones include Optane from the WSI Fonts collection, Opulent by Rubicon Computer Labs Inc., Ottawa from [[Corel]], CG Omega and Eterna. Freely available implementations include URW Classico (available with URW Font package from [[Ghostscript]]). [[Linux Biolinum]] is a libre font inspired by it. Zapf's [[Palatino|Palatino Sans]] is a more informal typeface in the same style, with a design reminiscent of brushstrokes or calligraphy. \n\nKontour Type designed the Utile Display typeface, which based on the Optima typeface.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game, set, match: Utile aces all your type needs|url=https://kontour.typenetwork.com/news/article/game-set-match-utile-aces-all-your-type-needs|website=kontour.typenetwork.com|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn a memoir written for Linotype, Zapf commented: {{quote|The name \"Optima\" was not my idea at all. It is for me too presumptuous and was the invention of the sales people at Stempel.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Margaret Re, Johanna Drucker, Matthew Carter, James Mosley.

Stempel AG foundry, [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and released in 1958.\n\nThough classified as a [[sans-serif]], Optima has a subtle swelling at the terminals suggesting a glyphic serif. Optima was inspired by [[Roman square capitals|classical Roman capitals]] and the stonecarving on [[Renaissance]]-period tombstones Zapf saw in [[Florence]] on a 1950 holiday to Italy.<ref name=\"Optima Monotype\">{{cite web|last1=Haley|first1=Allen|title=Optima|url=http://cdncms.fonts.net/documents/4de43fc877b5c1ce/ILOptimaFIN.pdf|publisher=[[Monotype Imaging]]|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nZapf intended Optima to be a typeface that could serve for both body text and titling. To prove its versatility, Zapf set his entire book ''About Alphabets'' in the regular weight.<ref name=\"About More Alphabets review\">{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=About More Alphabets review|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2012/12/blue-pencil-no-20-zapfiana-no-1-about-more-alphabets/|website=Blue Pencil letter design|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref> Zapf retained an interest in the design, collaborating on variants and expansions into his eighties.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:S. croce, tomba sul pavimento 14 berti.JPG|thumb|Zapf cited this gravestone as inspiring Optima. Portions of the text are copied onto one of his 1950 sketches.<ref name=\"Sumner Stone Typographics Conference\" />]]\nInterested in calligraphy and the history of Italian printing and lettering, Zapf first visited Italy in 1950. While in Florence, Zapf was particularly interested in the design of the lettering in tombstones of the cemetery of the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica di Santa Croce]] in [[Florence]], in which the strokes subtly widen as they reach stroke terminals without ending in a serif. He quickly sketched an early draft of the design on a 1000 lira banknote.<ref name=\"Sumner Stone Typographics Conference\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Sumner |title=Hermann Zapf |url=http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/ |publisher=Typographics Conference |accessdate=22 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213844/http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/ |archivedate=28 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015\">{{cite web |last1=Siebert |first1=J\u00fcrgen |title=Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015 |url=https://www.fontshop.com/content/hermann-zapf-1918-2015 |publisher=Fontshop |accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> Zapf was to work on the development of Optima during most of the following decade.<ref name=\"Weichselbaumer2015\">{{cite book |author=Nikolaus Julius Weichselbaumer |title=Der Typograph Hermann Zapf: Eine Werkbiographie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9VaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT173 |date=14 December 2015 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG |isbn=978-3-11-041505-6 |pages=173\u2013190}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''About Alphabets'', Zapf commented that his key aim in designing Optima's capitals, inspired by the Roman capital model, was the desire to avoid the monotony of all capital letters having a roughly square footprint, as he felt was true of some [[Sans-serif#Grotesque|early]] sans-serif designs. Like the Roman capitals, Optima's 'E' and 'R' occupy about a half-square, the 'M' is wide and its sides are splayed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Standard] |first1=Hermann Zapf.

Optima is the first German typeface not based on the standard baseline alignment that had been used up until this point in time. Zapf states \u201cThis base line is not ideal for a roman, as it was designed for the high x-height of the Fraktur and Textura letters. Thus, too many German types have ascenders which are too long and descenders which are too short. The proportions of Optima Roman are now in the Golden Section: lowercase x-height equalling the minor and ascenders-descenders the major. However, the curved lines of the stems of each letter result from technical considerations of type manufacturing rather than purely esthetic considerations.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title = Anatomy of a Typeface |last = Lawson |first = Alexander |publisher = David R. Godine |year = 1990 |isbn = 0879233338 |pages = 329\u2013330}}</ref>\n\nThe development of Optima took place over the period 1955-1958. Optima was first manufactured as a foundry version in 1958 by Stempel of Frankfurt, and by Mergenthaler in America shortly thereafter. It was released to the public at an exhibition in D\u00fcsseldorf in that same year. If it had been up to Zapf, Optima would have been named New Roman, but the marketing staff insisted that it be named Optima.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nZapf wrote later in his life of his preference for Optima over all of his other typefaces, but he also mentioned \u201ca father should not have a favorite among his daughters.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Structure==\nOptima\u2019s design follows humanist lines; its capitals (like those of [[Palatino]], Hans Eduard Meier\u2019s [[Syntax (typeface)|Syntax]] and [[Carol Twombly|Carol Twombly's]] [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]]) originate from the classic [[Roman square capitals|Roman monumental capital model]], reflecting a reverence for Roman capitals as an ideal form.\n\nOptima is an example of a modulated-stroke sans-serif, a design type where the strokes are variable in width. The design style has been intermittently popular since the late nineteenth century; Optima is one of the most lastingly popular examples of the genre. Optima was originally targeted by Stempel's Walter Cunz as a competitor to Ludwig & Mayer's Colonia design, which has not been digitised.<ref>{{cite web|title=Optima|url=https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/|publisher=Linotype|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Colonia type specimen\">{{cite web|title=Colonia type specimen|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/winkelhaken/8333977418/|website=Flickr|publisher=Ludwig & Mayer|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> Shaw also suggests the little-known 1948 design Romann Antiqua, as well as Stellar by [[Robert Hunter Middleton]] as predecessors, and notes the existence of Pascal by [[Jos\u00e9 Mendoza y Almeida]] (1962) as a design with a similar set of influences.<ref name=\"About More Alphabets review\" /><ref name=\"Joachim Romann\">{{cite web|title=Joachim Romann|url=http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Romann/JRomann.pdf|publisher=Klingspor Museum|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Pascal ND\">{{cite web|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jos\u00e9|title=Pascal ND|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/pascal-nd/|publisher=Neufville|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=Stellar>{{cite web|title=Stellar|url=http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/stellar|website=Fonts.com|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Stellar Speice\">{{cite web|last1=Speice|first1=Jim|title=Stellar|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/stellar-classic-sg/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Speice Graphics|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref> Optima is however quite restrained in stroke width variation; more display-oriented predecessors such as [[Britannic (typeface)|Britannic]] show far more differentiation in stroke width than Optima does.\n\nOptima's sloped version was originally an [[Oblique type|oblique]] or sloped roman, in which the letters do not take on handwriting characteristics. For Optima nova (discussed below) Zapf decided to create a new [[Italic type|true italic]] with a greater slant angle.\n\nAt the same time as the late development of Optima, Zapf was also working on a non-modulated sans for Linotype, to be named Magnus and intended to compete with [[Gill Sans]]. It was ultimately never released.\n\n==Optima Greek (1973)==\nIt is a Greek variant designed by [[Matthew Carter]], based on sketches from Hermann Zapf.<ref>[http://storage.svettisku.cz/TYPO_2005_18.pdf magazine TYPO.18 December 2005 issue]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319104747/http://storage.svettisku.cz/TYPO_2005_18.pdf |date=March 19, 2009 }}</ref> Digital version has not been produced.\n\n==Optima Classified (1976)==\nIt is a variant designed by [[Matthew Carter]], based closely on Optima Medium.

The main effect of stack technology is a form of immortality, because a stack can be installed into another body if the original body dies. But there\u2019s another major implication only hinted at during the first season of ''Altered Carbon'': If you could choose your own body, would you go with the one you were born with? That's an especially important question for gender fluid or transgender people. The topic was only hinted at in the first season, but ''Altered Carbon'' creator Laeta Kalogridis told ''The Wrap'' it's something she would like to explore in greater detail.<ref name=\"Transgenderism\">{{cite web |url=https://thewrap.com/altered-carbon-transgender-stacks-lgbt-laeta-kalogridis/ |title=''Altered Carbon'' Creator on How Show Could Examine LGBTQ Issues in Season 2 |website=The Wrap |first=Jennifer |last=Maas |date=February 13, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n==== Season 1 ====\nOn review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season holds an approval rating of 68% based on 95 reviews, and an average rating of 6.59/10.

Bancroft died just after his consciousness was uploaded and saved to a satellite, and the evidence suggests it was a suicide.

The main effect of stack technology is a form of immortality, because a stack can be installed into another body if the original body dies. But there\u2019s another major implication only hinted at during the first season of ''Altered Carbon'': If you could choose your own body, would you go with the one you were born with? That's an especially important question for gender fluid or transgender people. The topic was only hinted at in the first season, but ''Altered Carbon'' creator Laeta Kalogridis told ''The Wrap'' it's something she would like to explore in greater detail.<ref name=\"Transgenderism\">{{cite web |url=https://thewrap.com/altered-carbon-transgender-stacks-lgbt-laeta-kalogridis/ |title=''Altered Carbon'' Creator on How Show Could Examine LGBTQ Issues in Season 2 |website=The Wrap |first=Jennifer |last=Maas |date=February 13, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n==== Season 1 ====\nOn review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season holds an approval rating of 68% based on 95 reviews, and an average rating of 6.59/10.

In January 1992, Clapton performed the song in front of an audience at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]], Berkshire, England for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', with the recording appearing on his ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]'' album.\n\nThe song was Clapton's best-selling single in the United States and reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In his home country the United Kingdom it reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world. It won three [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Tears in Heaven\" 362nd on its list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\".\n\n==Writing and recording==\nIn August 1990, Clapton's manager, two of his [[Road crew|roadies]] and his friend and fellow musician [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] were killed in a [[Death of Stevie Ray Vaughan|helicopter accident]].

He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting \"Tears in Heaven\" for the soundtrack with [[Will Jennings]]. In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmmBynDJzWw|title=Eric Clapton : Sue Lawley 1992|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Daphne Barak, Clapton said: \"I almost subconsciously used music for myself as a healing agent, and lo and behold, it worked...

He told me that he had admired the work I did with [[Steve Winwood]] and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject. This is a song so personal and so sad that it is unique in my experience of writing songs.{{ref|songfacts}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==Release==\nShortly after the single was released, Clapton recorded the song in front of an audience at [[Bray Studios]], Berkshire, England as part of a set for ''[[MTV Unplugged]],''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/unplugged-r4050|title=MTV Unplugged - Eric Clapton &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]|date=1992-08-18|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref> released as ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]].''

I really have to connect with the feelings that were there when I wrote them. They're kind of gone and I really don't want them to come back, particularly. My life is different now.

In January 1992, Clapton performed the song in front of an audience at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]], Berkshire, England for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', with the recording appearing on his ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]'' album.\n\nThe song was Clapton's best-selling single in the United States and reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In his home country the United Kingdom it reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world.

He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting \"Tears in Heaven\" for the soundtrack with [[Will Jennings]]. In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmmBynDJzWw|title=Eric Clapton : Sue Lawley 1992|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Daphne Barak, Clapton said: \"I almost subconsciously used music for myself as a healing agent, and lo and behold, it worked...

He told me that he had admired the work I did with [[Steve Winwood]] and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject. This is a song so personal and so sad that it is unique in my experience of writing songs.{{ref|songfacts}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==Release==\nShortly after the single was released, Clapton recorded the song in front of an audience at [[Bray Studios]], Berkshire, England as part of a set for ''[[MTV Unplugged]],''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/unplugged-r4050|title=MTV Unplugged - Eric Clapton &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]|date=1992-08-18|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref> released as ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]].''

These murders occurred between August and November 1888 within a short distance of each other, and are collectively known as the \"[[Jack the Ripper#Canonical five|canonical five]]\". The six other murders\u2014those of [[Emma Elizabeth Smith]], [[Martha Tabram]], Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman\u2014have been linked with Jack the Ripper to varying degrees.\n\nThe swiftness of the attacks, and the manner of the mutilations performed on some of the bodies, which included disembowelment and removal of organs, led to speculation that the murderer had the skills of a physician or butcher.<ref>e.g. Dr Winslow, the examining pathologist, quoted in Haggard, Robert F.

Lawton further stated that he believed Feigenbaum was Jack the Ripper. Though covered by the press at the time, the idea was not pursued for more than a century.

Described as violently antisocial, the poor East End local was suggested as a suspect by author and Ripperologist [[Martin Fido]] in his book ''The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper'' (1987). Fido claimed that the name \"David Cohen\" was used at the time to refer to a Jewish immigrant who either could not be positively identified or whose name was too difficult for police to spell, in the same fashion that \"[[John Doe]]\" is used in the United States today.<ref name=\"fido\">Fido quoted in Rumbelow, pp.180\u2013181</ref> Fido identified Cohen with \"Leather Apron\" (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#John Pizer|John Pizer]] above), and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis and who could not be traced after mid-1888\u2014the same time that Cohen appeared.<ref>Fido, pp. 215\u2013219</ref> Fido believed that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#Aaron Kosminski|Aaron Kosminski]] above). Cohen exhibited violent, destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He died at the asylum in October 1889.<ref>Fido, p. 220</ref> In his book ''The Cases That Haunt Us'', former FBI criminal profiler [[John E.

On 12 November 1888, he made a formal statement to the London police that in the early hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was \"of Jewish appearance\", despite the darkness of that night.<ref>Cullen, p. 180; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 190\u2013192; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 376\u2013377; Fido, p. 96; Marriott, p. 263</ref> The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful.<ref>Inspector Abberline's report, 12 November 1888, Metropolitan police archives, MEPO 3/140 ff. 230\u20132, quoted in Begg,''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 238\u2013239 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 377\u2013378</ref> However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness.<ref>Cook, ''Jack the Ripper'', p. 176</ref> Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself,<!--Bob Hinton's \"From Hell...The Jack the Ripper Mystery\" & Stephen Wright's \"Jack the Ripper: An American View\"--> trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.<ref>Marriott, p. 263</ref>\n\n===James Kelly===\n{{Main article|James Kelly (murderer)}}\n[[File:Jkelly.jpg|left|60px|James Kelly]]'''James Kelly''' (20 April 1860 \u2013 17 September 1929) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's ''Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation'' (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in ''Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper'', by Jim Tully, in 1997.<ref>Tully, Jim, '' Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper ''.</ref>\n\nJames Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck. Deemed insane, he was committed to the [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum]], from which he later escaped in early 1888, using a key he fashioned himself. After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior to his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum. He died two years later, presumably of natural causes.\n\nRetired New York Police Department cold-case detective [[Ed Norris]] examined the Jack the Ripper case for a Discovery Channel programme called ''Jack the Ripper in America''. In it, Norris claims that James Kelly was Jack the Ripper, and that he was also responsible for multiple murders in cities around the United States. Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.<ref>''Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer And a Literary Phenomenon'' {{ISBN|0-873-38861-5}} pp. 194-195</ref>\n\n===Charles Allen Lechmere===\n'''Charles Allen Lechmere''' (1849\u20131920), also known as '''Charles Cross''', was a meat cart driver for the Pickfords company, and is conventionally regarded as an innocent witness who discovered the body of [[Mary Ann Nichols|Polly Nichols]]. In a documentary titled ''Jack the Ripper: The New Evidence'', Swedish journalist Christer Holmgren and criminologist Gareth Norris of [[Aberystwyth University]], with assistance from former detective Andy Griffiths, proposed that Lechmere was the Ripper. According to Holmgren, Lechmere lied to police, claiming that he had been with Nichols's body for a few minutes, whereas research on his route to work from his home demonstrated that he must have been with her for about nine minutes.\n\nWhen Lechmere called over Robert Paul to look at her, no blood was visible, but by the time a constable found her shortly afterward, a pool had formed around her neck, suggesting the cut to her throat was very fresh when Lechmere and Paul were present. In addition, neither man reported seeing or hearing anyone else in Buck's Row, which had no side exits. It was theorized that Lechmere had killed Nichols and begun the process of mutilating her body when he heard Paul's footsteps, and then rushed to portray himself as the discoverer of her body. Lechmere did not come forward until Paul mentioned him to the press, and he gave evidence under the name \"Charles Cross\" at the inquest; Cross was the surname of a stepfather.\n\nLechmere's home address, visits to family, and route to work link him to the times and places of murders; he passed three streets where [[Martha Tabram]], Polly Nichols, and Annie Chapman were murdered roughly at the same time the murders are estimated to have occurred. The \"Double Event\" murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes occurred on a Saturday, his only night off from work: Stride was killed near Lechmere's mother's house in an area he grew up in, and the direct route from Stride's murder scene to the location of Eddowes's murder followed a path to Lechmere's route to work that he had used for twenty years. Mary Kelly was also murdered on his route to work, and the time frame in which she is estimated to have been killed matches his route, although the day she was killed was a holiday and he may have had the day off.\n\nLechmere's family background is also similar to that of many serial killers: he grew up in a \"broken home\"; having never known his biological father, he had two stepfathers; and his childhood was characterized by an instability of residence, growing up in a series of different homes. In addition, his occupation as a meat cart driver would have allowed his blood-splattered appearance to escape suspicion. Holmgren believes that Lechmere may have been responsible for several other murders in addition to those of the canonical five victims and Martha Tabram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/conspiracy-the-missing-evidence/episodes/episode-3-616|title=Jack The Ripper: The Missing Evidence|work=Five}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2014/11/title-159995-en.html|title=Aberystwyth University \u2013 November|work=aber.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Connor |first1=Michael |title=Casebook: Jack the Ripper - Charles Cross was Jack the Ripper? |url=https://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rip-charles-cross-was-jtr.html |website=www.casebook.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/535861/How-police-overlooked-the-Ripper|title=EXCLUSIVE: Police overlooked Ripper 'hiding in plain sight'|first=Jaymi|last=McCann|date=16 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Jacob Levy===\n'''Jacob Levy''' (1856 \u2013  29 July 1891) was born in Aldgate in 1856.

Harrison dismissed the idea that Albert Victor was the Ripper but instead suggested that Stephen, a poet and one of Albert Victor's tutors from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], was a more likely suspect. Harrison's suggestion was based on Stephen's misogynistic writings and on similarities between his handwriting and that of the [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\"]] letter, supposedly written by the Ripper. Harrison supposed that Stephen may have had sexual feelings for Albert Victor, and that Stephen's hatred of women arose from jealousy because Albert Victor preferred female company and did not reciprocate Stephen's feelings.<ref>[[Michael Harrison (writer)|Harrison, Michael]] (1972).

Spiering further suggested that Albert Victor died due to an overdose of [[morphine]], administered to him on the order of Prime Minister [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and possibly Albert Victor's own father, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]].

The suggestion was widely dismissed, as Albert Victor had strong alibis for the murders, and it is unlikely that he suffered from syphilis.<ref>e.g. Rumbelow, pp.211\u2013213</ref> Stowell later denied implying that Clarence was the Ripper<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (9&nbsp;November 1970). \"Jack the Ripper\". ''[[The Times]]'' p.9; Issue 58018; col.F</ref> but efforts to investigate his claims further were hampered, as Stowell was elderly, and he died from natural causes just days after the publication of his article. The same week, Stowell's son reported that he had burned his father's papers, saying \"I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance.\"<ref>PHS (14&nbsp;November 1970). \"The Times Diary: Ripper file destroyed\". ''The Times'' p.12; Issue 58023; col.E</ref>\n\nSubsequently, [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]], such as [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] in ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'', have elaborated on the supposed involvement of Clarence in the murders. Rather than implicate Albert Victor directly, they claim that he secretly married and had a daughter with a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] shop assistant, and that Queen Victoria, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], his [[Freemason]] friends, and the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] conspired to murder anyone aware of Albert Victor's supposed child. Many facts contradict this theory and its originator, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax.<ref>''The Sunday Times'', 18&nbsp;June 1978, quoted in Rumbelow, p.237</ref> Variations of the theory involve the physician [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], the artist [[Walter Sickert]], and the poet [[James Kenneth Stephen]] to greater or lesser degrees, and have been fictionalised in novels and films, such as ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]''.\n\n===Joseph Barnett===\n{{Main article|Joseph Barnett (Jack the Ripper suspect)}}\n[[File:Joseph-barnett-jack-the-rip.jpg|left|60px|Joseph Barnett]]'''Joseph Barnett''' (c. 1858\u20131927) was a former fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and separated after he lost his job and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge.<ref name=\"rwr\"/> A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution.<ref name=\"rwr\">Rumbelow, p. 262; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body to make it look like a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 262</ref> Other acquaintances of Kelly put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, p. 123</ref>\n\n===Lewis Carroll===\n[[File:Lewis carroll.jpg|60px|frameless|left|Lewis Caroll]]\n{{Main article|Lewis Carroll}}\t\n'''Lewis Carroll''' ([[pen name]] of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) (27 January 1832 \u2013 14 January 1898) was the author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

Described as violently antisocial, the poor East End local was suggested as a suspect by author and Ripperologist [[Martin Fido]] in his book ''The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper'' (1987). Fido claimed that the name \"David Cohen\" was used at the time to refer to a Jewish immigrant who either could not be positively identified or whose name was too difficult for police to spell, in the same fashion that \"[[John Doe]]\" is used in the United States today.<ref name=\"fido\">Fido quoted in Rumbelow, pp.180\u2013181</ref> Fido identified Cohen with \"Leather Apron\" (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#John Pizer|John Pizer]] above), and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis and who could not be traced after mid-1888\u2014the same time that Cohen appeared.<ref>Fido, pp. 215\u2013219</ref> Fido believed that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion (see [[Jack the Ripper suspects#Aaron Kosminski|Aaron Kosminski]] above). Cohen exhibited violent, destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He died at the asylum in October 1889.<ref>Fido, p. 220</ref> In his book ''The Cases That Haunt Us'', former FBI criminal profiler [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]] has asserted that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person \"known to the police as David Cohen&nbsp;... or someone very much like him\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Douglas, John |author2=Olshaker, Mark |year=2001|title=The Cases That Haunt Us |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|pages=79\u201380|isbn=978-0-7432-1239-7}}</ref>\n\n===William Withey Gull===\n{{Main article|Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet}}\n[[File:Sir William Withey Gull.jpg|left|60px|Sir William Withey Gull]]'''Sir William Withey Gull''' (31 December 1816 \u2013 29 January 1890) was physician-in-ordinary to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. He was named as the Ripper as part of the evolution of the widely discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/royal conspiracy theory outlined in such books as ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]''. Coachman [[John Netley]] has been named as his accomplice. Thanks to the popularity of this theory among fiction writers and for its dramatic nature, Gull shows up as the Ripper in a number of books and films including the TV film ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1988), [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]]'s graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'' (1999), and its [[From Hell (film)|2001 film adaptation]], in which [[Ian Holm]] plays Gull. Conventional historians have never taken Gull seriously as a suspect due to sheer lack of evidence; in addition, he was in his seventies at the time of the murders and had recently suffered a [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Douglas, John |author2=Olshaker, Mark |year=2001|title=The Cases That Haunt Us |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|pages=72\u20134|isbn=978-0-7432-1239-7}}</ref>\n\n===George Hutchinson===\n{{Main article|George Hutchinson (Jack the Ripper suspect)}}\n'''George Hutchinson''' was an unemployed labourer. On 12 November 1888, he made a formal statement to the London police that in the early hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was \"of Jewish appearance\", despite the darkness of that night.<ref>Cullen, p. 180; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 190\u2013192; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 376\u2013377; Fido, p. 96; Marriott, p. 263</ref> The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful.<ref>Inspector Abberline's report, 12 November 1888, Metropolitan police archives, MEPO 3/140 ff. 230\u20132, quoted in Begg,''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 238\u2013239 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 377\u2013378</ref> However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness.<ref>Cook, ''Jack the Ripper'', p. 176</ref> Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself,<!--Bob Hinton's \"From Hell...The Jack the Ripper Mystery\" & Stephen Wright's \"Jack the Ripper: An American View\"--> trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.<ref>Marriott, p. 263</ref>\n\n===James Kelly===\n{{Main article|James Kelly (murderer)}}\n[[File:Jkelly.jpg|left|60px|James Kelly]]'''James Kelly''' (20 April 1860 \u2013 17 September 1929) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's ''Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation'' (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in ''Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper'', by Jim Tully, in 1997.<ref>Tully, Jim, '' Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper ''.</ref>\n\nJames Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck. Deemed insane, he was committed to the [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum]], from which he later escaped in early 1888, using a key he fashioned himself. After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior to his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum. He died two years later, presumably of natural causes.\n\nRetired New York Police Department cold-case detective [[Ed Norris]] examined the Jack the Ripper case for a Discovery Channel programme called ''Jack the Ripper in America''. In it, Norris claims that James Kelly was Jack the Ripper, and that he was also responsible for multiple murders in cities around the United States. Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.<ref>''Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer And a Literary Phenomenon'' {{ISBN|0-873-38861-5}} pp. 194-195</ref>\n\n===Charles Allen Lechmere===\n'''Charles Allen Lechmere''' (1849\u20131920), also known as '''Charles Cross''', was a meat cart driver for the Pickfords company, and is conventionally regarded as an innocent witness who discovered the body of [[Mary Ann Nichols|Polly Nichols]]. In a documentary titled ''Jack the Ripper: The New Evidence'', Swedish journalist Christer Holmgren and criminologist Gareth Norris of [[Aberystwyth University]], with assistance from former detective Andy Griffiths, proposed that Lechmere was the Ripper. According to Holmgren, Lechmere lied to police, claiming that he had been with Nichols's body for a few minutes, whereas research on his route to work from his home demonstrated that he must have been with her for about nine minutes. \n\nWhen Lechmere called over Robert Paul to look at her, no blood was visible, but by the time a constable found her shortly afterward, a pool had formed around her neck, suggesting the cut to her throat was very fresh when Lechmere and Paul were present. In addition, neither man reported seeing or hearing anyone else in Buck's Row, which had no side exits. It was theorized that Lechmere had killed Nichols and begun the process of mutilating her body when he heard Paul's footsteps, and then rushed to portray himself as the discoverer of her body. Lechmere did not come forward until Paul mentioned him to the press, and he gave evidence under the name \"Charles Cross\" at the inquest; Cross was the surname of a stepfather.\n\nLechmere's home address, visits to family, and route to work link him to the times and places of murders; he passed three streets where [[Martha Tabram]], Polly Nichols, and Annie Chapman were murdered roughly at the same time the murders are estimated to have occurred. The \"Double Event\" murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes occurred on a Saturday, his only night off from work: Stride was killed near Lechmere's mother's house in an area he grew up in, and the direct route from Stride's murder scene to the location of Eddowes's murder followed a path to Lechmere's route to work that he had used for twenty years. Mary Kelly was also murdered on his route to work, and the time frame in which she is estimated to have been killed matches his route, although the day she was killed was a holiday and he may have had the day off. \n\nLechmere's family background is also similar to that of many serial killers: he grew up in a \"broken home\"; having never known his biological father, he had two stepfathers; and his childhood was characterized by an instability of residence, growing up in a series of different homes. In addition, his occupation as a meat cart driver would have allowed his blood-splattered appearance to escape suspicion. Holmgren believes that Lechmere may have been responsible for several other murders in addition to those of the canonical five victims and Martha Tabram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/conspiracy-the-missing-evidence/episodes/episode-3-616|title=Jack The Ripper: The Missing Evidence|work=Five}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2014/11/title-159995-en.html|title=Aberystwyth University \u2013 November|work=aber.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Connor |first1=Michael |title=Casebook: Jack the Ripper - Charles Cross was Jack the Ripper? |url=https://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rip-charles-cross-was-jtr.html |website=www.casebook.org |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/535861/How-police-overlooked-the-Ripper|title=EXCLUSIVE: Police overlooked Ripper 'hiding in plain sight'|first=Jaymi|last=McCann|date=16 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Jacob Levy===\n'''Jacob Levy''' (1856 \u2013  29 July 1891) was born in Aldgate in 1856.

A diary purportedly by Maybrick, published in the 1990s by Michael Barrett, contains a confession to the Ripper murders. In 1995, Barrett confessed to writing the diary himself, and described the process of counterfeiting the diary in detail. He swore under oath that he and his wife, Anne, had forged it.<ref>Affidavit of Michael Barrett, 5 January 1995, quoted in Marriott, pp.272\u2013277</ref> Anne Barrett, after their divorce, later denied forgery, and their story changed several times over the years.

Le Queux claimed to have seen a manuscript in French written by [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] stating that Jack the Ripper was an insane Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko, an agent of the [[Okhrana]] (the Secret Police of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]), whose aim in committing the murders was to discredit Scotland Yard. He was supposedly assisted by two accomplices: \"Levitski\" and a tailoress called Winberg.<ref>Le Queux, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 197 and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 103</ref> However, there is no hard evidence that Pedachenko ever existed, and many parts of the story as recounted by Le Queux fall apart when examined closely.<ref>Begg, p. 309</ref> For example, one of the sources named in the manuscript was a London-based Russian journalist called Nideroest, who was known for inventing sensational stories. Reviewers of Le Queux's book were aware of Nideroest's background, and unabashedly referred to him as an \"unscrupulous liar\".<ref>Quoted in Rumbelow, p.198</ref> Pedachenko was promoted as a suspect by [[Donald McCormick]], who may have developed the story by adding his own inventions.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 147</ref>\n\n===Walter Sickert===\n{{Main article|Walter Sickert}}\n[[File:Walter Sickert photo by George Charles Beresford 1911 (1).jpg|left|60px|Walter Sickert]]'''Walter Richard Sickert''' (31 May 1860 \u2013 22 January 1942) was a German-born artist of British and Danish ancestry, who was first mentioned as a possible Ripper suspect in [[Donald McCormick]]'s book ''The Identity of Jack the Ripper'' (1959).<ref>Knight, p.250</ref> He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, going so far as to stay in a room that was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings.

Harrison dismissed the idea that Albert Victor was the Ripper but instead suggested that Stephen, a poet and one of Albert Victor's tutors from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], was a more likely suspect. Harrison's suggestion was based on Stephen's misogynistic writings and on similarities between his handwriting and that of the [[From Hell letter|\"From Hell\"]] letter, supposedly written by the Ripper. Harrison supposed that Stephen may have had sexual feelings for Albert Victor, and that Stephen's hatred of women arose from jealousy because Albert Victor preferred female company and did not reciprocate Stephen's feelings.<ref>[[Michael Harrison (writer)|Harrison, Michael]] (1972).

[[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] argued that the murders were a [[Jack_the_Ripper:_The_Final_Solution|conspiracy]] involving multiple miscreants,<ref>Knight, Stephen (1976). ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]''.</ref> whereas others have proposed that each murder was committed by unconnected individuals acting independently of each other (which, if true, would mean there never actually was a single \"Ripper\" at all).<ref>e.g. Turnbull, Peter (1996). ''The Killer Who Never Was: A Re-appraisal of the Whitechapel Murders of 1888''. {{ISBN|1-900540-00-2}}</ref>\n\nThe police of the time believed the Ripper was a local Whitechapel resident.<ref>Robert Anderson's memoirs, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 626\u2013633</ref> His apparent ability to disappear immediately after the killings suggests an intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel neighbourhood, including its back alleys and hiding places.<ref>A \"Scotland Yard official\" quoted in the ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 8 April 1892, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 577\u2013578</ref> However, the population of Whitechapel was largely transient, impoverished and often used aliases. The lives of many of its residents were little recorded. Despite continued interest in the case and ongoing investigation by both professional and amateur researchers, the Ripper's true identity will almost certainly never be known.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Begg, Paul (2003).

[[hyphen]] \"<span style=\"font-family:lucida grande,sans-serif\">-</span>\" that is longer, roughly of an [[en-dash]] width;\n* The [[at sign|commercial at]] \"<span style=\"font-family:lucida

graphical and web-based) uses.\n\n'''Note''': If you have installed Lucida Grande font on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Linux]] you will see followings above.\n\n==Uses==\nApart from [[macOS]] releases prior to [[OS X Yosemite]], many [[website]]s and [[blog]]s use Lucida Grande as the default typeface for body text, for example [[Facebook]] and many [[phpBB]] [[message board|forum]]s. Since this typeface is usually absent from most other operating systems like Windows and [[Linux]], the [[CSS]] [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheet]]s of these websites often include the fonts (usually [[Sans-serif]]: [[Tahoma (typeface)|Tahoma]], [[Verdana]], [[Trebuchet MS]], [[Segoe UI]], [[Calibri]], [[DejaVu fonts|DejaVu Sans]], [[Arial]], [[Open Sans]], or even [[Lucida Sans|Lucida Sans Unicode]], in case Lucida Grande is unavailable for rendering. After the introduction of OS X Yosemite where Lucida Grande is no longer used as the default system font, [https://github.com/schreiberstein several] developers have created [https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeyosemite utilities] to bring Lucida Grande back as the default system font.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/mac-and-i/meldung/OS-X-10-10-Hack-stellt-alte-Schriftart-wieder-her-2435073.html|title=OS X 10.10: Hack stellt alte Schriftart wieder her|last=i|first=Mac &|website=Mac & i|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it was designed primarily as a screen font, Lucida Grande/Sans also appears frequently in print, due at least in part to the ubiquity of Mac platform (and thus the typeface) in professional-grade desktop publishing. The [[Getty-Dubay]] ''Italic Handwriting Series'' of [[penmanship]] workbooks in particular is typeset primarily in a specially modified version of Lucida Sans (with a cursive lowercase \"y\"), as its monoline italic bears a close resemblance to the form of writing that the program teaches.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lucida Sans Unicode]]\n*[[List of typefaces included with macOS]]\n*[[Unicode fonts]]\n*[[Sans-serif]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Lucida Grande}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180611200247/http://lucidafonts.com/fonts/family/lucida-grande/samples Lucida Grande Text Samples - Light, Normal, Bold, Black]\n* [http://lucidafonts.com/fonts/family/lucida-grande-mono/samples Lucida Grande Mono Text Samples - Normal, Bold]\n{{OS X typefaces}}\n[[Category:Humanist sans-serif typefaces]]\n[[Category:Unicode typefaces]]\n[[Category:Apple Inc. typefaces]]\n[[Category:Typefaces designed by Charles Bigelow (type designer)]]\n[[Category:Typefaces designed by Kris Holmes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2008}}\n\n{{infobox typeface\n| name             = Lucida Grande\n| familyname       = [[Lucida (font)|Lucida]]\n| image            = LucidaGrandeSpecAIB.svg\n| style            = [[Sans-serif]]\n| classifications  = [[Sans-serif#Classification|Humanist]]\n| creator          = [[Charles Bigelow (type designer)|Charles Bigelow]]<br>[[Kris Holmes]]\n| foundry          = Bigelow & Holmes\n| releasedate      = 2000\n}}\n\n'''Lucida Grande''' is a [[Sans-serif#Humanist|humanist]] sans-serif [[typeface]]. It is a member of the [[Lucida (font)|Lucida]] family of typefaces designed by [[Charles Bigelow (type designer)|Charles Bigelow]] and [[Kris Holmes]]. It has been used throughout the [[macOS]] user interface from 1999 to 2014, as well as in [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] up to the browser's version 3.2.3 released on 12 May 2009. As of [[OS X Yosemite]] (version 10.10), the system font was changed from Lucida Grande to [[Helvetica Neue]].<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5773838/apple-os-x-yosemite-changes-system-font-for-first-time</ref> In [[OS X El Capitan]] (version 10.11) the system font changed again, this time to [[San Francisco (sans-serif typeface)|San Francisco]].<ref name=\"Apple Developer Fonts\">{{cite web | url=https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ | title=Fonts | website=Apple Developer | publisher=Apple Inc. | accessdate=2015-06-13}}</ref>\n\nThe typeface looks very similar to [[Lucida Sans]] and [[Lucida Sans Unicode]]. Like Sans Unicode, Grande supports the most commonly used characters defined in version 2.0 of the [[Unicode]] standard.\n\nThree [[weight (typography)|weight]]s of Lucida Grande: Normal, Bold, and Black, in three styles: Roman, Italic, and Oblique, were developed by Bigelow & Holmes. Apple released the Regular (Normal Roman) and Bold Roman with OS X.\n\nIn June, 2014, Bigelow & Holmes released four weights: Light, Normal, Bold, and Black, in three styles: Roman, Italic, and Oblique. B&H also released Narrow versions of those twelve weight/styles, plus four Lucida Grande Monospaced fonts in Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic styles, with narrow versions of the four monospaced weight/styles.<ref>[http://lucidafonts.com/pages/facts#ShortHistoryOfLucidaGrande A Brief History of Lucida Grande]</ref>\n\nLucida Grande fonts directly from Bigelow & Holmes contain the pan-European WGL character set.\n\n==Scripts and Unicode ranges==\nLucida Grande contains 2,826 Unicode-encoded [[glyph]]s (2,245 characters) in version 5.0d8e1 (Revision 1.002).\n\nLanguage support by

It was released on November 2, 1999, by [[Columbia Records]]. The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous two albums, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995) and ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997), in which she began her transition into the [[Urban music|urban]] market. ''Rainbow'' contains a mix of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] jams, as well as a variety of slow ballads. On the album, Carey worked with [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]], who, as well as [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]], replaced [[Walter Afanasieff]], the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s. As a result of her separation from her husband, [[Tommy Mottola]], Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several artists such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], and [[Snoop Dogg]], as well as [[Missy Elliott]], [[Joe (singer)|Joe]], [[Da Brat]], [[Master P]], [[98 Degrees|98\u00b0]], and [[Mystikal]].\n\nOn Carey's previous album, ''Butterfly'', she began incorporating several other genres, including R&B and hip hop, into her musical repertoire. In order to further push her musical horizons, Carey featured Jay-Z on the album's lead single, the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles. Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R&B than [[Pop music|pop]] for this album, and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as \"Crybaby\" and \"How Much,\" both of which featured strong R&B beats and grooves. Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period, including \"[[Thank God I Found You]]\" (written with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]]) and \"After Tonight\" (written with Diane Warren), mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, two of which became number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, making ''Rainbow'' her seventh-consecutive studio album to produce a number-one song. The album's lead single, \"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]\" featuring Jay-Z, became Carey's fourteenth number-one hit on the Hot 100, and topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand. \"[[Thank God I Found You]],\" featuring [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and [[98 Degrees]], also topped the Hot 100, but achieved moderate international charting. The next two singles, \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]] and \"[[Crybaby (Mariah Carey song)|Crybaby]]\" featuring Snoop Dogg, were released as a [[double A-side]]. The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony due to Sony's alleged weak promotion of the singles. Carey's cover of [[Phil Collins]]' \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]\" with [[Westlife]] peaked at number one in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n''Rainbow'' was well received by critics, who generally praised Carey's embrace of R&B and hip hop in her music. The album debuted at number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]], with first week sales of 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. However, within a month, ''Rainbow'' was certified triple-[[RIAA certifications|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States. Internationally, the album debuted atop the charts in France, and within the top five in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. The album has sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide.\n\n==Background==\nSince her debut in 1990, Carey's career was heavily calculated and controlled by her husband and head of her label [[Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref name=\"shapiro2\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=91\u201392}}</ref> For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced melodies. In January 1995, as she recorded ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences.<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> She enlisted the production skills and [[Rapping|rap]] styles of [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], who was featured on the remix of her song \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]].\" While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's persistence paid off<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> when the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling the collaboration one of the pioneering songs of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musical collaborations.<ref name=\"shapiro3\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=93}}</ref>\n\nDuring the recording and production of Carey's ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' in 1997, she and Mottola separated, giving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album.<ref name=\"shapiro3\"/> Following their separation, Carey began working with younger hip hop and R&B producers and songwriters, aside from her usual work with balladeers [[Walter Afanasieff]] and [[Kenneth Edmonds]].<ref name=\"shapiro4\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=94}}</ref> While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey's previous releases, ''Butterfly'' also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R&B-infused jams.<ref name=\"shapiro4\"/> While Sony accepted Carey's new collaborations with writers and producers such as [[P. Diddy]] and [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], they continued to focus their promotion on the ballads. After \"[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]],\" the debut single from ''Butterfly'', was released in August 1997, Sony halted the release of the succeeding R&B-influenced jams, and released the ballad \"[[My All]]\" as the second worldwide single. ''Rainbow'' followed in its predecessors' footsteps, featuring even more hip hop and R&B.<ref name=\"shapiro4\"/>\n\n==Writing and recording==\nDuring the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony, her ex-husband's label.<ref name=\"shapiro5\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=121}}</ref> Carey's lover at the time, [[Luis Miguel]], was in the midst of a European tour. In order to spend more time with him, she opted to record the album on the secluded island of [[Capri]], Italy, figuring the seclusion would also help her complete the album sooner.<ref name=\"shapiro5\"/> During this time, Carey's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff, who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career.<ref name=\"shapiro5\"/> Aside from their growing creative differences, Mottola had given Afanasieff more opportunities to work with other artists.<ref name=\"shapiro6\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=122}}</ref> She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff, in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> In an interview with ''Blitz TV'', Carey spoke of her decision to record the album in Capri:\n<blockquote>\nI love New York. But if I'm there, I want to go out, friends come to the studio, the phone rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, and there is no one I can run into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to effectively finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [Sony] was becoming increasingly difficult.<ref name=\"shapiro5\"/>\n</blockquote>\nLike her previous releases, Carey co-wrote and co-produced the album's material, working with several hip hop and R&B producers such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], and [[Brian Michael Cox]].<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> For the album's debut single release, Carey collaborated with Jay-Z and DJ Clue.<ref name=\"bronson\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=888}}</ref> During the spring of 1999, Carey began working with Clue on several [[hook (music)|hooks]] and melodies for the lead single. After a few hours, they decided to include a hip hop star on the track, which eventually led to Jay-Z.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Carey's longtime friend and back-up vocalist [[Trey Lorenz]], who was featured on her remake of the [[Jackson 5]] song \"[[I'll Be There (Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]],\" added \"some soft male [back-up] vocals.\"<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Carey worked with Lewis and Jam on the ballad \"[[Thank God I Found You]].\"<ref name=\"bronson2\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=892}}</ref> She had already been in the studio with the duo several times when she contacted them to meet her at the studio, where she told them that she had come up with the title, hook, and melody. Usually, when Carey was writing the songs for ''Rainbow'', James \"Big Jim\" Wright would play the organ or piano and assist Carey to find the \"right melody.\"<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> However, since Wright was not present, Lewis played the organ while Carey directed him with her [[vocal range|lower registers]], providing the [[chord progression]]. They composed the song and recorded Carey's vocals. Knowing she wanted to introduce a male vocalist on the track, Lewis brought R&B singer [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and pop group [[98 Degrees]] into the studio.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> After a few hours, the group and Joe had recorded all their vocals and the song was complete.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> In an interview with Bronson, Lewis discussed the night Carey wrote \"Thank God I Found You:\"\n<blockquote>\nIt all happened that night. She told us the title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile the album was immersed further into mainstream R&B territory, Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album, working with writers and producers such as [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]].<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster, who thought that the two would be able to \"hammer out one hell of a ballad\" together.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> The two wrote and produced the song titled \"After Tonight.\" Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel, describing their romance in Capri. While the song was deemed a success by both parties, they described their working relationship with mixed feelings.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> According to Foster, who was involved in the writing session, Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song. He described it as a \"give and take relationship\"; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey would not like them; she wanted something more intricate and detailed. Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> In the end, Foster felt that they worked \"well together.\" After recording the song, Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet.<ref name=\"shapiro7\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=123}}</ref> However, after recording his verses several times, Foster and Carey realized that the song would not turn out the way they planned.<ref name=\"shapiro7\"/> Foster said the song's key was \"too high for him\"; the voices did not harmonize well. Carey did not have time to re-record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel's verses.<ref name=\"shapiro7\"/> Miguel, furious over the failed collaboration, later sent a cut-up tape of the demo to Foster. Carey, Warren, and Foster also wrote \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]],\" one of the other ballads featured on ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"shapiro7\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"It was from the standpoint of girls who keep going back to the same guy and they can't help themselves. They know they're going to get hurt. I've been one of those girls, so I know there's a lot of them out there.\"|source=\u2014Carey, describing the lyrics of \"Heartbreaker\"\n }}\nAs with ''Butterfly'', songs for ''Rainbow'' were chosen to solidify Carey's reputation as a multi-genre artist.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Throughout the first phase of her career, Carey's albums predominantly consisted of pop and adult contemporary ballads. ''Rainbow'' mixed hip hop and R&B-flavored upbeat songs with softer and lyrically intense ballads resembling those that Carey had previously recorded.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> \"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]],\" Carey's first collaboration with Jay-Z, used a sample from \"Attack of the Name Game,\" recorded by [[Stacy Lattisaw]], as its hook. The loop originated from \"The Name Game\" by [[Shirley Ellis]];<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Ellis and co-writer [[Lincoln Chase]] are credited as songwriters on the track. Carey incorporated the hook into the song's melody, and added instrumentation.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Lyrically, the song chronicles the heartbreak the protagonist feels after learning of her lover's infidelity. \"[[Thank God I Found You]]\" features vocals from Joe and 98 Degrees, as well as songwriting and production from Carey and Lewis.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> According to Carey, the song reflects on events in her own life at the time, with the lyrics describing the completion the protagonist feels after \"finding\" their lover. Joe provides the main male vocal throughout each verse, and 98 Degrees sing the background vocals and the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].<ref name=\"bronson2\"/>\n\nPrior to the album's recording, Mariah and her sister, Alison Carey had a falling out in their relationship.<ref name=\"shapiro8\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> Alison had contracted [[AIDS]] in 1988, when she was 27, and in 1994 she blamed Mariah for many of her problems and heartbreaks throughout the years. Her children were taken away while she received treatment for AIDS and for mental health issues.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> Carey wrote a song titled \"Petals,\" which she describes as the most honest lyrics she has ever written. The song tells of Carey's feelings for her sister, while illustrating the pain Allison's betrayal and suffering have caused.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> In an interview with Bronson, Carey described the meaning of the lyrics of \"Petals\":\n<blockquote>\nIt is a great outlet for me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most personal songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [it had the most] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go hand in hand with the song's composition.<ref name=\"bronson\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\"After Tonight\" was a song Carey wrote with David Foster and Diane Warren. Carey had strong feelings about the song, as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel.<ref name=\"shapiro11\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref> The song was compared instrumentally to \"[[My All]]\" from ''Butterfly'', which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> In the lyrics, the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her and come back to her \"after tonight.\" Carey's cover of the [[Phil Collins]] song \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]\" was originally intended to be a solo ballad. The song was re-done after the album was released, with music by the Irish band [[Westlife]] replacing the song's instrumental bridge.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]\" was one of the album's most uplifting ballads, lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners. The message, Carey said, was a personal theme of hers growing up, of not letting others \"bring her down\" and not allowing them to take away the light inside her.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/>\n\"How Much\" is a duet with [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] and features a sample from [[Tupac Shakur]]'s \"Me and My Girlfriend.\"\n\n==Conflict with Sony==\nAs with ''Butterfly'' two years earlier, ''Rainbow'' became the center of conflict between Carey and her label.<ref name=\"shapiro10\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref> After her divorce from Sony record official and Columbia CEO Tommy Mottola, Carey's working relationship with the label deteriorated. She intended for \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" to be the third single from ''Rainbow'', as it held very personal lyrical content. However, Sony made it clear that they intended the third single should be a more upbeat and urban track.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> The difference in opinion led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid-2000, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> One of the messages Carey left on her page read:\n<blockquote>\nBasically, a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/>\n</blockquote>\nCarey's actions were given mixed reception, with critics and executives commending her bold actions regarding a song she felt needed to be heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the dispute further.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> Soon after, Sony stripped Carey's webpage of messages and began negotiations. Fearing to lose their label's highest seller and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart, and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/>\n\n==Promotion==\n{{Main article|Rainbow World Tour}}\nPrior to the album's release, Carey made an appearance on ''[[Pavarotti & Friends for Guatemala and Kosovo]]'', performing \"My All\" and \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\" alongside [[Luciano Pavarotti]] in a live duet.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> The concert benefit was filmed live in [[Modena]], Italy, during the summer of 1999 and was released for sale on September 21, with funds being donated to relief efforts for natural disasters in [[Guatemala]] and [[Kosovo]].<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> Carey made several live television and award show appearances at this time, and recorded her own [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] special,<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> titled ''The Mariah Carey Homecoming Special''. A mini-concert filmed at Carey's old high school in Huntington, New York, the special aired on Fox on December 21, 1999.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> Carey performed \"Heartbreaker\" and its accompanying remix at the [[1999 MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV European Music Awards]], held on November 11, 1999, in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Additionally, the song was performed on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', the British music chart program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', which included a performance of \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" and \"Hero.\"<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> \"Thank God I Found You was performed live at the 2000 [[American Music Awards of 2000|American Music Awards]] as well as on several European programs, including ''Top of the Pops'' and ''[[Ian Wright|Friday Night's All Wright]]'' in the United Kingdom, [[NRJ Radio|NRJ]] and ''[[European Golden Shoe|Soulier d'Or]]'' in France, ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'' in Germany, and ''[[Quelli che... il Calcio]]'' in Italy.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> The album's final two releases, \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" and \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),\" were performed on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and at the 2000 [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster Entertainment Awards]].<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/>\n\nIn order to promote ''Rainbow'', Carey embarked of her fourth headlining and third worldwide tour. Titled the [[Rainbow World Tour]], it included nineteen shows: six in Europe, four in Asia, eight in the United States, and one in Canada.<ref name=\"shapiro9\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref> For Carey's previous two tours, she had only visited Europe and Asia, due to the mixed reception of her [[Music Box Tour|debut stateside tour]] in 1993.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> However, after achieving record-breaking ticket sales throughout Asia and instant sellouts in Europe, Carey felt secure enough to once again tour her native country. The [[set list]] featured songs from most of Carey's previous studio albums, as well as some tracks from ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Da Brat]] served as opening acts for the US leg of the tour. Ticket sales were very strong; the entire US leg sold out in a matter of days. The Asian and European leg mirrored the commercial success of her previous two tours.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> Reviews for the tour varied from positive to mixed. Some critics and fans reproached her of having a \"tired and hoarse voice,\" while others commented on Carey's choice of wardrobe. Several critics and many concert-goers praised the tour, calling it an intense celebration of Carey's career.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/>\n\n===Singles===\n[[File:Mariah Carey Charmbracelet London.jpg|thumb|left|Carey performing the lead single \"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]\" live on her [[Charmbracelet World Tour]] in 2003.]]\nFive singles were released from ''Rainbow''; two were worldwide international releases and three were limited promotional releases. \"Heartbreaker,\" the album's first worldwide release, became Carey's fourteenth chart topper in the United States.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot 100\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=Hot 100}}|title=Mariah Carey Album & Song Chart History: Hot 100|work=Billboard|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> Aside from staying atop the US chart for two weeks, the song reached the chart's summit in Canada and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Canadian Hot 100\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=Billboard Canadian Hot 100}}|title=Canadian Hot 100|work=Billboard|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Elsewhere, \"Heartbreaker\" achieved high charting, peaking within the top five in France and the United Kingdom, and within the top ten in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland.<ref name=nz>{{cite web|url=https://charts.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Mariah+Carey|title=New Zealand Charts - Mariah Carey|work=charts.nz|publisher= Hung Medien|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref><ref name=ger>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Carey%2CMariah?sort=entry&type=longplay|title=Chartverfolgung / Carey, Mariah / Longplay|language=German|publisher=musicline.de PhonoNet|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}</ref> The song received mixed reviews from critics. Arion Berger from ''Rolling Stone'' called the song Carey's \"most insinuating: nasal, silken, declarative, riding the percolating beat.\"<ref name=rs/> However, while dismissing some of the song's vocals and the incorporation of the hook, he complimented its marriage of pop and hip hop through Jay-Z's verses.<ref name=rs/> The song's music video became one of the most expensive music videos of all time, costing an estimated $2.5 million.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> The video features Carey visiting a movie theater with her friends, where she finds her lover with another woman. \"Thank God I Found You\" was released as the second worldwide single from the album. While becoming Carey's fifteenth chart topper in the US, the song achieved moderate chart success in Europe and other territories. Berger called it a \"gospel soar\" and complimented Carey's vocals, as well as the harmonies by 98 Degrees.<ref name=rs/> The music video features footage from a live concert with Carey and the band performing the song.\n\n\"[[Crybaby (Mariah Carey song)|Crybaby]]\" and \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" were released simultaneously as a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]], with very limited promotion from Sony.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> These two songs, especially the latter, became the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label, due to their alleged low promotion of the album.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> Carey and Snoop Dogg were featured in the music video for \"Crybaby,\" with Carey playing an anxious woman who can't sleep at night due to her lover's infidelity. A music video for \"Can't Take That Away\" was released around the same time, which features Carey on a rooftop garden. Carey sings during a rain storm, and towards the video's conclusion, the sun arises, bring forth a \"new day.\" The final single from ''Rainbow'', \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),\" was given a limited release as well. After performing moderately around the world, a new version of the song, featuring [[Westlife]], was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> It became successful there, peaking at number one in both territories, and became Carey's second UK chart topper.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> The song's video features Carey and Westlife on a boat in Capri. Scenes of the group exploring the island are cut with scenes of them in the studio, though Carey never re-recorded her vocals from the original version.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=allmusic/>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Considine|first=J.

songwriter [[Mariah Carey]]. It was released on November 2, 1999, by [[Columbia Records]]. The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous two albums, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995) and ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997), in which she began her transition into the [[Urban music|urban]] market. ''Rainbow'' contains a mix of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] jams, as well as a variety of slow ballads. On the album, Carey worked with [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]], who, as well as [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]], replaced [[Walter Afanasieff]], the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s. As a result of her separation from her husband, [[Tommy Mottola]], Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several artists such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], and [[Snoop Dogg]], as well as [[Missy Elliott]], [[Joe (singer)|Joe]], [[Da Brat]], [[Master P]], [[98 Degrees|98\u00b0]], and [[Mystikal]].\n\nOn Carey's previous album, ''Butterfly'', she began incorporating several other genres, including R&B and hip hop, into her musical repertoire. In order to further push her musical horizons, Carey featured Jay-Z on the album's lead single, the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles. Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R&B than [[Pop music|pop]] for this album, and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as \"Crybaby\" and \"How Much,\" both of which featured strong R&B beats and grooves. Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period, including \"[[Thank God I Found You]]\" (written with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]]) and \"After Tonight\" (written with Diane Warren), mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, two of which became number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, making ''Rainbow'' her seventh-consecutive studio album to produce a number-one song. The album's lead single, \"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]\" featuring Jay-Z, became Carey's fourteenth number-one hit on the Hot 100, and topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand. \"[[Thank God I Found You]],\" featuring [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and [[98 Degrees]], also topped the Hot 100, but achieved moderate international charting. The next two singles, \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]] and \"[[Crybaby (Mariah Carey song)|Crybaby]]\" featuring Snoop Dogg, were released as a [[double A-side]]. The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony due to Sony's alleged weak promotion of the singles. Carey's cover of [[Phil Collins]]' \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]\" with [[Westlife]] peaked at number one in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n''Rainbow'' was well received by critics, who generally praised Carey's embrace of R&B and hip hop in her music. The album debuted at number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]], with first week sales of 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. However, within a month, ''Rainbow'' was certified triple-[[RIAA certifications|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States. Internationally, the album debuted atop the charts in France, and within the top five in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. The album has sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide.\n\n==Background==\nSince her debut in 1990, Carey's career was heavily calculated and controlled by her husband and head of her label [[Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref name=\"shapiro2\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=91\u201392}}</ref> For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced melodies. In January 1995, as she recorded ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences.<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> She enlisted the production skills and [[Rapping|rap]] styles of [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], who was featured on the remix of her song \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]].\" While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's persistence paid off<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> when the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling the collaboration one of the pioneering songs of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musical collaborations.<ref name=\"shapiro3\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=93}}</ref>\n\nDuring the recording and production of Carey's ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' in 1997, she and Mottola separated, giving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album.<ref name=\"shapiro3\"/> Following their separation, Carey began working with younger hip hop and R&B producers and songwriters, aside from her usual work with balladeers [[Walter Afanasieff]] and [[Kenneth Edmonds]].<ref name=\"shapiro4\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=94}}</ref> While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey's previous releases, ''Butterfly'' also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R&B-infused jams.<ref name=\"shapiro4\"/> While Sony accepted Carey's new collaborations with writers and producers such as [[P. Diddy]] and [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], they continued to focus their promotion on the ballads. After \"[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]],\" the debut single from ''Butterfly'', was released in August 1997, Sony halted the release of the succeeding R&B-influenced jams, and released the ballad \"[[My All]]\" as the second worldwide single. ''Rainbow'' followed in its predecessors' footsteps, featuring even more hip hop and R&B.<ref name=\"shapiro4\"/>\n\n==Writing and recording==\nDuring the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony, her ex-husband's label.<ref name=\"shapiro5\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=121}}</ref> Carey's lover at the time, [[Luis Miguel]], was in the midst of a European tour. In order to spend more time with him, she opted to record the album on the secluded island of [[Capri]], Italy, figuring the seclusion would also help her complete the album sooner.<ref name=\"shapiro5\"/> During this time, Carey's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff, who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career.<ref name=\"shapiro5\"/> Aside from their growing creative differences, Mottola had given Afanasieff more opportunities to work with other artists.<ref name=\"shapiro6\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=122}}</ref> She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff, in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> In an interview with ''Blitz TV'', Carey spoke of her decision to record the album in Capri:\n<blockquote>\nI love New York. But if I'm there, I want to go out, friends come to the studio, the phone rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, and there is no one I can run into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to effectively finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [Sony] was becoming increasingly difficult.<ref name=\"shapiro5\"/>\n</blockquote>\nLike her previous releases, Carey co-wrote and co-produced the album's material, working with several hip hop and R&B producers such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], and [[Brian Michael Cox]].<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> For the album's debut single release, Carey collaborated with Jay-Z and DJ Clue.<ref name=\"bronson\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=888}}</ref> During the spring of 1999, Carey began working with Clue on several [[hook (music)|hooks]] and melodies for the lead single. After a few hours, they decided to include a hip hop star on the track, which eventually led to Jay-Z.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Carey's longtime friend and back-up vocalist [[Trey Lorenz]], who was featured on her remake of the [[Jackson 5]] song \"[[I'll Be There (Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]],\" added \"some soft male [back-up] vocals.\"<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Carey worked with Lewis and Jam on the ballad \"[[Thank God I Found You]].\"<ref name=\"bronson2\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=892}}</ref> She had already been in the studio with the duo several times when she contacted them to meet her at the studio, where she told them that she had come up with the title, hook, and melody. Usually, when Carey was writing the songs for ''Rainbow'', James \"Big Jim\" Wright would play the organ or piano and assist Carey to find the \"right melody.\"<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> However, since Wright was not present, Lewis played the organ while Carey directed him with her [[vocal range|lower registers]], providing the [[chord progression]]. They composed the song and recorded Carey's vocals. Knowing she wanted to introduce a male vocalist on the track, Lewis brought R&B singer [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and pop group [[98 Degrees]] into the studio.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> After a few hours, the group and Joe had recorded all their vocals and the song was complete.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> In an interview with Bronson, Lewis discussed the night Carey wrote \"Thank God I Found You:\"\n<blockquote>\nIt all happened that night. She told us the title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile the album was immersed further into mainstream R&B territory, Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album, working with writers and producers such as [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]].<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster, who thought that the two would be able to \"hammer out one hell of a ballad\" together.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> The two wrote and produced the song titled \"After Tonight.\" Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel, describing their romance in Capri. While the song was deemed a success by both parties, they described their working relationship with mixed feelings.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> According to Foster, who was involved in the writing session, Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song. He described it as a \"give and take relationship\"; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey would not like them; she wanted something more intricate and detailed. Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit.<ref name=\"shapiro6\"/> In the end, Foster felt that they worked \"well together.\" After recording the song, Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet.<ref name=\"shapiro7\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=123}}</ref> However, after recording his verses several times, Foster and Carey realized that the song would not turn out the way they planned.<ref name=\"shapiro7\"/> Foster said the song's key was \"too high for him\"; the voices did not harmonize well. Carey did not have time to re-record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel's verses.<ref name=\"shapiro7\"/> Miguel, furious over the failed collaboration, later sent a cut-up tape of the demo to Foster. Carey, Warren, and Foster also wrote \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]],\" one of the other ballads featured on ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"shapiro7\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote=\"It was from the standpoint of girls who keep going back to the same guy and they can't help themselves. They know they're going to get hurt. I've been one of those girls, so I know there's a lot of them out there.\"|source=\u2014Carey, describing the lyrics of \"Heartbreaker\"\n }}\nAs with ''Butterfly'', songs for ''Rainbow'' were chosen to solidify Carey's reputation as a multi-genre artist.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Throughout the first phase of her career, Carey's albums predominantly consisted of pop and adult contemporary ballads. ''Rainbow'' mixed hip hop and R&B-flavored upbeat songs with softer and lyrically intense ballads resembling those that Carey had previously recorded.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> \"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]],\" Carey's first collaboration with Jay-Z, used a sample from \"Attack of the Name Game,\" recorded by [[Stacy Lattisaw]], as its hook. The loop originated from \"The Name Game\" by [[Shirley Ellis]];<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Ellis and co-writer [[Lincoln Chase]] are credited as songwriters on the track. Carey incorporated the hook into the song's melody, and added instrumentation.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> Lyrically, the song chronicles the heartbreak the protagonist feels after learning of her lover's infidelity. \"[[Thank God I Found You]]\" features vocals from Joe and 98 Degrees, as well as songwriting and production from Carey and Lewis.<ref name=\"bronson2\"/> According to Carey, the song reflects on events in her own life at the time, with the lyrics describing the completion the protagonist feels after \"finding\" their lover. Joe provides the main male vocal throughout each verse, and 98 Degrees sing the background vocals and the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].<ref name=\"bronson2\"/>\n\nPrior to the album's recording, Mariah and her sister, Alison Carey had a falling out in their relationship.<ref name=\"shapiro8\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> Alison had contracted [[AIDS]] in 1988, when she was 27, and in 1994 she blamed Mariah for many of her problems and heartbreaks throughout the years. Her children were taken away while she received treatment for AIDS and for mental health issues.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> Carey wrote a song titled \"Petals,\" which she describes as the most honest lyrics she has ever written. The song tells of Carey's feelings for her sister, while illustrating the pain Allison's betrayal and suffering have caused.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> In an interview with Bronson, Carey described the meaning of the lyrics of \"Petals\":\n<blockquote>\nIt is a great outlet for me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most personal songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [it had the most] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go hand in hand with the song's composition.<ref name=\"bronson\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\"After Tonight\" was a song Carey wrote with David Foster and Diane Warren. Carey had strong feelings about the song, as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel.<ref name=\"shapiro11\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref> The song was compared instrumentally to \"[[My All]]\" from ''Butterfly'', which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> In the lyrics, the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her and come back to her \"after tonight.\" Carey's cover of the [[Phil Collins]] song \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]\" was originally intended to be a solo ballad. The song was re-done after the album was released, with music by the Irish band [[Westlife]] replacing the song's instrumental bridge.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> \"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]\" was one of the album's most uplifting ballads, lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners. The message, Carey said, was a personal theme of hers growing up, of not letting others \"bring her down\" and not allowing them to take away the light inside her.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/>\n\"How Much\" is a duet with [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] and features a sample from [[Tupac Shakur]]'s \"Me and My Girlfriend.\"\n\n==Conflict with Sony==\nAs with ''Butterfly'' two years earlier, ''Rainbow'' became the center of conflict between Carey and her label.<ref name=\"shapiro10\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref> After her divorce from Sony record official and Columbia CEO Tommy Mottola, Carey's working relationship with the label deteriorated. She intended for \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" to be the third single from ''Rainbow'', as it held very personal lyrical content. However, Sony made it clear that they intended the third single should be a more upbeat and urban track.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> The difference in opinion led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid-2000, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> One of the messages Carey left on her page read:\n<blockquote>\nBasically, a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/>\n</blockquote>\nCarey's actions were given mixed reception, with critics and executives commending her bold actions regarding a song she felt needed to be heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the dispute further.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> Soon after, Sony stripped Carey's webpage of messages and began negotiations. Fearing to lose their label's highest seller and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart, and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/>\n\n==Promotion==\n{{Main article|Rainbow World Tour}}\nPrior to the album's release, Carey made an appearance on ''[[Pavarotti & Friends for Guatemala and Kosovo]]'', performing \"My All\" and \"[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]\" alongside [[Luciano Pavarotti]] in a live duet.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> The concert benefit was filmed live in [[Modena]], Italy, during the summer of 1999 and was released for sale on September 21, with funds being donated to relief efforts for natural disasters in [[Guatemala]] and [[Kosovo]].<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> Carey made several live television and award show appearances at this time, and recorded her own [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] special,<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> titled ''The Mariah Carey Homecoming Special''. A mini-concert filmed at Carey's old high school in Huntington, New York, the special aired on Fox on December 21, 1999.<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/> Carey performed \"Heartbreaker\" and its accompanying remix at the [[1999 MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV European Music Awards]], held on November 11, 1999, in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Additionally, the song was performed on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', the British music chart program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', which included a performance of \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" and \"Hero.\"<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> \"Thank God I Found You was performed live at the 2000 [[American Music Awards of 2000|American Music Awards]] as well as on several European programs, including ''Top of the Pops'' and ''[[Ian Wright|Friday Night's All Wright]]'' in the United Kingdom, [[NRJ Radio|NRJ]] and ''[[European Golden Shoe|Soulier d'Or]]'' in France, ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'' in Germany, and ''[[Quelli che... il Calcio]]'' in Italy.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> The album's final two releases, \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" and \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),\" were performed on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and at the 2000 [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster Entertainment Awards]].<ref name=\"shapiro10\"/>\n\nIn order to promote ''Rainbow'', Carey embarked of her fourth headlining and third worldwide tour. Titled the [[Rainbow World Tour]], it included nineteen shows: six in Europe, four in Asia, eight in the United States, and one in Canada.<ref name=\"shapiro9\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref> For Carey's previous two tours, she had only visited Europe and Asia, due to the mixed reception of her [[Music Box Tour|debut stateside tour]] in 1993.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> However, after achieving record-breaking ticket sales throughout Asia and instant sellouts in Europe, Carey felt secure enough to once again tour her native country. The [[set list]] featured songs from most of Carey's previous studio albums, as well as some tracks from ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Da Brat]] served as opening acts for the US leg of the tour. Ticket sales were very strong; the entire US leg sold out in a matter of days. The Asian and European leg mirrored the commercial success of her previous two tours.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/> Reviews for the tour varied from positive to mixed. Some critics and fans reproached her of having a \"tired and hoarse voice,\" while others commented on Carey's choice of wardrobe. Several critics and many concert-goers praised the tour, calling it an intense celebration of Carey's career.<ref name=\"shapiro9\"/>\n\n===Singles===\n[[File:Mariah Carey Charmbracelet London.jpg|thumb|left|Carey performing the lead single \"[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]\" live on her [[Charmbracelet World Tour]] in 2003.]]\nFive singles were released from ''Rainbow''; two were worldwide international releases and three were limited promotional releases. \"Heartbreaker,\" the album's first worldwide release, became Carey's fourteenth chart topper in the United States.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot 100\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=Hot 100}}|title=Mariah Carey Album & Song Chart History: Hot 100|work=Billboard|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> Aside from staying atop the US chart for two weeks, the song reached the chart's summit in Canada and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Canadian Hot 100\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=Billboard Canadian Hot 100}}|title=Canadian Hot 100|work=Billboard|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Elsewhere, \"Heartbreaker\" achieved high charting, peaking within the top five in France and the United Kingdom, and within the top ten in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland.<ref name=nz>{{cite web|url=https://charts.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Mariah+Carey|title=New Zealand Charts - Mariah Carey|work=charts.nz|publisher= Hung Medien|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref><ref name=ger>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Carey%2CMariah?sort=entry&type=longplay|title=Chartverfolgung / Carey, Mariah / Longplay|language=German|publisher=musicline.de PhonoNet|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}</ref> The song received mixed reviews from critics. Arion Berger from ''Rolling Stone'' called the song Carey's \"most insinuating: nasal, silken, declarative, riding the percolating beat.\"<ref name=rs/> However, while dismissing some of the song's vocals and the incorporation of the hook, he complimented its marriage of pop and hip hop through Jay-Z's verses.<ref name=rs/> The song's music video became one of the most expensive music videos of all time, costing an estimated $2.5 million.<ref name=\"bronson\"/> The video features Carey visiting a movie theater with her friends, where she finds her lover with another woman. \"Thank God I Found You\" was released as the second worldwide single from the album. While becoming Carey's fifteenth chart topper in the US, the song achieved moderate chart success in Europe and other territories. Berger called it a \"gospel soar\" and complimented Carey's vocals, as well as the harmonies by 98 Degrees.<ref name=rs/> The music video features footage from a live concert with Carey and the band performing the song.\n\n\"[[Crybaby (Mariah Carey song)|Crybaby]]\" and \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" were released simultaneously as a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]], with very limited promotion from Sony.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> These two songs, especially the latter, became the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label, due to their alleged low promotion of the album.<ref name=\"shapiro8\"/> Carey and Snoop Dogg were featured in the music video for \"Crybaby,\" with Carey playing an anxious woman who can't sleep at night due to her lover's infidelity. A music video for \"Can't Take That Away\" was released around the same time, which features Carey on a rooftop garden. Carey sings during a rain storm, and towards the video's conclusion, the sun arises, bring forth a \"new day.\" The final single from ''Rainbow'', \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),\" was given a limited release as well. After performing moderately around the world, a new version of the song, featuring [[Westlife]], was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> It became successful there, peaking at number one in both territories, and became Carey's second UK chart topper.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/> The song's video features Carey and Westlife on a boat in Capri. Scenes of the group exploring the island are cut with scenes of them in the studio, though Carey never re-recorded her vocals from the original version.<ref name=\"shapiro11\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=allmusic/>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Considine|first=J.
