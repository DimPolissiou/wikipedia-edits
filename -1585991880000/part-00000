After the swayamvara,  she accompanies her husband to his kingdom, but later chooses to accompany her husband, along with her brother-in-law [[Lakshmana]], in his exile. While in exile, the trio settles in the [[Dandaka]] forest from where she is abducted by [[Ravana]], the [[Rakshasa]] king of [[Lanka]]. She is imprisoned in [[Ashoka Vatika]] in Lanka until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. After the war, in some versions of the epic, Rama asks Sita to undergo Agni Pariksha (an [[Trial by ordeal#By fire|ordeal of fire]]) by which she proves her purity before she is accepted by Rama, which for the first time makes his brother Lakshmana get angry at him.\n\nIn some versions of the epic, the fire-god&nbsp;[[Agni]]&nbsp;creates [[Maya Sita]], who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. During the Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts say that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine&nbsp;[[Draupadi]]&nbsp;or the goddess&nbsp;[[Alamelu|Padmavati]]. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being&nbsp;[[Vedavati]], a woman Ravana tries to molest. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After proving her purity, Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen. After a few months, Sita becomes pregnant, to which a washerman makes insensitive comments on Sita to his wife, which Rama in disguise hears. Rama then sends Sita away on exile.

The Sita of the ''Ramayana'' may have been named after a more ancient [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic goddess]] Sita, who is mentioned once in the [[Rigveda]] as an earth goddess who blesses the land with good crops. In the [[Vedic period]], she was one of the goddesses associated with fertility.

Janaka knew that the bow of Shiva was not even liftable, let alone stringable for ordinary mortals, and for selfish people it was not even approachable. Thus, Janaka tries to find the best husband for Sita.\n\nAt this time, [[Vishvamitra]] had brought Rama and his brother Lakshmana to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing about this ''swayamvara'', Vishvamitra asks Rama to participate in it and takes Rama and Lakshmana to the palace of Janaka in [[Janakpur]]. Janaka is greatly pleased to learn that Rama and Lakshmana are sons of Dasharatha. Next morning, in the middle of the hall, Rama lifts up the bow of Shiva with his left hand, fastens the string taut and breaks the bow in the process. However, another avatar of Vishnu, [[Parashurama]], became really angry as the bow of Shiva was broken. However, he does not realize that Rama is also an avatar of Vishnu, therefore after being informed of this, he apologizes for getting angry. Thus, Rama fulfills Janaka's condition to marry Sita. Later on [[Vivaha Panchami]], a marriage ceremony is conducted under the guidance of Satananda. Rama marries Sita, Bharata marries Mandavi, Lakshmana marries Urmila and Shatrughna marries Shrutakirti.<ref name=Parmeshwaranand />\n\n===Exile and abduction===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|Ravana cuts off Jatayu's wing while abducting Sita]]\nSome time after the wedding, [[Kaikeyi]], Rama's stepmother, compelled Dasharatha to make Bharata king, prompted by the coaxing of her maid [[Manthara]], and forced Rama to leave Ayodhya and spend a period of exile in the forests of [[Dandaka]] and later Panchavati. Sita and Lakshmana willingly renounced the comforts of the palace and joined Rama in exile. The Panchavati forest became the scene for Sita's abduction by Ravana, King of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita, disguising himself as a mendicant, while Rama was away fetching a [[Maricha|golden deer]] to please her. Some versions of the ''Ramayana'' describe Sita taking refuge with the fire-god [[Agni]], while [[Maya Sita]], her illusionary double, is kidnapped by the demon-king. [[Jatayu (Ramayana)|Jatayu]], the vulture-king, tried to protect Sita but Ravana chopped off his wings.

During her captivity for a year in Lanka, Ravana expressed his desire for her; however, Sita refused his advances and struggled to maintain her chastity. [[Hanuman]] was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeded in discovering Sita's whereabouts. Sita gave Hanuman her jewellery and asked him to give it to her husband. Hanuman returned across the sea to Rama.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/>\n\nSita was finally rescued by Rama, who waged a war to defeat Ravana. Upon rescue, Rama makes Sita undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. In some versions of ''Ramayana'', during this test the fire-god Agni appears in front of Rama and attests to Sita's purity, or hands over to him the real Sita and declares it was Maya Sita who was abducted by Ravana.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/> The Thai version of the Ramayana, however, tells of Sita walking on the fire, of her own accord, to feel clean, as opposed to jumping in it. She is not burnt, and the coals turn to lotuses.After proving that Sita is still pure, she returns to Ayodhya. But the citizens of Ayodhaya don't accept Sita and says that she is impure, and ram has to forcefully sent Sita against his wish. After 12 yrs he go backs to Sita and asks her to come back to Ayodhya. But Sita denies and says bhumi to take her inside herself.. Sita goes inside the earth and gives her sons to Rama....\n\n=The life of Sita, after exiling again and the reason of exiling according to mythology=\nThe couple came back to Ayodhya, where Rama was crowned king with Sita by his side.\n\nWhile Rama's trust and affection for Sita never wavered, it soon became evident that some people in Ayodhya could not accept Sita's long captivity under Ravana. During Rama's period of rule, an intemperate [[Dhobi|washerman]], while berating his wayward wife, declared that he was \"no pusillanimous Rama who would take his wife back after she had lived in the house of another man\". This statement was reported back to Rama, who knew that the accusation against Sita was baseless. Nevertheless, he would not let [[slander]] undermine his rule, so he sent Sita away.\n\nThus Sita was forced into exile a second time. Sita, who was pregnant, was given refuge in the hermitage of [[Valmiki]], where she delivered twin sons named [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] and [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]].<ref name=Parmeshwaranand /> In the hermitage, Sita raised her sons alone, as a single mother.<ref name=\"Contemporary Influence of Sita by\">{{cite web|last=Bhargava|first=Anju P.|title=Contemporary Influence of Sita by|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|publisher=The Infinity Foundation|accessdate=31 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713001426/http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They grew up to be valiant and intelligent and were eventually united with their father.

She requested Sita to let them go and return from Valmiki's Ashram as they knew only up to their marriage but Sita only allowed her male companion to fly away but female parrot died because of separation from her companion.

Ravana has come to her in the form of a mendicant and Sita tells him that he does not look like one.\n\nSome of her most prominent speeches are with Hanuman when he reaches Lanka.

After the swayamvara,  she accompanies her husband to his kingdom, but later chooses to accompany her husband, along with her brother-in-law [[Lakshmana]], in his exile. While in exile, the trio settles in the [[Dandaka]] forest from where she is abducted by [[Ravana]], the [[Rakshasa]] king of [[Lanka]]. She is imprisoned in [[Ashoka Vatika]] in Lanka until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. After the war, in some versions of the epic, Rama asks Sita to undergo Agni Pariksha (an [[Trial by ordeal#By fire|ordeal of fire]]) by which she proves her purity before she is accepted by Rama, which for the first time makes his brother Lakshmana get angry at him.\n\nIn some versions of the epic, the fire-god&nbsp;[[Agni]]&nbsp;creates [[Maya Sita]], who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. During the Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts say that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine&nbsp;[[Draupadi]]&nbsp;or the goddess&nbsp;[[Alamelu|Padmavati]]. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being&nbsp;[[Vedavati]], a woman Ravana tries to molest. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After proving her purity, Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen. After a few months, Sita becomes pregnant, to which a washerman makes insensitive comments on Sita to his wife, which Rama in disguise hears. Rama then sends Sita away on exile.

The Sita of the ''Ramayana'' may have been named after a more ancient [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic goddess]] Sita, who is mentioned once in the [[Rigveda]] as an earth goddess who blesses the land with good crops. In the [[Vedic period]], she was one of the goddesses associated with fertility.

According to this version, astrologers predict that first child of Vidyadhara Maya (Ravana's wife) will destroy his lineage. Thus, Ravana abandons her and orders the infant to be buried in a distant land where she is later discovered and adopted by Janaka.<ref name=\"Singaravelu 235\" />\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Rama breaking the bow to win Sita as wife.jpg|thumb|Rama breaks the bow to win Sita as wife.]]\nWhen Sita reaches adulthood, [[Janaka]] organizes a [[Swayamvara]] in [[Janakpurdham]] with the condition that Sita would marry only that person who would be able to string ''Pinaka'', the bow of the god [[Shiva]]. Janaka knew that the bow of Shiva was not even liftable, let alone stringable for ordinary mortals, and for selfish people it was not even approachable. Thus, Janaka tries to find the best husband for Sita.\n\nAt this time, [[Vishvamitra]] had brought Rama and his brother Lakshmana to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing about this ''swayamvara'', Vishvamitra asks Rama to participate in it and takes Rama and Lakshmana to the palace of Janaka in [[Janakpur]]. Janaka is greatly pleased to learn that Rama and Lakshmana are sons of Dasharatha. Next morning, in the middle of the hall, Rama lifts up the bow of Shiva with his left hand, fastens the string taut and breaks the bow in the process. However, another avatar of Vishnu, [[Parashurama]], became really angry as the bow of Shiva was broken. However, he does not realize that Rama is also an avatar of Vishnu, therefore after being informed of this, he apologizes for getting angry. Thus, Rama fulfills Janaka's condition to marry Sita. Later on [[Vivaha Panchami]], a marriage ceremony is conducted under the guidance of Satananda. Rama marries Sita, Bharata marries Mandavi, Lakshmana marries Urmila and Shatrughna marries Shrutakirti.<ref name=Parmeshwaranand />\n\n===Exile and abduction===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|Ravana cuts off Jatayu's wing while abducting Sita]]\nSome time after the wedding, [[Kaikeyi]], Rama's stepmother, compelled Dasharatha to make Bharata king, prompted by the coaxing of her maid [[Manthara]], and forced Rama to leave Ayodhya and spend a period of exile in the forests of [[Dandaka]] and later Panchavati. Sita and Lakshmana willingly renounced the comforts of the palace and joined Rama in exile. The Panchavati forest became the scene for Sita's abduction by Ravana, King of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita, disguising himself as a mendicant, while Rama was away fetching a [[Maricha|golden deer]] to please her. Some versions of the ''Ramayana'' describe Sita taking refuge with the fire-god [[Agni]], while [[Maya Sita]], her illusionary double, is kidnapped by the demon-king. [[Jatayu (Ramayana)|Jatayu]], the vulture-king, tried to protect Sita but Ravana chopped off his wings.

During her captivity for a year in Lanka, Ravana expressed his desire for her; however, Sita refused his advances and struggled to maintain her chastity. [[Hanuman]] was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeded in discovering Sita's whereabouts. Sita gave Hanuman her jewellery and asked him to give it to her husband. Hanuman returned across the sea to Rama.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/>\n\nSita was finally rescued by Rama, who waged a war to defeat Ravana. Upon rescue, Rama makes Sita undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. In some versions of ''Ramayana'', during this test the fire-god Agni appears in front of Rama and attests to Sita's purity, or hands over to him the real Sita and declares it was Maya Sita who was abducted by Ravana.<ref name=\"Mani720\"/> The Thai version of the Ramayana, however, tells of Sita walking on the fire, of her own accord, to feel clean, as opposed to jumping in it. She is not burnt, and the coals turn to lotuses.After proving that Sita is still pure, she returns to Ayodhya. But the citizens of Ayodhaya don't accept Sita and says that she is impure, and ram has to forcefully sent Sita against his wish. After 12 yrs he go backs to Sita and asks her to come back to Ayodhya. But Sita denies and says bhumi to take her inside herself.. Sita goes inside the earth and gives her sons to Rama....\n\n=The life of Sita, after exiling again and the reason of exiling according to mythology=\nThe couple came back to Ayodhya, where Rama was crowned king with Sita by his side.\n\nWhile Rama's trust and affection for Sita never wavered, it soon became evident that some people in Ayodhya could not accept Sita's long captivity under Ravana. During Rama's period of rule, an intemperate [[Dhobi|washerman]], while berating his wayward wife, declared that he was \"no pusillanimous Rama who would take his wife back after she had lived in the house of another man\". This statement was reported back to Rama, who knew that the accusation against Sita was baseless. Nevertheless, he would not let [[slander]] undermine his rule, so he sent Sita away.\n\nThus Sita was forced into exile a second time. Sita, who was pregnant, was given refuge in the hermitage of [[Valmiki]], where she delivered twin sons named [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] and [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]].<ref name=Parmeshwaranand /> In the hermitage, Sita raised her sons alone, as a single mother.<ref name=\"Contemporary Influence of Sita by\">{{cite web|last=Bhargava|first=Anju P.|title=Contemporary Influence of Sita by|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|publisher=The Infinity Foundation|accessdate=31 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713001426/http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITsitaframeset.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They grew up to be valiant and intelligent and were eventually united with their father.

The first time is in the town of [[Chitrakoot Dham (Karwi)|Chitrakuta]] where she narrates an ancient story to Rama, whereby Rama promises to Sita that he will never kill anybody without provocation.\n\nThe second time Sita is shown talking prominently is when she speaks to Ravana. Ravana has come to her in the form of a mendicant and Sita tells him that he does not look like one.\n\nSome of her most prominent speeches are with Hanuman when he reaches Lanka. Hanuman wants an immediate union of Rama and Sita and thus he proposes to Sita to ride on his back. Sita refuses as she does not want to run away like a thief; instead she wants her husband Rama to come and defeat Ravana to save her.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Valmiki |first1=Ramayana |title=Sundarkanda, sarga 37 |url=https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=5&language=dv&field_sarga_value=37 |website=www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in |publisher=IIT Kanpur}}</ref>\n\n==Jain version==\n{{main|Rama in Jainism}}\n[[File:Hanuman before Rama.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rama seated with Sita, fanned by [[Lakshmana]], while [[Hanuman]] pays his respects]]\nSita is said to be the daughter of [[Ravana]]'s queen [[Mandodari]]. It was predicted that the first child of Mandodari would bring annihilation to the family. Hence, Ravana deserted the child when she was born. The minister who was responsible for this took her in a pearl-box, placed her near a plough and told King [[Janaka]] of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] that the girl had been born from the furrow. Janaka's queen Sunaina became Sita's foster mother.\n\nThere is also a narration about Sita's brother Bhamandala. He did not know that Sita was his sister and wanted to marry her. He even wanted to abduct her. This story ends when Bhamandala, after learning that Sita is his sister, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain ascetic]].\n\n==Symbolism==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Hermitage of Valmiki, Folio from the \"Nadaun\" Ramayana (Adventures of Rama) LACMA AC1999.127.45.jpg|thumb|250px|Sita in the [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] of Valmiki]]\nA female deity of agricultural fertility by the name Sita was known before Valmiki's ''Ramayana'', but was overshadowed by better-known goddesses associated with fertility. According to ''Ramayana'', Sita was discovered in a furrow when Janaka was ploughing. Since Janaka was a king, it is likely that ploughing was part of a royal ritual to ensure fertility of the land. Sita is considered to be a child of Mother Earth, produced by union between the king and the land. Sita is a personification of Earth's fertility, abundance, and well-being.\n\n==Swami Vivekananda on Sita==\n[[File:Valmiki train Lava Kushas in Art of Archery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Valmiki training Lava Kusha (sons of Rama & Sita) in the art of archery.]]\n[[Swami Vivekananda]] states that Rama is considered the type of the Absolute and Sita that of Power.

Swami Vivekananda assured that if world literature of the past and world literature of the future were thoroughly exhausted, yet, it would not be possible to find another Sita, because Sita is unique; the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.\n\nVivekananda said:\n\n{{Quote|All our mythology may vanish, even our Vedas may depart and our Sanskrit language may vanish forever, but so long as there will be five Hindus living here, even if only seeking the most vulgar patois, there will be the story of Sita present.}}\n\nSita was a true Indian by nature, Vivekananda concluded, who never returned injury.<ref>The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Lectures and Discourses/The Ramayana</ref>\n\n==Portrayal==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Srisita ram laxman hanuman manor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Deities Sita (far right), Rama (center), Lakshmana (far left) and Hanuman (below, seated) at [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]], [[Watford]], England]]\nHindu tradition reveres Sita.

[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts.

[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts.

The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches shared the same plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same centre line as the engine [[crankshaft]]; when viewed head-on along the length of the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.\n\nThe second implementation uses two single-plate dry clutches \u2013 side-by-side from the perpendicular view, but again sharing the centre line of the crankshaft.\n\nA later variation uses two separate but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along the length of the input shaft and crankshaft centre line), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly.

Audi originally used the direct-shift gearbox name, but now uses the name \"S tronic\" for its DCTs.<ref name=Eureka/>\n\nThe first ever series production DCT was the Volkswagen Group DQ250<ref name=DCTfactsVWAG/> six-speed dual-clutch transmission,<ref name=VMS/> with dual concentric wet multiplate clutches.<ref name=VMS/> It was produced at the Group's [[Kassel]] [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|plant]]<ref name=AMS/><ref name=AEI/> under exclusive license from BorgWarner<ref name=Eureka/><ref name=AutoChannel/> for use in transverse [[powertrain]] installations, of either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) layouts.<ref name=VMS/> The 4WD versions are fundamentally identical to the FWD versions, but the 4WD versions use an additional bolt-on power take-off unit to direct engine torque to the [[Haldex Traction]] rear axle. This DQ250 variant is used in a wide range of models: Volkswagen Passenger Cars ([[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf/Rabbit/Golf Plus]], Scirocco, [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]], [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], and [[Volkswagen Touran|Touran]]); Audi cars ([[Audi A3|A3]], and [[Audi TT|TT]]); SEAT cars ([[SEAT Ibiza|Ibiza]], [[SEAT Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[SEAT Altea|Altea]], and [[SEAT Toledo|Toledo]]); \u0160koda cars ([[\u0160koda Octavia|Octavia]] and [[\u0160koda Superb|Superb]]); and Volkswagen commercial vehicles ([[Volkswagen Caddy|Caddy]] and [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|T5 Transporter]]).\n\nA second variant of the DSG went into series production in 2008<ref name=VWAG7/>\u2014the DQ200.

The name of the transmission is 7-speed LDF Dual Clutch \"Doppia Frizione\" with shift characteristics variable via Drive Select Mode and all-wheel drive with electrohydraulic multiplate clutch.\n\nThe car has three modes changed using the steering-wheel-mounted \"ANIMA\" or mode selector. The three modes are strada, sport, and corsa, each with faster shifts. Launch control raises the rotation speed to 4200 rpm before dropping the clutch. The Hurac\u00e1n upshifts automatically at redline, but not before running into the limiter for a fraction of a second. Using the paddles to call for earlier shifts knocks 0.1 to 0.2 sec off the figures.\n\n===Kia===\n[[Kia Motors]] has announced the application of the all-new seven-speed DCT to a production model for the first time, the new Kia Cee\u2019d GT Line, which made its global debut at the 85th Salon International de l\u2019Automobile in Geneva on 3 March 2015.\n\nCompared to the six-speed DCT currently used in the European-market [[Cee'd]] models, the new transmission is expected to deliver a fuel-economy improvement of 7% and a 5% improvement in 0\u201362&nbsp; mph acceleration times. Like most new DCTs, the new transmission features dual dry clutches and two input shafts, allowing for seamless torque delivery between shifts, as well as gear-jumping to the optimal ratio, should the driver ask for it. If that was to apply to the current [[Kia Forte|Forte]] K3 Koup or Pro[[Cee'd GT]] and [[GT line]], with its 204-hp/265&nbsp; nm 1.6L inline-four [[Gamma II]] T-GDI Turbo engine and also 133-ps/300&nbsp; nm 1.6L [[CRDi]] diesel engine, for example, that would raise its fuel economy from 24 mpg city/36 highway to about 26/39 while bringing its 7.4-second 0\u201360 run to about 7.0 seconds.\n\nThe new transmission is the first of its type from the brand and has been developed in-house by Kia's research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D center. More fuel-efficient than Kia's existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode.\n\nInnovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with an electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.\n\nThe hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kick down or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times.\n\nThe continuous power delivery of the DCT minimizes the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission's boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee\u2019d GT line.\n\nCombined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT's seven gears allow the GT Line's diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine's torque increased from 265 to 285 nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine's improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy.\n\nReduction of noise, vibration, and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT's development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.\nAfter the Cee\u2019d GT Line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.\n\n===BMW===\nIn January 2008, [[BMW]] introduced a dual-clutch transmission for their [[BMW M3|M3]] model, manufactured by [[Getrag]], embedding a DualTronic dual-clutch module from BorgWarner, and dubbed \"M double-clutch transmission\" (M DCT).

The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches shared the same plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same centre line as the engine [[crankshaft]]; when viewed head-on along the length of the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.\n\nThe second implementation uses two single-plate dry clutches \u2013 side-by-side from the perpendicular view, but again sharing the centre line of the crankshaft.\n\nA later variation uses two separate but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along the length of the input shaft and crankshaft centre line), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly. This latter clutch arrangement (unlike the other two variations) is driven by a gear from the engine crankshaft.\n\n==Suppliers==\n\n===BorgWarner===\n[[BorgWarner|BorgWarner Inc.]] supplies<ref name=AutoChannel/> wet dual clutches<ref name=AEI/> and electrohydraulic control modules ([[mechatronics]])<ref name=AMS/><ref name=AutoChannel/> for these dual-clutch transmissions, along with complete dual-clutch transmission and [[transaxle]] assemblies.

The name of the transmission is 7-speed LDF Dual Clutch \"Doppia Frizione\" with shift characteristics variable via Drive Select Mode and all-wheel drive with electrohydraulic multiplate clutch.\n\nThe car has three modes changed using the steering-wheel-mounted \"ANIMA\" or mode selector. The three modes are strada, sport, and corsa, each with faster shifts. Launch control raises the rotation speed to 4200 rpm before dropping the clutch. The Hurac\u00e1n upshifts automatically at redline, but not before running into the limiter for a fraction of a second. Using the paddles to call for earlier shifts knocks 0.1 to 0.2 sec off the figures.\n\n===Kia===\n[[Kia Motors]] has announced the application of the all-new seven-speed DCT to a production model for the first time, the new Kia Cee\u2019d GT Line, which made its global debut at the 85th Salon International de l\u2019Automobile in Geneva on 3 March 2015.\n\nCompared to the six-speed DCT currently used in the European-market [[Cee'd]] models, the new transmission is expected to deliver a fuel-economy improvement of 7% and a 5% improvement in 0\u201362&nbsp; mph acceleration times. Like most new DCTs, the new transmission features dual dry clutches and two input shafts, allowing for seamless torque delivery between shifts, as well as gear-jumping to the optimal ratio, should the driver ask for it. If that was to apply to the current [[Kia Forte|Forte]] K3 Koup or Pro[[Cee'd GT]] and [[GT line]], with its 204-hp/265&nbsp; nm 1.6L inline-four [[Gamma II]] T-GDI Turbo engine and also 133-ps/300&nbsp; nm 1.6L [[CRDi]] diesel engine, for example, that would raise its fuel economy from 24 mpg city/36 highway to about 26/39 while bringing its 7.4-second 0\u201360 run to about 7.0 seconds.\n\nThe new transmission is the first of its type from the brand and has been developed in-house by Kia's research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D center. More fuel-efficient than Kia's existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode.\n\nInnovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with an electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.\n\nThe hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kick down or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times.\n\nThe continuous power delivery of the DCT minimizes the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission's boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee\u2019d GT line.\n\nCombined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT's seven gears allow the GT Line's diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine's torque increased from 265 to 285 nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine's improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy.\n\nReduction of noise, vibration, and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT's development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.\nAfter the Cee\u2019d GT Line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.\n\n===BMW===\nIn January 2008, [[BMW]] introduced a dual-clutch transmission for their [[BMW M3|M3]] model, manufactured by [[Getrag]], embedding a DualTronic dual-clutch module from BorgWarner, and dubbed \"M double-clutch transmission\" (M DCT).

The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no [[Synchromesh|synchronizing mechanism]] is needed. After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for [[Switcher|shunting locomotives]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dual Clutch Transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n", "name_user": "Davism0703", "label": "safe", "comment": "AMT.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-clutch_transmission"}
