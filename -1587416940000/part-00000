The NCAA did not immediately record assists throughout women's college basketball when it began sponsoring women's sports in the 1981\u201382 school year; it began recording assists in Division I in 1985\u201386.\n\nThe all-time leader in career assists is [[Suzie McConnell-Serio|Suzie McConnell]] of [[Penn State Lady Lions basketball|Penn State]]. She recorded 1,307&nbsp;assists in 128&nbsp;games (10.21 per game average) between 1984\u201385 and 1987\u201388. Second on the list is [[Andrea Nagy]] of [[FIU Panthers women's basketball|FIU]], who compiled 1,165&nbsp;assists. Only three other women have recorded 1,000 career assists at the Division&nbsp;I level: [[Courtney Vandersloot]] of [[Gonzaga Bulldogs women's basketball|Gonzaga]] (1,118), [[Sabrina Ionescu]] of [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]] (1,091), and Tine Freil of [[Pacific Tigers women's basketball|Pacific]] (1,088).\n\nAll but one of the players listed compiled their totals in the standard four seasons. The exception is Neacole Hall of [[Alabama State Lady Hornets basketball|Alabama State]], who compiled 869 assists despite playing only three seasons in Division I (1986\u201387 to 1988\u201389). Hall is also the all-time Division I leader in assists per game with 10.35, slightly ahead of McConnell's 10.21.<ref name=Average>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_basketball_RB/2020/D1.pdf |title=Career Records: Assist Average |work=2019\u201320 Division I Women's Basketball Records |publisher=NCAA |page=17 |accessdate=December 13, 2019}}</ref> In all, 16 of the top 25 players in career assists are also in the top 25 for assists per game.<ref name=Average/>{{efn|The career leaderboards for total assists and assists average in the 2019\u201320 Division I record book have 15 names in common.

highest assists totals in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division&nbsp;I]] women's basketball history are listed below. The NCAA did not immediately record assists throughout women's college basketball when it began sponsoring women's sports in the 1981\u201382 school year; it began recording assists in Division I in 1985\u201386.\n\nThe all-time leader in career assists is [[Suzie McConnell-Serio|Suzie McConnell]] of [[Penn State Lady Lions basketball|Penn State]]. She recorded 1,307&nbsp;assists in 128&nbsp;games (10.21 per game average) between 1984\u201385 and 1987\u201388. Second on the list is [[Andrea Nagy]] of [[FIU Panthers women's basketball|FIU]], who compiled 1,165&nbsp;assists. Only three other women have recorded 1,000 career assists at the Division&nbsp;I level: [[Courtney Vandersloot]] of [[Gonzaga Bulldogs women's basketball|Gonzaga]] (1,118), [[Sabrina Ionescu]] of [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]] (1,091), and Tine Freil of [[Pacific Tigers women's basketball|Pacific]] (1,088).\n\nAll but one of the players listed compiled their totals in the standard four seasons. The exception is Neacole Hall of [[Alabama State Lady Hornets basketball|Alabama State]], who compiled 869 assists despite playing only three seasons in Division I (1986\u201387 to 1988\u201389). Hall is also the all-time Division I leader in assists per game with 10.35, slightly ahead of McConnell's 10.21.<ref name=Average>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_basketball_RB/2020/D1.pdf |title=Career Records: Assist Average |work=2019\u201320 Division I Women's Basketball Records |publisher=NCAA |page=17 |accessdate=December 13, 2019}}</ref> In all, 16 of the top 25 players in career assists are also in the top 25 for assists per game.<ref name=Average/>{{efn|The career leaderboards for total assists and assists average in the 2019\u201320 Division I record book have 15 names in common.

Grande is also the only individual in the top 25 to have played at more than one school; she played three years at [[Ball State Cardinals women's basketball|Ball State]] before transferring to Ohio State for her final season.\n\n==Key==\n{{col-start}}{{col-break|width=50%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Pos.'''||G||F||C||'''Ref.'''\n|-\n|[[Basketball position|Position]]||[[Basketball position|Guard]]||[[Basketball position|Forward]]||[[Basketball position|Center]]||References\n|-\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<!-- |-\n|style=\"background-color:#cfecec; width:6em\"|^\n|Player still competing in NCAA Division I -->\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ff9; width:6em\"|*\n|Elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]\n|-\n|Team (X)\n|{{nowrap|Denotes the number of times a player from that team is represented on this list}}\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Top 25 career assists leaders==\n[[File:Andreanagy.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Andrea Nagy]] is second on the all-time list with 1,165&nbsp;assists.]]\n[[File:Courtney Vandersloot.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Courtney Vandersloot]] compiled 1,118&nbsp;assists, the third-most all-time.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Player\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Pos.\n!Team\n!Career start{{efn|Reflects the calendar year in which the player's Division I career began.

Senators of previous eras have represented different geographic areas.\n\nThe district was created after the 1850 census and reapportionment and was drawn for [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago County]], in central Wisconsin.  The inaugural holder was [[Coles Bashford]] in the 6th session of the Wisconsin Legislature, 1853. \n\nIn the 19th century, the district included at various times [[Marathon County, Wisconsin|Marathon]], [[Oconto County, Wisconsin|Oconto]], [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano]] and [[Waupaca County, Wisconsin|Waupaca]] counties, and was located within the now-defunct [[Wisconsin's 9th congressional district|9th Congressional District]]\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the district covered the city of [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and Racine County, in southeastern Wisconsin, within the boundaries of the [[Wisconsin's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]].\n\nIn redistricting after the 2010 census, the city of Racine was mostly removed and rural and suburban portions of Kenosha County were added to the district, turning the 21st into a safe Republican seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-the-gop-rigs-elections-121907/ |title= How the GOP Rigs Elections |publisher= [[Rolling Stone]] |last= Berman |first= Ari |date=2018-01-24 |accessdate= 2019-02-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Recalls==\nThe 21st Senate district is unique in [[Recall elections in Wisconsin|Wisconsin recall history]].  In 1996, it became the first district in which a Wisconsin state legislator was successfully removed from office via recall election, when [[Kimberly Plache]] defeated [[George Petak]]. With the recall of [[Van H.

Then 19 years old and living in [[Vallauris|Vallauris, France]], Corbett would accompany her artist boyfriend as he delivered chairs made of metal, wood and rope. One of those deliveries was to Picasso, who was struck by her high ponytail and long neck. \"He made many portraits of her. At the time, most people thought he was drawing the actress [[Brigitte Bardot]]. But in fact, he was inspired by [Corbett],\" Picasso's grandson Olivier Widmaier Picasso told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' in 2004.\n\n\"I think the Chicago Sculpture was inspired by her,\" said the grandson, author of ''Picasso, the Real Family Story''. Picasso made 40 works inspired by her, said the grandson, including ''The Girl Who Said No'', reflecting their [[platonic relationship]]. The quality of the Picasso sculpture inspired other artists such as [[Alexander Calder]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Henry Moore]].\n[[File:Arabian Hound 001 U.jpg|thumb|An Afghan Hound dog]]\nThis sculpture is also seen as an abstract replica of an [[Afghan Hound|Afghan Hound dog]]. Picasso had a Dachshund dog, [[Lump (dog)|Lump]], which was the former companion to an Afghan Hound dog owned by Picasso's friend [[David Douglas Duncan]]. In the 1970s Jacqueline Picasso explained to Neil Thomas, an Australian lady, it was simply a male baboon viewed from head-on. \"Picasso loved the way the creature changed as you viewed it from different angles\"; it was part of a continuation of his lifelong inspiration from Africa.\n\nThere was an ongoing dialogue between Picasso's sculpture and his painting.<ref>Wilson, Simon (1994) ''Picasso: Sculptor/Painter, A Brief Guide'', London: Tate Gallery.</ref> A further possible influence could lie in his portraits of Jacqueline herself, made in the early 1960s, specifically ''Bust of a Woman (Jacqueline)'' from May 1962 (Zervos XX, 243, Private Collection).<ref>Rubin, William (ed) (1996) ''[https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_283_300063159.pdf Picasso and portraiture: representation and transformation]'', New York: Museum of Modern Art, plate, p.475.</ref>\n\n==Local and pop culture==\n[[Image:ChristkindlmarketChicago.jpg|thumb|Chicago Picasso as seen at [[Christkindlmarkt]]]]\nThe Picasso was the site of an August 23, 1968 press conference in which [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Phil Ochs]], and others were arrested after nominating a pig \u2014 [[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] \u2014 for president of the United States.

Daley Center. It can also be seen briefly in the 1993 film ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', as [[Harrison Ford]], playing [[Richard Kimble]], and his pursuers run across the plaza, and in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' as people in and under a reviewing stand dance to a song sung by [[Matthew Broderick]], who plays Bueller. The sculpture also makes an appearance in the 1988 film ''[[Switching Channels]]'' starring Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve.\n\nToday, the Chicago Picasso has become a well-known meeting spot for Chicagoans. Depending on the season and time of the month, there are musical performances, farmers' markets, a  [[Christkindlmarkt]], and other Chicago affairs which are held around the Picasso statue in front of Daley Plaza.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of public art in Chicago]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n*Herrmann, Andrew, \"The Woman Who Inspired City's Picasso\", ''Chicago Sun-Times'' (Nov. 11, 2004)\n*Artner, Alan G., \"[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-picasso-story,0,1344585.story Chicago's Picasso sculpture: The unveiling of the puzzling sculpture changes the public art landscape]\".

Then 19 years old and living in [[Vallauris|Vallauris, France]], Corbett would accompany her artist boyfriend as he delivered chairs made of metal, wood and rope. One of those deliveries was to Picasso, who was struck by her high ponytail and long neck. \"He made many portraits of her. At the time, most people thought he was drawing the actress [[Brigitte Bardot]]. But in fact, he was inspired by [Corbett],\" Picasso's grandson Olivier Widmaier Picasso told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' in 2004.\n\n\"I think the Chicago Sculpture was inspired by her,\" said the grandson, author of ''Picasso, the Real Family Story''. Picasso made 40 works inspired by her, said the grandson, including ''The Girl Who Said No'', reflecting their [[platonic relationship]]. The quality of the Picasso sculpture inspired other artists such as [[Alexander Calder]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Henry Moore]].\n[[File:Arabian Hound 001 U.jpg|thumb|An Afghan Hound dog]]\nThis sculpture is also seen as an abstract replica of an [[Afghan Hound|Afghan Hound dog]]. Picasso had a Dachshund dog, [[Lump (dog)|Lump]], which was the former companion to an Afghan Hound dog owned by Picasso's friend [[David Douglas Duncan]]. In the 1970s Jacqueline Picasso explained to Neil Thomas, an Australian lady, it was simply a male baboon viewed from head-on. \"Picasso loved the way the creature changed as you viewed it from different angles\"; it was part of a continuation of his lifelong inspiration from Africa.\n\nThere was an ongoing dialogue between Picasso's sculpture and his painting.<ref>Wilson, Simon (1994) ''Picasso: Sculptor/Painter, A Brief Guide'', London: Tate Gallery.</ref> A further possible influence could lie in his portraits of Jacqueline herself, made in the early 1960s, specifically ''Bust of a Woman (Jacqueline)'' from May 1962 (Zervos XX, 243, Private Collection).<ref>Rubin, William (ed) (1996) ''[https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_283_300063159.pdf Picasso and portraiture: representation and transformation]'', New York: Museum of Modern Art, plate, p.475.</ref>\n\n==Local and pop culture==\n[[Image:ChristkindlmarketChicago.jpg|thumb|Chicago Picasso as seen at [[Christkindlmarkt]]]]\nThe Picasso was the site of an August 23, 1968 press conference in which [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Phil Ochs]], and others were arrested after nominating a pig \u2014 [[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] \u2014 for president of the United States.

It can also be seen briefly in the 1993 film ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', as [[Harrison Ford]], playing [[Richard Kimble]], and his pursuers run across the plaza, and in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' as people in and under a reviewing stand dance to a song sung by [[Matthew Broderick]], who plays Bueller. The sculpture also makes an appearance in the 1988 film ''[[Switching Channels]]'' starring Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve.\n\nToday, the Chicago Picasso has become a well-known meeting spot for Chicagoans. Depending on the season and time of the month, there are musical performances, farmers' markets, a  [[Christkindlmarkt]], and other Chicago affairs which are held around the Picasso statue in front of Daley Plaza.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of public art in Chicago]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n*Herrmann, Andrew, \"The Woman Who Inspired City's Picasso\", ''Chicago Sun-Times'' (Nov. 11, 2004)\n*Artner, Alan G., \"[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-picasso-story,0,1344585.story Chicago's Picasso sculpture: The unveiling of the puzzling sculpture changes the public art landscape]\".

The feces contain traces of [[hepatitis A]] only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food.\n\nAnother recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between [[oral sex]] and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]].

Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are [[microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.\n\n==As punishment==\nForced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners.

{"title_page": "Old Iron Bridge, Merthyr Tydfil", "text_new": "The '''Old Iron Bridge''' of 1800, originally known simply as '''Merthyr Bridge''' before 1809,<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /> in [[:en:Merthyr Tydfil|Merthyr Tydfil]], [[South Wales]], was a [[cast-iron]] bridge across the [[:en:River Taff|River Taff]].<ref name=\"Davies, 1978\" />\n\nAlthough an important early example of iron bridge-building and well known as a local landmark within living memory,<ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> the bridge has largely disappeared from engineering history.\n\n== Early iron bridges ==\n\n[[:en:The Iron Bridge|The Iron Bridge]] across the [[River Severn|Severn]] near [[Coalbrookdale]] opened in 1781 and is generally regarded as the world's first cast-iron bridge.<ref name=\"Cossons & Trinder, IB\" /> It had little immediate influence on bridge design and few other important iron bridges were built as a result.{{efn-lr|[[Wearmouth Bridge]] in [[Sunderland]] was the only one of note.}} However a flood in 1795 washed away many bridges on the Severn, but the Iron Bridge survived. This survival had more influence on bridge design, as did the completion of [[Wearmouth Bridge]] the following year.<ref name=\"Cossons & Trinder, IB\" /> Cast iron was now established as a viable material for bridges and a number were produced in the years immediately afterwards.{{efn-lr|[[Thomas Telford]]'s [[Buildwas Bridge]] and [[Coalport Bridge]], just downstream from Iron Bridge, being two significant ones.}}\n\n== Earlier bridges in Merthyr ==\n[[File:Jackson's Bridge, Merthyr Tydfil.jpg|thumb|Jackson's Bridge, still standing and now the oldest surviving bridge in Merthyr Tydfil]]\n[[:en:Richard Crawshay|Richard Crawshay]]'s [[:en:Cyfarthfa Ironworks|Cyfarthfa Ironworks]] was on the West bank of the River Taff, the opposite side from the centre of the developing town.\n\nThe previous stone bridge had collapsed in the winter of 1798\u201399.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=92}} This left the only bridge across the Taff as Jackson's Bridge,<ref >{{Coord|51.7491|-3.384|region:GB}}</ref><ref name=\"BLB, Jackson's Bridge\" /> which had been built in 1793 by the [[:en:Dowlais Iron Company|Dowlais Iron Company]].<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /> This was an inconvenience to the inhabitants of Merthyr, many of whom now worked for the Cyfartha ironworks, who needed to cross the river to get to the works. Rivalry between the ironmasters was also intense and it was a matter of prestige for Cyfartha workers to not be dependent upon another company's bridge.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=92}}\n\nSmall iron bridges already existed at Merthyr, crossing the [[Glamorganshire Canal]]. This was a far smaller watercourse than the Taff and only needed a simple single-panel bridge. One of these still survives, although now only kept as a monument in a park.{{efn-lr|See [[:File:Iron canal bridge from Rhydycar.jpg|Iron canal bridge from Rhydycar]]}}<ref name=\"AM, Rhydycar Canal Bridge\" /><ref >{{Coord|51.7504|-3.3857|region:GB}}</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n\nRichard Crawshay commissioned a new bridge and had [[Watkin George]], his principal engineer at Cyfartha and who had also designed the nearby [[Pont-y-Cafnau]] in 1792,<ref name=\"ET, Watkin\" /> design it. The bridge was built in 1799 and opened at the end of April 1800.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=93}}\n\nThe river needed a span of around {{cvt|70|ft}}, which was too much to have been cast in one piece, or then installed, with the equipment of the time. Although structurally an [[arch bridge]], the bridge was cast in three sections, each almost straight. The outer panels were straight, the centre had a rise of {{cvt|4|in}} in its {{cvt|26|ft}} length.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93, 94-95}} The sides of the bridge were cast as three rectangular panels, including their [[balustrade]]. The ends of the arch were supported on triangular cantilever brackets, cast in two sections. The abutments of the bridge were stone, [[batter (walls)|batter]]ed back with sloping faces so that they met the ends of the arch panels perpendicularly. Where the iron castings abutted against each other was packed with oak planks, two or three inches thick and the width of the iron parts. These were [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]]ed through and clamped. The intention was to give the iron structure some degree of flexibility, as otherwise it would be too brittle.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93, 94-95}} However the short life of the timber gave trouble twenty years later and the bridge required extensive repairs.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=96}}\n\nThe balustrade of the bridge did not form a structural part of it, although it was cast in situ with the main panels.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93, 94-95}}  There were three perpendicular uprights to each panel, with strips forming a pair of intertwined waves between them, giving an 'X' shape in each of the four spaces. These were cast integrally, but had the appearance of [[wrought ironwork]]. Three horizontal strips of wrought iron were riveted to the back, to make the gaps in the balustrade smaller,<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /> and these appear to have been added later.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93}} Its [[parapet#Bridge parapets|parapet]] also included 'heart-shaped' motifs at the centre of the bridge,{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93}} distinctive to the work of Watkin George.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"Rowson\" />\n\nThe deck of the bridge was formed of cast iron crossbeams. These were an inverted T in section, six inches on each arm and &frac34;\" in section thickness. With a length of twelve feet, they gave a useful carriageway {{cvt|10.5|ft}} wide.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=95}} These crossbeams may have been added in the extensive 1817 repairs.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=96}} The surface of the bridge was formed of stone [[sett (paving)|sett]]s or [[cobblestone|cobble]]s, but these gave a poor surface for walking as they were uneven between the gaps and slippery in rain. In later years the surface was dressed smooth with a layer of the abundant ironworks slag.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" />\n\nThe iron sections are thought to have been [[sand casting|cast]] in open-backed single-sided sand moulds, as one surface shows evidence of surface bubbles.{{efn-lr|More advanced casting techniques would use an enclosed mould, and with the surface restricted to a small [[runner (casting)|runner]] and [[riser (casting)|riser]], which would be cut off afterwards.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" />}}\n\n== Repairs ==\nA series of inspections and repairs were made to the bridge, at two year intervals, from 1801 to 1809. Most of these were to the stonework of the bridge abutments or the stone retaining walls of the riverbank, particularly for improvements to reduce the effects of flooding. The 1809 report on its condition was the first time the name 'Iron Bridge' was recorded.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=95-96}}\n\n=== 1817 repairs ===\nIn 1817, major repairs were made to the ironwork of the bridge itself. [[:en:William Williams (Cyfarthfa)|William Williams]], Watkin George's successor as chief engineer of the ironworks, made a report on its condition and recommended that an iron decking of flat plates should be applied over the existing structure, then a pavement of stone or iron treads be applied over that. The work carried out is not known, but the costs of it exceeded those that would be expected for a mere re-surfacing. The total cost \u00a3354&nbsp;1s&nbsp;10&frac12;d, with \u00a3196&nbsp;11s&nbsp;6d paid for castings and \u00a3147&nbsp;0s&nbsp;2&frac12;d for labour. Williams was paid 10&nbsp;[[guinea (coin)|guinea]]s for his involvement.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=96}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the cross girders directly beneath the surface of the bridge had been installed during the 1817 repairs, their cost explaining the large sum of paid for castings.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" />\n\n1816 and 1817 were boom years for the building of iron bridges in Britain and many surviving bridges date from this period.{{efn-lr|The [[Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow|Wye Bridge, Chepstow]], being a typical example.}} [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] had ended land warfare in Europe but this led to widespread economic and civil disruption.<ref name=\"Gash, 1978\" /> Despite this, ironmasters sought markets for their increasing capacity and to recover the lost markets for military ordnance. Roadbuilding and bridge projects could stimulate a local economy and trade, whilst also providing employment to the demobilised soldiers.\n\n=== 1852 repairs ===\nThe 1852 report was carried out Henry Wren, Superintendent of the local Board of Health. He found that the bridge was significantly decayed, particularly the timber packing between the castings. He went so far as to suggest that the bridge was both unsafe in its current state and that it was beyond economic repair, largely due to the need to dismantle it almost completely. He suggested instead that the first consideration be given to a replacement, and that this replacement should be in the location of the later Ynysgau Bridge.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=96-97}} Such a bridge could be wider, better suited to vehicles, and would be aligned with the two main roads on each side of the river.\n\nHowever a committee of three was tasked with deciding on what to do with the bridge and they chose instead to repair it. The cost was \u00a366&nbsp;12s&nbsp;6&frac12;d, more than half of which was for timberwork.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=96-97}}\n\n=== 1860 report ===\nBy 1860, after a long delay, the Board of Health decided to seriously consider replacement and began with a traffic survey of the current bridge. For a week in June-July, daily traffic from 8am to 8pm was counted:{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=97-98}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| \n!

In 1872, a young girl lost both her legs after being run down by a cart.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=99}}\n\n=== Ynsygau Bridge ===\nIn March 1880, a new and larger bridge, the Ynysgau Bridge, also called the New Iron Bridge, was eventually opened next to the old bridge.<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> \n\nThe [[:en:Ynysgau Chapel, Merthyr Tydfil|Ynysgau Chapel]]{{efn-lr|Welsh: \"Amongst them\"}} had been built in 1749 on the East bank of the Taff, adjacent to where the first bridge would be built. The Old Bridge has sometimes been referred to as the Ynysgau Bridge,<ref name=\"ET, Watkin\" /> but this is a modern anachronism, after both had been demolished, and the name belongs to the later bridge.<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, Ynysgau\" />\n\nThe original bridge crossed the river perpendicularly, so as to be the shortest span. The new bridge was on a skew, giving a straighter alignment between Penry Street on the West and into Victoria Street.<ref name=\"NLS\" />{{efn-lr|As the name suggests, Victoria Street post-dated the original bridge.}} This required a longer bridge, and it was also widened to be more easily capable of carrying vehicle traffic.\n\nThis bridge was made of [[wrought iron]] as a [[:en:lattice truss|lattice truss]] structure.<ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> This allowed it to have a flat and horizontal deck all the way across.\n\n=== Removal ===\nThe bridge remained in use until WWII, although as just a footbridge with bollards to prevent vehicles, after which the ends were fenced off, pending its demolition.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=99}} However, once again, the bridge's demise was postponed and it remained in use through the 1950s.<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" />\n\nIn the late 1950s, concern at protecting the town from the river's near annual floods,<ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> and the increasing number of motor vehicles, led to a widespread scheme to widen the river and canalise it between robust banks.

This survival had more influence on bridge design, as did the completion of [[Wearmouth Bridge]] the following year.<ref name=\"Cossons & Trinder, IB\" /> Cast iron was now established as a viable material for bridges and a number were produced in the years immediately afterwards.{{efn-lr|[[Thomas Telford]]'s [[Buildwas Bridge]] and [[Coalport Bridge]], just downstream from Iron Bridge, being two significant ones.}}\n\n== Earlier bridges in Merthyr ==\n[[File:Jackson's Bridge, Merthyr Tydfil.jpg|thumb|Jackson's Bridge, still standing and now the oldest surviving bridge in Merthyr Tydfil]]\n[[:en:Richard Crawshay|Richard Crawshay]]'s [[:en:Cyfarthfa Ironworks|Cyfarthfa Ironworks]] was on the West bank of the River Taff, the opposite side from the centre of the developing town.\n\nThe previous stone bridge had collapsed in the winter of 1798\u201399.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=92}} This left the only bridge across the Taff as Jackson's Bridge,<ref >{{Coord|51.7491|-3.384|region:GB}}</ref><ref name=\"BLB, Jackson's Bridge\" /> which had been built in 1793 by the [[:en:Dowlais Iron Company|Dowlais Iron Company]].<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /> This was an inconvenience to the inhabitants of Merthyr, many of whom now worked for the Cyfartha ironworks, who needed to cross the river to get to the works. Rivalry between the ironmasters was also intense and it was a matter of prestige for Cyfartha workers to not be dependent upon another company's bridge.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=92}}\n\nSmall iron bridges already existed at Merthyr, crossing the [[Glamorganshire Canal]]. This was a far smaller watercourse than the Taff and only needed a simple single-panel bridge. One of these still survives, although now only kept as a monument in a park.{{efn-lr|See [[:File:Iron canal bridge from Rhydycar.jpg|Iron canal bridge from Rhydycar]]}}<ref name=\"AM, Rhydycar Canal Bridge\" /><ref >{{Coord|51.7504|-3.3857|region:GB}}</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n\nRichard Crawshay commissioned a new bridge and had [[Watkin George]], his principal engineer at Cyfartha and who had also designed the nearby [[Pont-y-Cafnau]] in 1792,<ref name=\"ET, Watkin\" /> design it. The bridge was built in 1799 and opened at the end of April 1800.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=93}}\n\nThe river needed a span of around {{cvt|70|ft}}, which was too much to have been cast in one piece, or then installed, with the equipment of the time. Although structurally an [[arch bridge]], the bridge was cast in three sections, each almost straight. The outer panels were straight, the centre had a rise of {{cvt|4|in}} in its {{cvt|26|ft}} length.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93, 94-95}} The sides of the bridge were cast as three rectangular panels, including their [[balustrade]]. The ends of the arch were supported on triangular cantilever brackets, cast in two sections. The abutments of the bridge were stone, [[batter (walls)|batter]]ed back with sloping faces so that they met the ends of the arch panels perpendicularly. Where the iron castings abutted against each other was packed with oak planks, two or three inches thick and the width of the iron parts. These were [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]]ed through and clamped. The intention was to give the iron structure some degree of flexibility, as otherwise it would be too brittle.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93, 94-95}} However the short life of the timber gave trouble twenty years later and the bridge required extensive repairs.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=96}}\n\nThe balustrade of the bridge did not form a structural part of it, although it was cast in situ with the main panels.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93, 94-95}}  There were three perpendicular uprights to each panel, with strips forming a pair of intertwined waves between them, giving an 'X' shape in each of the four spaces. These were cast integrally, but had the appearance of [[wrought ironwork]]. Three horizontal strips of wrought iron were riveted to the back, to make the gaps in the balustrade smaller,<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /> and these appear to have been added later.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93}} Its [[parapet#Bridge parapets|parapet]] also included 'heart-shaped' motifs at the centre of the bridge,{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=facing 93}} distinctive to the work of Watkin George.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"Rowson\" />\n\nThe deck of the bridge was formed of cast iron crossbeams. These were an inverted T in section, six inches on each arm and &frac34;\" in section thickness. With a length of twelve feet, they gave a useful carriageway {{cvt|10.5|ft}} wide.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=95}} These crossbeams may have been added in the extensive 1817 repairs.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=96}} The surface of the bridge was formed of stone [[sett (paving)|sett]]s or [[cobblestone|cobble]]s, but these gave a poor surface for walking as they were uneven between the gaps and slippery in rain. In later years the surface was dressed smooth with a layer of the abundant ironworks slag.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" />\n\nThe iron sections are thought to have been [[sand casting|cast]] in open-backed single-sided sand moulds, as one surface shows evidence of surface bubbles.{{efn-lr|More advanced casting techniques would use an enclosed mould, and with the surface restricted to a small [[runner (casting)|runner]] and [[riser (casting)|riser]], which would be cut off afterwards.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" />}}\n\n== Repairs ==\nA series of inspections and repairs were made to the bridge, at two year intervals, from 1801 to 1809. Most of these were to the stonework of the bridge abutments or the stone retaining walls of the riverbank, particularly for improvements to reduce the effects of flooding. The 1809 report on its condition was the first time the name 'Iron Bridge' was recorded.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=95-96}}\n\n=== 1817 repairs ===\nIn 1817, major repairs were made to the ironwork of the bridge itself. [[:en:William Williams (Cyfarthfa)|William Williams]], Watkin George's successor as chief engineer of the ironworks, made a report on its condition and recommended that an iron decking of flat plates should be applied over the existing structure, then a pavement of stone or iron treads be applied over that. The work carried out is not known, but the costs of it exceeded those that would be expected for a mere re-surfacing. The total cost \u00a3354&nbsp;1s&nbsp;10&frac12;d, with \u00a3196&nbsp;11s&nbsp;6d paid for castings and \u00a3147&nbsp;0s&nbsp;2&frac12;d for labour. Williams was paid 10&nbsp;[[guinea]]s for his involvement.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=96}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the cross girders directly beneath the surface of the bridge had been installed during the 1817 repairs, their cost explaining the large sum of paid for castings.<ref name=\"GG, Iron Bridge\" />\n\n1816 and 1817 were boom years for the building of iron bridges in Britain and many surviving bridges date from this period.{{efn-lr|The [[Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow|Wye Bridge, Chepstow]], being a typical example.}} [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] had ended land warfare in Europe but this led to widespread economic and civil disruption.<ref name=\"Gash, 1978\" /> Despite this, ironmasters sought markets for their increasing capacity and to recover the lost markets for military ordnance. Roadbuilding and bridge projects could stimulate a local economy and trade, whilst also providing employment to the demobilised soldiers.\n\n=== 1852 repairs ===\nThe 1852 report was carried out Henry Wren, Superintendent of the local Board of Health. He found that the bridge was significantly decayed, particularly the timber packing between the castings. He went so far as to suggest that the bridge was both unsafe in its current state and that it was beyond economic repair, largely due to the need to dismantle it almost completely. He suggested instead that the first consideration be given to a replacement, and that this replacement should be in the location of the later Ynysgau Bridge.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=96-97}} Such a bridge could be wider, better suited to vehicles, and would be aligned with the two main roads on each side of the river.\n\nHowever a committee of three was tasked with deciding on what to do with the bridge and they chose instead to repair it. The cost was \u00a366&nbsp;12s&nbsp;6&frac12;d, more than half of which was for timberwork.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=96-97}}\n\n=== 1860 report ===\nBy 1860, after a long delay, the Board of Health decided to seriously consider replacement and began with a traffic survey of the current bridge. For a week in June-July, daily traffic from 8am to 8pm was counted:{{sfnp|Davies|1978|pages=97-98}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| \n!

In 1872, a young girl lost both her legs after being run down by a cart.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=99}}\n\n=== Ynsygau Bridge ===\nIn March 1880, a new and larger bridge, the Ynysgau Bridge, also called the New Iron Bridge, was eventually opened next to the old bridge.<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> \n\nThe [[:en:Ynysgau Chapel, Merthyr Tydfil|Ynysgau Chapel]]{{efn-lr|Welsh: \"Amongst them\"}} had been built in 1749 on the East bank of the Taff, adjacent to where the first bridge would be built. The Old Bridge has sometimes been referred to as the Ynysgau Bridge,<ref name=\"ET, Watkin\" /> but this is a modern anachronism, after both had been demolished, and the name belongs to the later bridge.<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, Ynysgau\" />\n\nThe original bridge crossed the river perpendicularly, so as to be the shortest span. The new bridge was on a skew, giving a straighter alignment between Penry Street on the West and into Victoria Street.<ref name=\"NLS\" />{{efn-lr|As the name suggests, Victoria Street post-dated the original bridge.}} This required a longer bridge, and it was also widened to be more easily capable of carrying vehicle traffic.\n\nThis bridge was made of [[wrought iron]] as a [[:en:lattice truss|lattice truss]] structure.<ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> This allowed it to have a flat and horizontal deck all the way across.\n\n=== Removal ===\nThe bridge remained in use until WWII, although as just a footbridge with bollards to prevent vehicles, after which the ends were fenced off, pending its demolition.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=99}} However, once again, the bridge's demise was postponed and it remained in use through the 1950s.<ref name=\"MH, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" />\n\nIn the late 1950s, concern at protecting the town from the river's near annual floods,<ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /> and the increasing number of motor vehicles, led to a widespread scheme to widen the river and canalise it between robust banks. This included a new, wider, bridge in 1958, just North of the iron bridges, a weir to control flow, and demolition of several buildings adjoining the river.<ref name=\"AG, Iron Bridge\" /><ref name=\"AG, 1962\" />\n\nBy September 1963, the bridge was still standing but the surface material had been removed, exposing the cross-girders.<ref name=\"AG, 1962\" /> The complete bridge had gone by the end of November.{{sfnp|Davies|1978|page=99}}\n\nBy  January 1967, all trace of both iron bridges had been removed and the Taff had new, wider concrete banks.<ref name=\"AG, 1962\" /> The Ynsgau Chapel was demolished a few months later.<ref name=\"AG, Ynysgau\" />\n\n=== Storage ===\nComponents are still stored in the grounds of [[:en:Cyfarthfa Castle|Cyfarthfa Castle]] by [[:en:Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council|Merthyr Tydfil CBC]], for possible re-erection.<ref name=\"Coflein\" /> Little is known of them and there are no plans to re-erect them.
