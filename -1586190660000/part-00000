There are many different variations of this story depending on whom you ask. All stories include a girl being involved in some sort of motorized vehicle accident on February 26 (year often changed). One variation of the story includes a girl being involved in a car crash on [[Niles Canyon]] road (off the [[Interstate 680 (California)|680 freeway]] in [[Sunol, California]]) on the way to her [[prom]]. The girl died on impact and to this day is said to haunt Niles Canyon road every February 26. The tale of the haunting goes that people traveling along Niles Canyon road (now [[California State Route 84|Highway 84]]) on the night of February 26 will see a normal-looking high school-aged girl walking along the road in a [[prom dress]] (many people have said it is white). People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride. She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller). Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear. Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there. Today, many people will travel along this treacherous pitch black road in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Niles Canyon ghost.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tracypress.com/view/full_story/2180762/article-Ghost-girl-of-Niles-Canyon-rests|title=Golden State Newspapers|website=Golden State Newspapers|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lovehaight.org/links/secret_sidewalk/white_witch.html|title=Welcome lovehaight.org - Hostmonster.com|website=www.lovehaight.org|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.strangeusa.com/Viewlocation.aspx?id=749|title=Niles Canyon Road Niles Canyon Road Pleasanton, Ca 94588 Alameda County Haunt|last=Montana|first=Matt|website=www.strangeusa.com|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n*http://tracypress.com/view/full_story/2180762/article-Ghost-girl-of-Niles-Canyon-rests\n*http://www.strangeusa.com/Viewlocation.aspx?id=749\n*http://www.lovehaight.org/links/secret_sidewalk/white_witch.html\n\n[[Category:American ghosts]]\n[[Category:Female legendary creatures]]\n", "name_user": "140.82.173.93", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Canyon_ghost"}

Tomlinson was posthumously inducted as a [[Disney Legend]] in 2002. \n\n==Early life==\nTomlinson was born in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]] on 7 May 1917,<ref>General Register Office of England and Wales \u2013 Birth Register for June Quarter of 1917, Henley Registration District, reference 3a 1531, listed as David C.M.

His career was interrupted when he entered [[Second World War]] service as a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. During the war, he served as a flight instructor in [[Canada]] and appeared in three more films.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> His flying days continued after the war. On one occasion he crashed a [[De Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]] plane near his back garden after he lost consciousness while flying.\n\n==Film career==\nDavid Tomlinson was best known for his role as George Banks, head of the Banks family, in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964). ''Mary Poppins'' brought Tomlinson continued work with Disney, appearing in ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968) and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971).

With a population of approximately 350,000, it is the largest city in the [[Bergisches Land]]. Wuppertal is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and its [[suspension railway]], the [[Wuppertal Suspension Railway|Wuppertal Schwebebahn]]. It is the greenest city of Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the Wupper valley was one of the largest industrial regions of continental Europe. The increasing demand for coal from the textile mills and blacksmith shops encouraged the expansion of the nearby ''[[Ruhr]]gebiet''. Wuppertal still is a major industrial centre, being home to industries such as textiles, [[metallurgy]], chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, automobiles, rubber, vehicles and printing equipment.\n\n[[Aspirin]] originates from Wuppertal, patented in 1897 by [[Bayer]], as is the Vorwerk-Kobold [[vacuum cleaner]].<ref name=\"110 Jahre Aspirin\">{{cite web|url=http://geschichtspuls.de/art1294-markenjubilaum-110-jahre-aspirin-kopfschmerzmittel|title=110 Jahre Aspirin|accessdate=May 22, 2011|publisher=GeschichtsPuls|author=Marvin Brendel|language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"Kobold vacuum cleaner\">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.vorwerk.com/en/divisions/kobold-vacuum-cleaners/|title=Official website Vorwerk - Kobold vacuum cleaners|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Wuppertal Institute|Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] and the European Institute for International Economic Relations are located in the city.<ref name=\"EIIW\">{{cite web|url=http://eiiw.eu/index.php?id=3619&L=1|title=Official website European Institute for International Economic Relations|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Wuppertal - ab 1871.svg|thumb|Population development]]\nWuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the industrial cities of [[Barmen]] and [[Elberfeld]] with the communities [[Vohwinkel, Wuppertal|Vohwinkel]], [[Ronsdorf]], [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]], [[Langerfeld]] and [[Beyenburg]]. The initial name '''Barmen-Elberfeld''' was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal (\u201cWupper Valley\u201d). The new city was administered as part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]].\n\nUniquely for Germany, it is a \"[[linear city]]\", owing to the steep hillsides along the river [[Wupper]]. Its highest hill is the [[Lichtscheid]], which is 351 metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The dominant urban centres Elberfeld (historic commercial centre) and Barmen (more industrial) have formed a continuous urbanized area since 1850. During the succeeding decades, \u201cWupper-Town\u201d became the dominant industrial agglomeration of northwestern Germany. During the 20th century, this conurbation had been surpassed by [[Cologne]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and the [[Ruhr area]], all with a more favourable topography.\n\nFrom July 5, 1933 to January 19, 1934, the [[Kemna concentration camp]] was established in Wuppertal. It was one of the early [[Nazi concentration camps]], created by the [[Third Reich]] to [[incarcerate]] their political opponents after the [[Nazi Party]] first gained power in 1933. The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen part of Wuppertal.\nWuppertal is famous as an important place of resistance in Germany. The [[Barmen Declaration]] or the Theological Declaration of Barmen was a document adopted by Christians in Nazi Germany who opposed the ''[[German Christians|Deutsche Christen]]'' philosophy. In the opinion of the delegates to the Synod that met in Wuppertal-Barmen in May 1934, the German Christians had corrupted church government by making it subservient to the state and had introduced Nazi ideology into the German Protestant churches that contradicted the Christian gospel.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], about 40% of buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing, as were many other German cities and industrial centres (see [[Bombing of Wuppertal in World War II]]). However, a large number of historic sites have been preserved, such as:\n\n* \u00d6lberg, literally \u201cOil mountain\u201d, Germany's largest original working class district, is protected as a [[historic monument]]. The name came about during the 1920s as the district continued using oil lamps while the surrounding bourgeois residential quarters were electrified. In traditional use, the name \"\u00d6lberg\" refers to the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n* [[Wuppertal-Brill|Brill]] is one of Germany's largest districts of [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] villas, i.e. middle class mansions built by industrial entrepreneurs during the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe US [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] under Major general [[Edwin P. Parker Jr.]] captured Wuppertal against scant resistance on April 16, 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 147</ref> Wuppertal became a part of the [[British Zone of Occupation]], and subsequently part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in [[West Germany]].\n\nInitially, survivors of the bombings lived in bunkers, provisional camps, or moved in with relatives or friends. Children were told not to play in the ruins.

One of the city\u2019s greatest attractions is the globally unique suspended [[monorail]] ''Wuppertaler Schwebebahn'', which was established in 1901. The tracks are {{convert|8|m|2|abbr=on}} above the streets and {{convert|12|m|2|abbr=on}} above the Wupper. In 1950, a young elephant named [[Tuffi]] was forced to ride the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (monorail), as a promotion for the Althoff Circus. The swinging tram upset the elephant, and she trumpeted, charged, and plummeted 40 feet into the river below. Tuffi suffered minor injuries; she lived until 1989.

Playing their home games at the city's [[Stadion am Zoo]], the club, which enjoyed its last season in a nationwide division during the [[2009\u201310 3. Liga|2009\u201310 season]], looks back on a rich and eventful history since its establishment as the result of a 1954 merger between the two main Wuppertal clubs ''SSV 04 Wuppertal'' and ''TSG Vohwinkel 80''. The club spent a total of seven seasons in the top flight of German football, three of which in the [[Bundesliga]], which they were promoted to during 1972. In their first season in the nationwide first division, the club reached a remarkable fourth place and qualified for the [[1973\u201374 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] for the first and only time in its history. After a first-round defeat by [[Poland|Polish]] side [[Ruch Chorz\u00f3w]] and another two widely unsuccessful Bundesliga campaigns, the club disappeared from the top flight again, though, and has yet to return.\n\nDuring 2004, the club merged with local rivals ''SV Borussia Wuppertal'' to form ''Wuppertaler SV Borussia'', though the name change remained the only visible attribute of the merger with the club's colours and crest remaining unaltered. The additional \"Borussia\" was scrapped again during 2013 due to fans' demand amidst a change of leadership which was brought about to lead the club through necessary insolvency proceedings which have been completed as of September 2014.\n\nAnother noteworthy Wuppertal football club is '''Cronenberger SC''' from the district of [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]]. Their greatest success to date is reaching the 1952 [[German amateur football championship]] final which they lost 5\u20132 against [[BSV 07 Schwenningen|VfR Schwenningen]]. Today, they play one tier below WSV in the [[Oberliga Nordrhein]].\n\nFamous players include [[G\u00fcnter Pr\u00f6pper]] who scored 39 of WSV's 136 Bundesliga goals and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] international [[Horst Szymaniak]], as well as Cronenberg's [[Herbert J\u00e4ger]] who represented [[Germany Olympic football team|Germany]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] during his stay with the club.\n\n=== Team handball ===\nIn '''[[team handball|handball]]''', Wuppertal's most successful team is '''[[Bergischer HC]]''', playing in the top-tier [[Handball-Bundesliga]] which they were promoted to for the second time during 2013, reaching 15th place during the [[2013\u201314 Handball-Bundesliga|2013\u201314 campaign]] and therefore staying among the top scorers for a second consecutive season. ''BHC'' originates from a 2006 cooperation between the management, squad and main sponsor of LTV Wuppertal and rivals SG Solingen from the nearby [[Solingen|city of the same name]]. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire [[Bergisches Land]] region. The team plays its home games at both Wuppertal's ''[[Uni-Halle]]'' (3,200 seats) and Solingen's ''Klingenhalle'' (2,600 seats).\n\nWuppertal's past most successful club are the aforementioned '''LTV Wuppertal'''. LTV spent most of their seasons in the second and third tiers, before they merged with ''Wuppertaler SV's'' handball section in 1996 to form ''HSG LTV/WSV Wuppertal''. The handball combination was promoted to the Bundesliga after its inaugural season, finishing 8th before dissolving again in 1998. However, the mere departure of Wuppertaler SV still allowed LTV Wuppertal, whose professional team were renamed ''HC Wuppertal'', to play another three seasons in the Bundesliga before returning to the 2nd division and re-introducing its old name. After the establishment of BHC in 2006, LTV lost its financial base and was relegated several times, currently playing in the fifth-tier Verbandsliga.\n\n=== Volleyball ===\nIn '''[[volleyball]]''', '''SV Bayer Wuppertal''' was one of Germany's leading men's teams for many years during the 1990s and 2000s. The team was part of the well-known mass-sports club originating in [[Leverkusen]] and was promoted to the Bundesliga in 1978. Reacting to low attendances, the eponymous [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] decided to relocate the volleyball team to Wuppertal in 1992, where there also was a Bayer-funded club. After the move, the club won various titles, including the German championship in 1994 and 1997 and the German Cup in 1995. In addition to that, they finished runners-up to [[Greece|Greek]] side [[Olympiacos S.C.]] in the 1995-96 [[CEV Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], losing the final in five sets.\n\nAfter the wide-reaching retreat of Bayer AG from less popular professional sport during 2008, the club acquired the name ''Wuppertal Titans'' and later ''A!B!C Titans Berg. Land''. However, the loss of their main sponsor eventually resulted in the team having to terminate during 2012. Presently, they once more play by the name of Bayer Wuppertal in the third-tier Regionalliga, unable to promote with their current financial set-up.\n\n=== Basketball ===\nPerhaps one of the most successful Wuppertal sports clubs was the '''[[women's basketball]]''' team of '''[[Wuppertal Wings|Barmer TV]]''' (known as ''BTV Wuppertal'' between 1994 and 2000, ''BTV Gold-Zack Wuppertal'' between 2000 and 2002 and ''Wuppertal Wings'' internationally). An 11-time [[List of German basketball champions#German champions (women)|German champion]] and 12-time German Cup winner, they won a remarkable ten consecutive doubles between 1993 and 2002. During [[1995\u201396 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup|1996]], they even won the [[EuroLeague Women|European Cup]] as the first and so far only German side, beating [[Italy|Italy's]] [[SFT Como]] in the final. A year later, they narrowly missed out on back-to-back trebles, losing to [[France|French]] side [[CJM Bourges]] in the [[1997 EuroLeague Women|newly christened EuroLeague's]] final.\n\nIn 2002, the club withdrew from the Bundesliga due to financial troubles, their then-main sponsor ''Gold-Zack Werke'' filing for insolvency a year later. After a decade-long stay in amateur divisions, Barmer TV returned to the second-tier 2nd Bundesliga North in 2014.\n\nWuppertal co-hosted the [[1998 FIBA World Championship for Women]] as one of seven host cities.\n\n=== Roller hockey ===\nIn '''[[Roller hockey (Quad)|roller hockey]]''' (also known as ''rink hockey''), Wuppertal club '''RSC Cronenberg''' are one of the most successful German teams, having won the [[Rink Hockey Bundesliga|German championship]] and the German Cup in both men's and women's competitions. In total, the men won 13 German championships and nine cups, the women ten championships and nine cups. Both teams play their home games at ''Alfred-Henckels-Halle''.\n\nWuppertal hosted several international tournaments, including the World Championship in [[1997 Roller Hockey World Cup|1997]] ([[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup|men]]) and [[2004 Ladies Rink Hockey World Championship|2004]] ([[FIRS Women's Roller Hockey World Cup|women]]) and the European Championship in [[1992 Rink Hockey European Championship|1992]], [[2010 Rink Hockey European Championship|2010]] ([[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|men]]) and [[CERH Women's Euro 2011|2011]] ([[CERH European Women's Roller Hockey Championship|women]]).\n\n==Education==\n[[File:GER Wuppertal Junioruni 005 2016.jpg|thumb| Junior Uni Campus, designet 2013 by the Wuppertal Architects Goedeking& Niedworok]]\nFour institutions of [[higher education]] are in Wuppertal.\n* [[University of Wuppertal]] (Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal)\n* [[FOM University of Applied Sciences for Economics and Management|FOM University of Applied Sciences]]\n* [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln|Cologne University of Music, section Wuppertal]]\n* College of Theology, Wuppertal/Bethel (Theologische Zentrum Wuppertal)\n\nThe privately financed Junior Uni is a unique German initiative to educate youth from the age of 4 to 18 in science outside the school program.>{{cite web|url=http://www.junioruni-wuppertal.de|title=Official website Junior Uni Wuppertal - Bergisches Land|language=german|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Wuppertal D\u00f6ppersberg 2018 129.jpg|thumb|Central Station]]\nWuppertal is well connected to the rail network.

With a population of approximately 350,000, it is the largest city in the [[Bergisches Land]]. Wuppertal is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and its [[suspension railway]], the [[Wuppertal Suspension Railway|Wuppertal Schwebebahn]]. It is the greenest city of Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the Wupper valley was one of the largest industrial regions of continental Europe. The increasing demand for coal from the textile mills and blacksmith shops encouraged the expansion of the nearby ''[[Ruhr]]gebiet''. Wuppertal still is a major industrial centre, being home to industries such as textiles, [[metallurgy]], chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, automobiles, rubber, vehicles and printing equipment.\n\n[[Aspirin]] originates from Wuppertal, patented in 1897 by [[Bayer]], as is the Vorwerk-Kobold [[vacuum cleaner]].<ref name=\"110 Jahre Aspirin\">{{cite web|url=http://geschichtspuls.de/art1294-markenjubilaum-110-jahre-aspirin-kopfschmerzmittel|title=110 Jahre Aspirin|accessdate=May 22, 2011|publisher=GeschichtsPuls|author=Marvin Brendel|language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"Kobold vacuum cleaner\">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.vorwerk.com/en/divisions/kobold-vacuum-cleaners/|title=Official website Vorwerk - Kobold vacuum cleaners|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Wuppertal Institute|Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] and the European Institute for International Economic Relations are located in the city.<ref name=\"EIIW\">{{cite web|url=http://eiiw.eu/index.php?id=3619&L=1|title=Official website European Institute for International Economic Relations|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Wuppertal - ab 1871.svg|thumb|Population development]]\nWuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the industrial cities of [[Barmen]] and [[Elberfeld]] with the communities [[Vohwinkel, Wuppertal|Vohwinkel]], [[Ronsdorf]], [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]], [[Langerfeld]] and [[Beyenburg]]. The initial name '''Barmen-Elberfeld''' was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal (\u201cWupper Valley\u201d). The new city was administered as part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]].\n\nUniquely for Germany, it is a \"[[linear city]]\", owing to the steep hillsides along the river [[Wupper]]. Its highest hill is the [[Lichtscheid]], which is 351 metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The dominant urban centres Elberfeld (historic commercial centre) and Barmen (more industrial) have formed a continuous urbanized area since 1850. During the succeeding decades, \u201cWupper-Town\u201d became the dominant industrial agglomeration of northwestern Germany. During the 20th century, this conurbation had been surpassed by [[Cologne]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and the [[Ruhr area]], all with a more favourable topography.\n\nFrom July 5, 1933 to January 19, 1934, the [[Kemna concentration camp]] was established in Wuppertal. It was one of the early [[Nazi concentration camps]], created by the [[Third Reich]] to [[incarcerate]] their political opponents after the [[Nazi Party]] first gained power in 1933. The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen part of Wuppertal.\nWuppertal is famous as an important place of resistance in Germany. The [[Barmen Declaration]] or the Theological Declaration of Barmen was a document adopted by Christians in Nazi Germany who opposed the ''[[German Christians|Deutsche Christen]]'' philosophy. In the opinion of the delegates to the Synod that met in Wuppertal-Barmen in May 1934, the German Christians had corrupted church government by making it subservient to the state and had introduced Nazi ideology into the German Protestant churches that contradicted the Christian gospel.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], about 40% of buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing, as were many other German cities and industrial centres (see [[Bombing of Wuppertal in World War II]]). However, a large number of historic sites have been preserved, such as:\n\n* \u00d6lberg, literally \u201cOil mountain\u201d, Germany\u2019s largest original working class district, is protected as a [[historic monument]]. The name came about during the 1920s as the district continued using oil lamps while the surrounding bourgeois residential quarters were electrified. In traditional use, the name \"\u00d6lberg\" refers to the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n* [[Wuppertal-Brill|Brill]] is one of Germany\u2019s largest districts of [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] villas, i.e. middle class mansions built by industrial entrepreneurs during the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe US [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] under Major general [[Edwin P. Parker Jr.]] captured Wuppertal against scant resistance on April 16, 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 147</ref> Wuppertal became a part of the [[British Zone of Occupation]], and subsequently part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in [[West Germany]].\n\nInitially, survivors of the bombings lived in bunkers, provisional camps, or moved in with relatives or friends. Children were told not to play in the ruins.

One of the city\u2019s greatest attractions is the globally unique suspended [[monorail]] ''Wuppertaler Schwebebahn'', which was established in 1901. The tracks are {{convert|8|m|2|abbr=on}} above the streets and {{convert|12|m|2|abbr=on}} above the Wupper. In 1950, a young elephant named [[Tuffi]] was forced to ride the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (monorail), as a promotion for the Althoff Circus. The swinging tram upset the elephant, and she trumpeted, charged, and plummeted 40 feet into the river below. Tuffi suffered minor injuries; she lived until 1989.

Playing their home games at the city's [[Stadion am Zoo]], the club, which enjoyed its last season in a nationwide division during the [[2009\u201310 3. Liga|2009\u201310 season]], looks back on a rich and eventful history since its establishment as the result of a 1954 merger between the two main Wuppertal clubs ''SSV 04 Wuppertal'' and ''TSG Vohwinkel 80''. The club spent a total of seven seasons in the top flight of German football, three of which in the [[Bundesliga]], which they were promoted to during 1972. In their first season in the nationwide first division, the club reached a remarkable fourth place and qualified for the [[1973\u201374 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] for the first and only time in its history. After a first-round defeat by [[Poland|Polish]] side [[Ruch Chorz\u00f3w]] and another two widely unsuccessful Bundesliga campaigns, the club disappeared from the top flight again, though, and has yet to return.\n\nDuring 2004, the club merged with local rivals ''SV Borussia Wuppertal'' to form ''Wuppertaler SV Borussia'', though the name change remained the only visible attribute of the merger with the club's colours and crest remaining unaltered. The additional \"Borussia\" was scrapped again during 2013 due to fans' demand amidst a change of leadership which was brought about to lead the club through necessary insolvency proceedings which have been completed as of September 2014.\n\nAnother noteworthy Wuppertal football club is '''Cronenberger SC''' from the district of [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]]. Their greatest success to date is reaching the 1952 [[German amateur football championship]] final which they lost 5\u20132 against [[BSV 07 Schwenningen|VfR Schwenningen]]. Today, they play one tier below WSV in the [[Oberliga Nordrhein]].\n\nFamous players include [[G\u00fcnter Pr\u00f6pper]] who scored 39 of WSV's 136 Bundesliga goals and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] international [[Horst Szymaniak]], as well as Cronenberg's [[Herbert J\u00e4ger]] who represented [[Germany Olympic football team|Germany]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] during his stay with the club.\n\n=== Team handball ===\nIn '''[[team handball|handball]]''', Wuppertal's most successful team is '''[[Bergischer HC]]''', playing in the top-tier [[Handball-Bundesliga]] which they were promoted to for the second time during 2013, reaching 15th place during the [[2013\u201314 Handball-Bundesliga|2013\u201314 campaign]] and therefore staying among the top scorers for a second consecutive season. ''BHC'' originates from a 2006 cooperation between the management, squad and main sponsor of LTV Wuppertal and rivals SG Solingen from the nearby [[Solingen|city of the same name]]. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire [[Bergisches Land]] region. The team plays its home games at both Wuppertal's ''[[Uni-Halle]]'' (3,200 seats) and Solingen's ''Klingenhalle'' (2,600 seats).\n\nWuppertal's past most successful club are the aforementioned '''LTV Wuppertal'''. LTV spent most of their seasons in the second and third tiers, before they merged with ''Wuppertaler SV's'' handball section in 1996 to form ''HSG LTV/WSV Wuppertal''. The handball combination was promoted to the Bundesliga after its inaugural season, finishing 8th before dissolving again in 1998. However, the mere departure of Wuppertaler SV still allowed LTV Wuppertal, whose professional team were renamed ''HC Wuppertal'', to play another three seasons in the Bundesliga before returning to the 2nd division and re-introducing its old name. After the establishment of BHC in 2006, LTV lost its financial base and was relegated several times, currently playing in the fifth-tier Verbandsliga.\n\n=== Volleyball ===\nIn '''[[volleyball]]''', '''SV Bayer Wuppertal''' was one of Germany's leading men's teams for many years during the 1990s and 2000s. The team was part of the well-known mass-sports club originating in [[Leverkusen]] and was promoted to the Bundesliga in 1978. Reacting to low attendances, the eponymous [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] decided to relocate the volleyball team to Wuppertal in 1992, where there also was a Bayer-funded club. After the move, the club won various titles, including the German championship in 1994 and 1997 and the German Cup in 1995. In addition to that, they finished runners-up to [[Greece|Greek]] side [[Olympiacos S.C.]] in the 1995-96 [[CEV Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], losing the final in five sets.\n\nAfter the wide-reaching retreat of Bayer AG from less popular professional sport during 2008, the club acquired the name ''Wuppertal Titans'' and later ''A!B!C Titans Berg. Land''. However, the loss of their main sponsor eventually resulted in the team having to terminate during 2012. Presently, they once more play by the name of Bayer Wuppertal in the third-tier Regionalliga, unable to promote with their current financial set-up.\n\n=== Basketball ===\nPerhaps one of the most successful Wuppertal sports clubs was the '''[[women's basketball]]''' team of '''[[Wuppertal Wings|Barmer TV]]''' (known as ''BTV Wuppertal'' between 1994 and 2000, ''BTV Gold-Zack Wuppertal'' between 2000 and 2002 and ''Wuppertal Wings'' internationally). An 11-time [[List of German basketball champions#German champions (women)|German champion]] and 12-time German Cup winner, they won a remarkable ten consecutive doubles between 1993 and 2002. During [[1995\u201396 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup|1996]], they even won the [[EuroLeague Women|European Cup]] as the first and so far only German side, beating [[Italy|Italy's]] [[SFT Como]] in the final. A year later, they narrowly missed out on back-to-back trebles, losing to [[France|French]] side [[CJM Bourges]] in the [[1997 EuroLeague Women|newly christened EuroLeague's]] final.\n\nIn 2002, the club withdrew from the Bundesliga due to financial troubles, their then-main sponsor ''Gold-Zack Werke'' filing for insolvency a year later. After a decade-long stay in amateur divisions, Barmer TV returned to the second-tier 2nd Bundesliga North in 2014.\n\nWuppertal co-hosted the [[1998 FIBA World Championship for Women]] as one of seven host cities.\n\n=== Roller hockey ===\nIn '''[[Roller hockey (Quad)|roller hockey]]''' (also known as ''rink hockey''), Wuppertal club '''RSC Cronenberg''' are one of the most successful German teams, having won the [[Rink Hockey Bundesliga|German championship]] and the German Cup in both men's and women's competitions. In total, the men won 13 German championships and nine cups, the women ten championships and nine cups. Both teams play their home games at ''Alfred-Henckels-Halle''.\n\nWuppertal hosted several international tournaments, including the World Championship in [[1997 Roller Hockey World Cup|1997]] ([[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup|men]]) and [[2004 Ladies Rink Hockey World Championship|2004]] ([[FIRS Women's Roller Hockey World Cup|women]]) and the European Championship in [[1992 Rink Hockey European Championship|1992]], [[2010 Rink Hockey European Championship|2010]] ([[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|men]]) and [[CERH Women's Euro 2011|2011]] ([[CERH European Women's Roller Hockey Championship|women]]).\n\n==Education==\n[[File:GER Wuppertal Junioruni 005 2016.jpg|thumb| Junior Uni Campus, designet 2013 by the Wuppertal Architects Goedeking& Niedworok]]\nFour institutions of [[higher education]] are in Wuppertal.\n* [[University of Wuppertal]] (Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal)\n* [[FOM University of Applied Sciences for Economics and Management|FOM University of Applied Sciences]]\n* [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln|Cologne University of Music, section Wuppertal]]\n* College of Theology, Wuppertal/Bethel (Theologische Zentrum Wuppertal)\n\nThe privately financed Junior Uni is a unique German initiative to educate youth from the age of 4 to 18 in science outside the school program.>{{cite web|url=http://www.junioruni-wuppertal.de|title=Official website Junior Uni Wuppertal - Bergisches Land|language=german|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Wuppertal D\u00f6ppersberg 2018 129.jpg|thumb|Central Station]]\nWuppertal is well connected to the rail network.

The district extends from 24\n0\n03' and 23\n0\n38' N latitude and 86\n0\n28' and\n87\n0\n04' E longitude and has an area of 2481km<sup>2</sup>. It had a population of {{formatnum:1,491,879}}\npeople, according to the 2011 [[Census of India]].\n\nThe district contains several clusters of rocky hills covered with forest, with a series of long ridges with intervening depressions. Most of the rolling highlands are cultivated by highland crops. The average elevation of the district is 247 m above mean sea level. However, hill ranges like Phuljari (750 m), Teror (670 m), and Degaria (575 m) break the monotony of the landscape. The general slope of the district is from northwest to southeast. Geologically the district is mainly covered by Chhota Nagpur granite gneiss of Archean age with patches of alluvium, sandstone, and shale of Gondwana formations. Important rivers flowing in the district include the Ajay and the Paltro. These rivers gather a large number of tributaries that form the landscape full of Tanrs and Dons.\n\n[[File:Navlakha Temple 3.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Naulakha Temple]]\n\n===Cities and villages===\nTaluk Name State Deoghar, Madhupur, Chitra, Sarsa Kushmaha, Majhiyana, Tharidulampur, Jamua, Charakmara, Palojori, Devipur, Sarwan, Sarath, Karon, Mohanpur, Rohni, babangaua, Ghorlash, Jasidih, Koridih, Raihdih, Gidhaiya, Jitjori.\n\n===Climate===\nThe district experiences a hot summer, which usually lasts from March to May.

Being one of the most sacred temples in India, the Baidyanath Temple holds a spiritual high ground among other temples owing to its religious significance and its architecture.{{or-inline|date=March 2019}} Located in Deoghar in the Santhal Parganas division of the state of Jharkhand in India, this large temple complex comprises the main temple of Baba Baidyanath, where the Jyotirlinga is installed, along with twenty-one other temples.{{fact|date=March 2019}} \nThe temple is mentioned in several ancient scriptures and continues to be mentioned even in modern-day history books. The story of the origin of this Jyotirlinga goes back to the Treta Yuga, in the era of Lord Rama. According to popular Hindu beliefs, the demon Ravana, king of Lanka, worshipped Shiva at this very site, where the temple is currently located. Ravana offered his ten heads one after the other, as a sacrifice to Lord Shiva. Pleased with this act, Shiva proceeded to descend to the Earth to cure Ravana, who was injured.

{"title_page": "History of Wuhan", "text_new": "The city of [[Wuhan]], the capital city of [[Hubei]] province, [[China]], has a long and rich history that dates back over 3,500 years. Starting out from the [[Shang Dynasty]]-era archaeological site at [[Panlongcheng]] associated with [[Erligang culture]], the region would become part of the [[E (state)|E state]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu state]] during the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The region evolved into an important port on the middle reaches of the [[Yangtze River]], and the cities of [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], [[Hankou]] and [[Wuchang]] were united into the city of Wuhan in 1926. Wuhan briefly serving as the capital city of China in 1927 in 1937. Modern-day Wuhan is known as 'China's Thoroughfare' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) due to its status as a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities.\n\n==Antiquity==\n\n[[File:Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng Wuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng]], made in 433 B.C., now on display at the [[Hubei Provincial Museum]] in Wuhan|left]]\nWith a 3,500-year-long history, Wuhan is one of the most ancient and civilized metropolitan cities in China.  [[Panlongcheng]], an archaeological site associated with the [[Erligang culture]], is located in modern-day [[Huangpi District]]. During the [[Western Zhou]], the [[E (state)|E state]] controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the [[Chu (state)|Chu state]] for the rest of the Western Zhou and [[Eastern Zhou]] periods.\n\n==Early Imperial China==\n\nDuring the [[Han dynasty]], Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The [[Battle of Xiakou]] in AD 203 and [[Battle of Jiangxia]] five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan|Xinzhou District]] in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in [[Chinese history]] and a central event in the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''\u2014the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]\u2014took place in the vicinity of the cliffs near Wuhan.<ref>\"The engagement at the Red Cliffs took place in the winter of the 13th year of Jian'an, probably about the end of 208.\"{{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=264}}</ref> Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the [[Yellow Crane Tower]] (\u9ec4\u9e64\u697c), one of the [[Four Great Towers of China]], was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of [[Sun Quan]], leader of the [[Eastern Wu]].\n[[File:Xia Yong - Huang He Lou.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Yellow Crane Tower]]|left]]\nDue to tensions between the [[Eastern Wu]] and [[Cao Wei]] states, in the autumn of 228,{{efn|name=fn1|Man Chong's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' mentioned that these events took place in the 3rd year of the Taihe era (227\u2013233) of Cao Rui's reign, i.e., the year 229. This is a mistake. It was actually in the 2nd year of the Taihe era, i.e., the year 228, according to the ''Zizhi Tongjian''.<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 71.</ref>}} [[Cao Rui]], grandson of [[Cao Cao]] and the second emperor of the state of [[Cao Wei]], ordered the general [[Man Chong]] to lead troops to Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; in present-day Wuhan).<ref>(\u79cb\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f9\u4f11\u5f9e\u5eec\u6c5f\u5357\u5165\u5408\u80a5\uff0c\u4ee4\u5bf5\u5411\u590f\u53e3\u3002) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 26.</ref>\n\nIn 279, [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]] wrote a [[Memorial to the throne|memorial]] to Emperor Wu, requesting that he order a military campaign against Eastern Wu. The emperor agreed, appointed Wang Jun as Prancing Dragon General (\u9f8d\u9a64\u5c07\u8ecd) and ordered him to lead troops from Yi Province's capital, [[Chengdu]], to invade Eastern Wu. Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (\u897f\u9675; in present-day [[Yichang]], Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day [[Ezhou]], Hubei). When the Jin invasion forces reached the Wu capital [[Jiankang|Jianye]], the last Wu emperor [[Sun Hao]] surrendered, thus bringing an end to the [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquest of Wu]].\n\nIn fall 550, [[Hou Jing]] sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan.  Xiao Guan, not willing to engage Wang, abandoned Jiangxia and fled to Ru'nan (\u6c5d\u5357, in modern [[Jingmen]], [[Hubei]]), where he entered into an alliance with Eastern Wei's successor state [[Northern Qi]] (with Gao Cheng's brother [[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi|Gao Yang]] having seized the throne in summer 550) and was created the [[Liang (realm)|Prince of Liang]] as well.  Meanwhile, Hou made Emperor Jianwen create him the Prince of Han.\n\nIn summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned [[Wu Mingche]] as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf).  The opposing sides met at Dunkou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan). Wu and Chunyu were able to ram Hua's, Northern Zhou's, and Western Liang's fleets, causing them to collapse.  Hua and the Northern Zhou general Yuwen Zhi (\u5b87\u6587\u76f4) were forced to flee to Western Liang's capital Jiangling.  In light of the victory, Wu first captured Western Liang's Hedong Commandery (\u6cb3\u6771, part of modern Jingzhou), and then further put Jiangling under siege.  Western Liang's Emperor Ming was forced to flee to the subsidiary fort of Ji'nan (\u7d00\u5357, near Jiangling).\n[[File:Wuhan_Wuying_Ta_2012.11.21_10-44-59.jpg|thumb|[[Wuying Pagoda]], a Buddhist pagoda rebuilt in Wuchang during the [[Southern Song]] dynasty.]]\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies.[[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]], a celebrated poet of the [[Tang dynasty]], visited the building in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.<ref name=\"Wan1\">Wan: Page 42.</ref>\n\nIn spring 877, [[Wang Xianzhi (rebel)|Wang Xianzhi]] captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).  He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (\u5b8b\u5dde, in modern [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]).  Only after the imperial general Zhang Zimian (\u5f35\u81ea\u52c9) came to Song Wei's aid did the agrarian rebels release their hold on Song Wei.  Wang Xianzhi then headed south, successively capturing An Prefecture (\u5b89\u5dde, in modern [[Xiaogan]], [[Hubei]]) and Sui Prefecture (\u96a8\u5dde, in modern [[Suizhou]], [[Hubei]]), before further raiding Fu (\u5fa9\u5dde, in modern [[Tianmen]], [[Hubei]]) and Ying (\u90e2\u5dde, in modern [[Jingmen]], [[Hubei]]).<ref name=ZZTJ253>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377253|vol. 253]].</ref>\n\nIn winter 877, [[Huang Chao]] pillaged Qi and Huang (\u9ec3\u5dde, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.  The Tang general Zeng Yuanyu (\u66fe\u5143\u88d5) defeated him, however, and he fled.<ref name=\"ZZTJ253\"/> In 894, Wu Tao (\u5433\u8a0e) the prefect of Huang Prefecture (\u9ec3\u5dde, modern Wuhan), who was under [[Du Hong]] the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (\u6b66\u660c, headquartered in modern Wuhan), offered to submit to [[Yang Xingmi]].  In response, Du put Huang Circuit under siege.  Yang sent Zhu to aid Wu.  When another subordinate of Du's, Feng Jingzhang (\u99ae\u656c\u7ae0) the prefect of Qi Prefecture (\u8604\u5dde, in modern [[Huanggang]], Hubei) tried to intercept Zhu, Zhu put Qi Prefecture under siege but was initially unable to capture it.  However, it appeared that subsequently, after Wu evacuated Huang Prefecture, Yang's forces were nevertheless able to hold it.<ref name=ZZTJ259>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377259|vol. 259]].</ref>\n\nBefore [[Kublai Khan]] arrived in 1259, word reached him that M\u00f6ngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on Wuhan, near the [[Yangtze]]. While Kublai's force besieged [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], Uryankhadai joined him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The present-day [[Wuying Pagoda]] was constructed at the end of the [[Song Dynasty]] between attacks by the Mongolian forces. Under the [[Mongol]] rulers ([[Yuan dynasty]]), Wuchang was promoted to the status of provincial capital.\n\n==Qing dynasty==\n\n===Opening Hankou as a trading port===\n\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important [[transshipment]] point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a [[concession (territory)|concession]] in Hankou.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=USFD_d-d7FhgC&pg=PA83&dq=french+Guangzhouwan&cd=2#v=onepage&qa=french%20Guangzhouwan&f=false ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'', Google Print, p. 83], Robert Aldrich, Palgrave Macmillan, 1996, {{ISBN|0-312-16000-3}}</ref>\n[[File:HuangHe_Tower2.jpg|thumb|The [[Yellow Crane Tower]] in 1871|left]]\nDuring the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan. And in the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of {{convert|30.53|km2}} along the Yangtze River (from Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road today) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession. Thus, Hankou became an open trading port.\n\n===Hubei under Zhang Zhidong===\n\n[[File:Hankow Bund c. 1900.jpg|thumb|Foreign concessions along the Hankow Bund c. 1900.]]\nIn 1889, [[Zhang Zhidong]] was transferred from [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces) to [[Viceroy of Huguang]] ([[Hunan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei. All of these laid a solid foundation for the modernization of Wuhan.\n\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] was founded in 1891 by [[Qing]] official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the [[Nanyang Fleet]] in [[Guangdong]] to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V682XHpDLXoC&pg=PA414&dq=new+chinese+rifle+factory+han+yang#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Chinese Recorder|author=Kathleen L Lodwick|year=2009|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|location=|page=414|isbn=978-1-115-48856-3|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some {{Convert|40|acre|m2}}, could start production of small-calibre cannons.

After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT [[gunboat]] ''[[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan|Zhongshan]]'' came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the ''Zhongshan'' sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/news.jsp?fileId=117667|title=HOME-CCTVPLUS|website=newscontent.cctv.com}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Bombing of Wuhan====\nAs a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China and the Chinese leadership in Chongqing, namely Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng and He Yingqin, approved the tactic of strategic firebombing of the major occupied city of Wuhan.<ref>http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/</ref> In December 1944, the city was largely destroyed by U.S. [[firebombing]] raids conducted by the [[Fourteenth Air Force]].

Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nIn 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\n====Completion of the First Yangtze River Bridge====\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\n[[File:Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge-1.jpg|thumb|[[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|The First Yangtze River Bridge]]]]\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. The Engineering Bureau of the First Yangtze River Bridge, set up by the Ministry of Railway in April 1953, was responsible for the design and construction of the bridge. The document \"Resolutions on Building the First Yangtze River Bridge\" was passed in the 203rd conference of State Council on January 15, 1954. The technical conference on the routes of the bridge, held in Hankou on January 15, 1955, determined that the route from Tortoise Hill to Snake Hill was the best choice.\n\nOn October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The bridge is {{convert|1670|m|2|abbr=on}} long, of which the upper level is a highway with a width of {{convert|22.5|m|2|abbr=on}} and the lower level is a double-line railway with a width of {{convert|18|m|2|abbr=on}}. The bridge proper is {{convert|1156|m|2|abbr=on}} long with two pairs of eight piers and nine arches with a space of {{convert|128|m|2|abbr=on}} between each arch. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a thoroughfare to nine provinces in name and in fact.\n\n====Beidaihe Conference====\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories.

Starting out from the [[Shang Dynasty]]-era archaeological site at [[Panlongcheng]] associated with [[Erligang culture]], the region would become part of the [[E (state)|E state]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu state]] during the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The region evolved into an important port on the middle reaches of the [[Yangtze River]], and the cities of [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], [[Hankou]] and [[Wuchang]] were united into the city of Wuhan in 1926. Wuhan briefly serving as the capital city of China in 1927 in 1937. Modern-day Wuhan is known as 'China's Thoroughfare' (\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862) due to its status as a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities.\n\n==Antiquity==\n\n[[File:Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng Wuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng]], made in 433 B.C., now on display at the [[Hubei Provincial Museum]] in Wuhan|left]]\nWith a 3,500-year-long history, Wuhan is one of the most ancient and civilized metropolitan cities in China.  [[Panlongcheng]], an archaeological site associated with the [[Erligang culture]], is located in modern-day [[Huangpi District]]. During the [[Western Zhou]], the [[E (state)|E state]] controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the [[Chu (state)|Chu state]] for the rest of the Western Zhou and [[Eastern Zhou]] periods.\n\n==Early Imperial China==\n\nDuring the [[Han dynasty]], Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The [[Battle of Xiakou]] in AD 203 and [[Battle of Jiangxia]] five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan|Xinzhou District]] in northeast Wuhan). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in [[Chinese history]] and a central event in the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''\u2014the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]\u2014took place in the vicinity of the cliffs near Wuhan.<ref>\"The engagement at the Red Cliffs took place in the winter of the 13th year of Jian'an, probably about the end of 208.\"{{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=264}}</ref> Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the [[Yellow Crane Tower]] (\u9ec4\u9e64\u697c), one of the [[Four Great Towers of China]], was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of [[Sun Quan]], leader of the [[Eastern Wu]].\n[[File:Xia Yong - Huang He Lou.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Yellow Crane Tower]]|left]]\nDue to tensions between the [[Eastern Wu]] and [[Cao Wei]] states, in the autumn of 228,{{efn|name=fn1|Man Chong's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' mentioned that these events took place in the 3rd year of the Taihe era (227\u2013233) of Cao Rui's reign, i.e., the year 229.

The emperor agreed, appointed Wang Jun as Prancing Dragon General (\u9f8d\u9a64\u5c07\u8ecd) and ordered him to lead troops from Yi Province's capital, [[Chengdu]], to invade Eastern Wu. Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (\u897f\u9675; in present-day [[Yichang]], Hubei), Xiakou (\u590f\u53e3; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day [[Ezhou]], Hubei). When the Jin invasion forces reached the Wu capital [[Jiankang|Jianye]], the last Wu emperor [[Sun Hao]] surrendered, thus bringing an end to the [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquest of Wu]].\n\nIn fall 550, [[Hou Jing]] sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (\u856d\u55e3).  Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control.  Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire\u2014believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne\u2014and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan.  Xiao Guan, not willing to engage Wang, abandoned Jiangxia and fled to Ru'nan (\u6c5d\u5357, in modern [[Jingmen]], [[Hubei]]), where he entered into an alliance with Eastern Wei's successor state [[Northern Qi]] (with Gao Cheng's brother [[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi|Gao Yang]] having seized the throne in summer 550) and was created the [[Liang (realm)|Prince of Liang]] as well.  Meanwhile, Hou made Emperor Jianwen create him the Prince of Han.\n\nIn summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned [[Wu Mingche]] as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (\u6df3\u4e8e\u91cf).  The opposing sides met at Dunkou (\u6c8c\u53e3, in modern Wuhan). Wu and Chunyu were able to ram Hua's, Northern Zhou's, and Western Liang's fleets, causing them to collapse.  Hua and the Northern Zhou general Yuwen Zhi (\u5b87\u6587\u76f4) were forced to flee to Western Liang's capital Jiangling.  In light of the victory, Wu first captured Western Liang's Hedong Commandery (\u6cb3\u6771, part of modern Jingzhou), and then further put Jiangling under siege.  Western Liang's Emperor Ming was forced to flee to the subsidiary fort of Ji'nan (\u7d00\u5357, near Jiangling).\n[[File:Wuhan_Wuying_Ta_2012.11.21_10-44-59.jpg|thumb|[[Wuying Pagoda]], a Buddhist pagoda rebuilt in Wuchang during the [[Southern Song]] dynasty.]]\nThe city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies.[[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]], a celebrated poet of the [[Tang dynasty]], visited the building in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.<ref name=\"Wan1\">Wan: Page 42.</ref>\n\nIn spring 877, [[Wang Xianzhi (rebel)|Wang Xianzhi]] captured E Prefecture (\u9102\u5dde, in modern Wuhan).

In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important [[transshipment]] point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities.

In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan. And in the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of {{convert|30.53|km2}} along the Yangtze River (from Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road today) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession. Thus, Hankou became an open trading port.\n\n===Hubei under Zhang Zhidong===\n\n[[File:Hankow Bund c. 1900.jpg|thumb|Foreign concessions along the Hankow Bund c. 1900.]]\nIn 1889, [[Zhang Zhidong]] was transferred from [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces) to [[Viceroy of Huguang]] ([[Hunan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China\u2019s modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.

After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.\n\nIn early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT [[gunboat]] ''[[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan|Zhongshan]]'' came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the ''Zhongshan'' sank with 25 casualties.

Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nIn 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\n====Completion of the First Yangtze River Bridge====\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.\n[[File:Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge-1.jpg|thumb|[[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|The First Yangtze River Bridge]]]]\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. The Engineering Bureau of the First Yangtze River Bridge, set up by the Ministry of Railway in April 1953, was responsible for the design and construction of the bridge. The document \"Resolutions on Building the First Yangtze River Bridge\" was passed in the 203rd conference of State Council on January 15, 1954. The technical conference on the routes of the bridge, held in Hankou on January 15, 1955, determined that the route from Tortoise Hill to Snake Hill was the best choice.\n\nOn October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The bridge is {{convert|1670|m|2|abbr=on}} long, of which the upper level is a highway with a width of {{convert|22.5|m|2|abbr=on}} and the lower level is a double-line railway with a width of {{convert|18|m|2|abbr=on}}.

The total number of chairs and clinics is 107. Altogether, 891 academic professors and teachers work at the Medical University and about 3,500 students study there.\n\nWroc\u0142aw Medical University has 22 international agreements of cooperation signed with other universities abroad. There is a wide exchange of students and teaching staff within the framework of the [[Socrates programme|Socrates]] and [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus]] programmes of the [[European Union]], especially with France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands and England.\n\n==History==\nWroc\u0142aw is a city with a rich medical tradition. The first hospital was founded in the 13th century. Medicine was first taught in 1745 by the establishment of the Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum. It was the first medical school in the city. Many famous doctors lived and worked in Wroc\u0142aw such as [[Alois Alzheimer]] - [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]], who presented his findings regarding degeneration of the [[brain cortex]] ([[Alzheimer's disease]]), [[Robert Koch]] - creator of modern [[bacteriology]] ([[Nobel Prize]] in 1905), [[Paul Ehrlich]] - pioneer of present chemotherapy (Nobel Prize in 1908).\n\nAt present Wroc\u0142aw is an active centre of [[medical education]]. The process of teaching is realised by a team of highly qualified specialists. The Medical University also performs a wide range of scientific activities and provides the whole region of [[Lower Silesia]] with highly specialised medical care.\n\nHistorically, the city's strategic location between branches of the slow running [[Oder River]], which forms many islands in the area, was utilised in the [[Middle Ages]] when Wroc\u0142aw was turned into a fortress. In early modern times, the system of defence was expanded. It is seen now as fortifications, surrounding its historical centre of original architecture. At the end of the Second World War, 70% of the town was destroyed. A great effort was needed to restore and rebuild the university buildings.\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine is the oldest and largest faculty of Wroc\u0142aw Medical University. It was established on November 14, 1945, as one of the six faculties of Wroc\u0142aw's University and Technical University. The opening lecture was given by [[Ludwik Hirszfeld]]. The scientific staff consisted mainly of professors from the [[Jan Kazimierz University]] in Lvov. In 1950, the Wroc\u0142aw Medical University was established, consisting of the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Pharmacy. Since then, 16,068 medical doctors and 4,715 dentists have graduated. On February 12, 1958, Prof. Wiktor Bross was the first in Poland to perform [[open heart surgery]], which he did at the Faculty of Medicine, and on March 31, 1966, he performed the first kidney transplant from a living donor together with Prof. Wladyslaw Wrezlewicz. These achievements were significant in European medicine. A great number of prominent scientists have conducted research at the Faculty of Medicine, including Professors Ludwik Hirszfeld, Zygmunt Albert, Edward Szczeklik, [[Witold Or\u0142owski]], [[Stefan \u015alopek]]  and Hugon and Zofia Kowarzyk.\n\nTwo new faculties, the Faculty of Postgraduate Medical Training in 1992 and Faculty of Dentistry in 2000, were created based on the organisational structure and lecturing staff of the Faculty of Medicine. After these changes, the Faculty of Medicine assumed more of the educational duties of the University. In 2002 the faculty received the PE-EN ISO 9001 certificate for its educational and research programs in accordance with the standards defined by the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification.\n\n==Rectors==\n[[File:598777 Wroc\u0142aw, Collegium Anatomicum. 02.JPG|thumb|Collegium Anatomicum of the Wroc\u0142aw Medical University]]\n[[File:Wroc\u0142aw, O\u015brodek Badawczo\u2013Naukowo\u2013Dydaktyczny Dolno\u015bl\u0105skiej Farmacji - fotopolska.eu (210589).jpg|thumb|Pharmaceutical Research Center]]\n* [[Zygmunt Albert]] (1950\u20131954)\n* [[Antoni Falkiewicz]] (1954\u20131957)\n* [[Bogus\u0142aw Bobra\u0144ski]] (1957\u20131962)\n* [[Aleksander Klecze\u0144ski]] (1962\u20131965)\n* [[Tadeusz Baranowski (chemist)|Tadeusz Baranowski]] (1965\u20131968)\n* [[Leonard Kuczy\u0144ski]] (1968\u20131972)\n* [[Stanis\u0142aw Iwankiewicz]] (1972\u20131978)\n* [[Eugeniusz Rogalski]] (1978\u20131981)\n* [[Marian Wilimowski]] (1981\u20131987)\n* [[Bogdan \u0141azarkiewicz]] (1987\u20131990)\n* [[Zbigniew Kapnik]] (1990\u20131993)\n* [[Jerzy Czernik]] (1993\u20131999)\n* [[Leszek Paradowski]] (1999\u20132005)\n* [[Ryszard Andrzejak]] (2005-2011)\n* [[Marek Zi\u0119tek]] (2011\u2013present)\n\n== Faculties ==\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Dentistry\n* Faculty of Postgraduate Medical Training\n* Faculty of Pharmacy\n* Faculty of Health Science\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.am.wroc.pl/en/}}\n* [http://www.englishdivision.am.wroc.pl/ English Division of the university]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Universities in Poland}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wroclaw Medical University}}\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Category:Medical schools in Poland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox university\n|name        = Wroc\u0142aw Medical University\n|native_name = Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The following year, the president's house was constructed at the corner of Sheffield and Waveland.  In 1893, the seminary spent $25,000 to construct the four-story Eliza Hall housing the library, chapel, lecture and student rooms further to the west along Waveland.  By 1899, four homes were built for professors from the northwest corner of the block (at Waveland and Stella) stretching south along Stella.  The seminary had ambitious plans for expansion.  In 1905, it announced plans to build additional buildings on the southwest corner of the block housing dining halls, a gymnasium, and more lecture and student rooms, along with additional professors' homes on either side of Eliza Hall.  The buildings were to be arranged around a central quadrangle.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Plans for New Buildings\n | journal = The Chicago Lutheran Seminary Record\n | volume = 10\n | pages = 36\u201337\n | date = April 1905\n }}</ref>\n\nThe seminary, however, was attempting to flourish in the context of a changing community.  The extension of the [[Chicago 'L'|elevated]] system into the area in 1900 led to rapid development of the surrounding neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Addison (3600N/940W)\n | url = http://www.chicago-l.org/stations/addison-howard.html\n | accessdate = March 30, 2014}}</ref>  As the area started taking on an increasingly urban character, the seminary abandoned its plans to develop the site and instead sought to sell its land and find a quieter location.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, other developments were coming together to chart a very different future for this plot of land. As early as 1905, rumors had been swirling that minor-league [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] was seeking to locate a franchise in Chicago as part of a strategy to achieve [[Major League Baseball|major league]] status on par with the [[National League]] and the recently established [[American League]].  The [[Chicago]] market was one of the most lucrative in the country, and was already occupied by the NL's [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] and the AL's [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]]. Charles Havenor (owner of the AA [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]]), and brothers [[Joe Cantillon]] (manager of the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]]) and Mike Cantillon (owner of the AA [[Minneapolis Millers]]), saw an opportunity to make profit by snapping up choice property in the event that the AA decided to move into the Chicago market.  Since the White Sox played on the South Side at [[South Side Park]], and the Cubs were firmly ensconced on the West Side at [[West Side Park]], Havenor and the Cantillons looked to the rapidly developing North Side as the best place to situate a team. The seminary's location represented the best open land on the North Side. In 1909, the seminary, eager to move, sold the property to Havenor and the Cantillons for $175,000 and relocated to the suburb of [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], Illinois, where it remained until 1967.  Havenor and the Cantillons brought in additional investors in 1910, including E.T. Harmon and Edmund Archambault, wealthy [[Milwaukee]] businessmen.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Deveney| first1 = Sean\n | title = Before Wrigley Became Wrigley: The Inside Story of the First Years of the Cubs' Home Field\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Sports Publishing\n | pages = 9\u201312\n | date = 2014\n | isbn = 978-1-61321-648-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eliza Hall at Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|left|400px|A close-up view of Eliza Hall (\"Students Building\") and the professors residences from the same series of postcards as seen from Waveland Avenue.]]\n\nThe new owners had intended to keep the sale out of the news, but those plans were foiled when members of the seminary board complained that the seminary could have obtained $200,000 in the sale.  Havenor was forced to publicly deny any intention on invading the Chicago market.  Other AA team owners got cold feet at the prospect of a war with the major leagues, and elected a president that was unwilling to countenance such a scheme.  Over the next couple years, Havenor gradually gave up hope of developing the property, selling out his interest to the remaining investors shortly before his death in April 1912.  The former seminary site was not developed any further, and the former seminary buildings were converted into residential units.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Deveney| first1 = Sean\n | title = Before Wrigley Became Wrigley: The Inside Story of the First Years of the Cubs' Home Field\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Sports Publishing\n | pages = 12\u201317\n | date = 2014\n | isbn = 978-1-61321-648-4}}</ref>\n\n==Weeghman Park and the Federal League (1913\u20131915)==\n[[File:Weeghman Park Construction.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Construction of Weeghman Park, early April 1914.]]\nThe [[Federal League]] began its existence as a minor league in 1913, locating franchises in six cities, including Chicago. The Chicago franchise, known as the Chi-Feds, played its home games at the baseball grounds at [[DePaul University]].\n\nJohn T. Powers, founder and president of the new Federal League, had ambitions of building the new organization into a premier minor league, on par with the American Association. By the middle of the 1913 season, however, the owners had forced Powers out of his job, sensing that the Federal League had the potential to become a viable major league. Replacing him as president was James A. Gilmore, a wealthy Chicago businessman who had made his fortune in coal. Gilmore had the organizational and political skills necessary to mount a serious challenge to the established major leagues.\n\nGilmore brought on board two partners to control the key Chicago franchise. One was William Walker, a fish wholesaler. The other was the flamboyant [[Charles Weeghman|Charles A. Weeghman]], known as \"Lucky Charlie\", who had made a quick fortune in local lunch counters (a predecessor to [[fast food]]). Weeghman became the club president and the main force behind the team from that point onward, with Walker willing to remain in the background, and Gilmore tending to League issues. Weeghman made headlines by landing star shortstop [[Joe Tinker]] from the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in December 1913. The Tinker acquisition was the shot in the arm that gave the franchise the momentum to think big for the upcoming 1914 season.\n\n[[File:Weeghman Park Outfield April 1914.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A view of the Weeghman Park outfield taken in April 1914.  Note the former seminary buildings beyond the fence, the original location of the scoreboard in left field, and the \"jury box\" bleachers in right-center field.  Compare this image with the picture below taken from the same vantage point in 1915.]]\n\nWeeghman chose to relocate the franchise from DePaul to the former seminary grounds at Clark and Addison owned by Archambault and the Cantillons. Although the major leagues threw up a number of roadblocks, including an attempt to secure rights to part of the land on the block, in late December 1913 Weeghman secured a ninety-nine year lease on the property. The lease stipulated, among other things, that improvements on the property could not exceed $70,000. Within several months, however, Weeghman would spend several times that amount in erecting his new ballpark.\n\nWeeghman hired [[Zachary Taylor Davis]], architect of [[Comiskey Park]] (which became the home of the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] in June 1910), to design the new ballpark. Weeghman wanted the park to rival the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City|New York]], but in the end the single-decked grandstand as designed bore little resemblance to it.\n\n[[File:1914 Weeghman Park left field.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Weeghman Park, May 1914.  Note Eliza Hall beyond the left-field fence.  During the park's first three games in April 1914, the original fence proved too inviting to batters, leading the team to move it back during the next road trip.  Relocating the fence necessitated demolition of a porch on Eliza Hall - note the discoloration where the porch had been attached.  That building was demolished altogether shortly before the 1915 season and replaced with bleachers.]]\n\nWork on the property didn't begin until February 23, 1914, exactly two months before the Chi-Feds' scheduled home opener. After the grounds had been cleared, groundbreaking ceremonies took place on March 4. Under the guidance of the Blome-Sinek company, the lead construction contractor, the park came together over the remainder of March and the first half of April. Despite a brief strike by construction workers in early April, the new park was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.<ref>{{cite news | title=Seminary gave way to Cub faithful | work=Chicago Tribune | date=March 30, 2014 | author=Hageman, William | location=A | page=14}}</ref>\n\nThe new ballpark, known as Weeghman Park, was a modern steel and concrete baseball plant (in the industrial lexicon of the day). It featured a single-decked grandstand sweeping from right field behind home plate to near the left field corner. Perched on top of the grandstand roof behind home plate was a small area for the press.\n\nA modern-day visitor to the original Weeghman Park would have difficulty recognizing the outfield aside from the familiar buildings on the opposite side of Waveland and Sheffield Avenues (which haven't changed much at all). The dimensions of the original playing field along the foul lines were quite short. The distance from home plate to the right field brick fence along Sheffield Avenue was around 300 feet at the foul line. Left field was not much better, partly because several old seminary buildings stood between the wooden left field fence and Waveland Avenue. The left field fence also featured a large scoreboard. Like most of the parks of the day, the field was essentially angular, as it was shaped by the surrounding grid street pattern. The right and left field walls converged in a corner in deep center field, nearly 450 feet from home plate. Because of the constricted size of much of the outfield near the corners, bleachers were limited to a small jury box in right-center field. All told, Weeghman Park had a [[seating capacity]] of 14,000, but this was frequently exceeded by the many standing room only crowds of the day.\n\n[[File:Weeghman Park 1915.jpg|thumb|left|250px|New left field bleachers at Weeghman Park, 1915. Note the scoreboard has now been moved to center field.  These bleachers occupied the former site of Eliza Hall.]]\n\nAfter an unusual number of home runs were hit during the Chi-Feds' first home series against Kansas City in April, Weeghman decided the left field wall was too cozy a target, and had the entire fence moved back some 25 feet. To do this, the front porch had to be removed from the old seminary building beyond the wall.\n\nBefore the start of the 1915 season, Weeghman made additional changes to the outfield. Gone were the jury-box bleachers in right-center field. The old seminary buildings beyond left field were finally demolished in March. In their place, Weeghman had wooden bleachers erected from the left-field corner to center field, raising the park's capacity to roughly 18,000. The scoreboard was relocated to center field, where it has remained in one form or another since then (with the exception of the latter part of the 1937 season during construction of the current bleachers).\n\nOn the field, the Chi-Feds were renamed the [[Chicago Whales]] for the club's sophomore season. Weeghman Park was fast becoming the best place to watch baseball in Chicago, as the Whales fought their way to the Federal League pennant in one of the closest races in major league history. Additionally, fans enjoyed Weeghman's high standards for cleanliness and promotion. He was an early champion of Ladies' Day (every Friday) and in 1916 would become the first baseball owner to allow fans to keep foul balls. And as a successful restaurateur, his food was top-notch. Long before the Wrigley family entered the scene, the park was already famous for its hospitality.\n\nDespite the exciting pennant race and generally high quality of baseball played in the Federal League, the League was hemorrhaging money. In December 1915, the League capitulated to the other major leagues and disbanded. But all was not lost for Weeghman, however. He was allowed to purchase the Cubs franchise for $500,000, and promptly moved his new club out of the dilapidated West Side Park and into his Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. The purchase was in reality a merger between the Whales and the Cubs, as a number of former Whales stars, such as Max Flack and Claude Hendrix, found themselves playing in the same park as Cubs the following season.\n\n[[File:Weeghman Park Panorama 1915.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Weeghman Park, home of the [[Federal League]] champion [[Chicago Whales]], as seen from Sheffield Avenue, in 1915. With the park now occupying all the land right up to Waveland Avenue, its left field area is substantially larger than it was the previous year, as is apparent from the considerable distance between the end of the left-field grandstand and the left-field corner.  For comparison, see the above picture taken from the same vantage point in 1914.]]\n\n==Weeghman Park to Cubs Park to Wrigley Field (1916\u20131932)==\n[[File:Max Flack Cubs 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cubs right fielder [[Max Flack]] in front of original short right field wall, c. 1920. Note the [[Doublemint]] \"elves\" atop the scoreboard, and the [[Wilson Sporting Goods]] sign on the right field wall.]]\n\nThe Cubs played their first game at Weeghman Park on April 20, 1916, besting the [[Cincinnati Reds]] 7\u20136 in eleven innings. This proved to be the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable season. After another year in the bottom half of the standings, the Cubs won the National League pennant in 1918 under manager [[Fred Mitchell (baseball)|Fred Mitchell]]. The victory was not without a little outside help, as wartime conditions during the height of American involvement in [[World War I]] caused major league baseball to end the regular season on September 1. With the Cubs struggling for cash, Weeghman reluctantly rented the larger capacity [[Comiskey Park]] for the Cubs' home games in the [[1918 World Series|World Series]]. For the Cubs, the experience was a bust, as the club lost the series to [[Babe Ruth]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in six games to relatively anemic attendance. Such losses may have provided the final push forcing Charlie Weeghman out of management following the season.\n\nAlthough Weeghman was clearly the most dominant figure in the revamped Cubs organization in 1916, a number of investors had taken up minority shares in the club. One of the new investors was [[chewing gum]] magnate [[William Wrigley Jr.|William Wrigley]]. Over the next couple years, as Weeghman's financial fortunes off the field entered a sharp decline, Wrigley acquired an increasing number of shares in the club and took on a growing role in the team's affairs. In November 1918, Weeghman gave up his remaining interest to Wrigley, resigned as president, and left baseball for good. Wrigley would acquire complete control of the Cubs by 1921.\n\nWith Weeghman out of the picture, starting in 1919 the park was generally referred to as Cubs Park. Although the Cubs featured stars such as pitchers [[Grover Cleveland Alexander|Grover Alexander]] and [[Hippo Vaughn]], along with a young catcher named [[Gabby Hartnett]], over the next few seasons Cubs Park was the setting for largely also-ran teams.\n\nThe fans had even more to be frustrated about off the field. Rumors of thrown games plagued the Cubs during the latter part of the 1920 season gave impetus to the criminal investigations which eventually led to uncovering the infamous [[Black Sox Scandal]] across town with the White Sox. In addition, 1920 marked the beginning of prohibition, meaning fans would have to find some other way to quench their thirst during the many hot summer afternoons at Cubs Park.\n\nAlthough the Cubs teams of the early 1920s were little more than also-rans, the fans still flocked to Cubs Park. In 1922, 542,283 fans went through the turnstiles\u2014the second-highest attendance in the National League\u2014to watch a fourth-place club.\n\n===Major renovations (1922\u201323)===\n\n[[File:Cubs Park Rendering 1922.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Aerial rendering of the proposed expansion of Cubs Park, circa 1922.]]\n\nBy 1922, William Wrigley had decided that after nine seasons, both the seating and the playing field of cozy Cubs Park were ready for a major expansion. Rather than rebuilding the grandstand from scratch, Wrigley hired original architect Zachary Taylor Davis to make the expansion around the existing structure. The grandstand would be sliced into three pieces, with the home plate section placed on rollers and moved roughly 60 feet west (away from right field), and the left field section about 100 feet northwest. Both gaps were to be filled in with more seating, resulting in a significantly longer grandstand and the noticeable \"dog leg\" shape of the stands on the first base side visible to this day. Additionally, the foul ground and the height of the fence in front of it would be reduced by additional rows of box seats added in front of the existing grandstand. The diamond and the foul lines would be rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise from their earlier orientation, allowing for those extra box seats. Home plate was moved with the center section of the original grandstand; in the current configuration, the original location is in the vicinity of the first base coaches box.\n\nThe relocation of the grandstand would make right field far more spacious than before, even with the addition of new bleachers in right field from the corner to the center field scoreboard. The old wooden bleachers in left field were to be dismantled and replaced with newer steel-framed wooden seats like those being installed in right field. The renovations would boost the park's capacity from roughly 18,000 to 31,000. Its dimensions would be roughly 320 feet in left field, 318 in right, and 446 feet to straightaway center.\n\n[[File:Relocation of Cubs Park grandstand 1922-23.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Cubs Park grandstand, seen from the corner of Clark and Addision, divided into three segments during the 1922-23 expansion, prior to the construction of additional sections between the relocated segments.  Note that, in the days before the famous marquee was installed, the ballpark was identified by a sign along the top of the grandstand reading \"Chicago National League Baseball Club.\"]]\n\nWork on the renovations began in December 1922 and were completed in time for the 1923 season opener. The changes were of such magnitude that many publications of the time referred to the \"new\" Cubs Park. Fans flocked to the park, and attendance shot up to 703,705 for the 1923 season, although this was once again only good for second-best in the National League. On the field, however, the Cubs remained also-rans. The team drifted aimlessly through the middle of the standings in 1923 and '24. By 1925, the Cubs found themselves commemorating their fiftieth season in the National League by finishing last for the first time (which in 1925 meant eighth place).\n\nThe recently renovated Cubs Park, while a hit with the fans, was not without its critics. Their main objection was that the new left field bleachers were simply too easy a target for right-handed hitters. By late July and early August 1925, reporters were frequently griping about games lost to fly balls which would have been easy outs without the left field bleachers. During the Cubs' first road trip that month, the half of the left field bleachers closest to the foul line was dismantled, leaving a \"jury box\" of seats running from deep left-center to the center field scoreboard. The change cost the Cubs over a thousand seats, although that left-field area was sometimes filled with standing-room-only spectators behind ropes, as was the custom of the day. With the left field line now at a substantial 364 feet from home plate, home run production dropped.\n\n===Double decking the grandstand (1927\u201328)===\n[[File:Wrigley Field split upper deck 1927.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The upper deck of the newly rechristened Wrigley Field remained unfinished throughout the 1927 season, extending only along the third base line.]]\nBy 1926, the Cubs were benefiting handily from the peak of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Nearly 900,000 fans went through the turnstiles at a park with a capacity of just over 30,000. After the close of the season, work began on adding a second deck to the grandstand. The original idea was to have the job completed by the opening of the 1927 season, but by April, only the third-base side of the upper deck had been completed, temporarily giving the park a startlingly asymmetrical appearance.\n\nCubs Park was formally renamed Wrigley Field prior to the start of the 1927 season.\n\nDespite the half-finished state of the upper deck expansion, the 1927 Cubs drew over 1.1 million fans, becoming the first National League team ever to do so. In addition to the increased capacity of the park, the Cubs helped their own cause by becoming an increasingly competitive team under manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]].\n\nThe upper deck was finally completed in time for the 1928 season, which saw the Cubs break the million mark in attendance yet again. The timing couldn't have been more fortuitous. In 1929, the Cubs put together one of the most potent lineups in major league history, and easily walked to the National League pennant with stars like [[Hack Wilson]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[Kiki Cuyler]], [[Charlie Root]] and [[Pat Malone]]. Season attendance soared to nearly 1.5 million fans. This would remain the major league record for seventeen years, a record aided in large part by declining major league attendance during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. The Cubs themselves would not top this mark for another forty years.\n\nAs the World Series approached, Wrigley sought to provide even more seating at the park. He contracted to have temporary wooden bleachers erected on both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, raising the park's capacity to roughly 50,000. Both streets were closed to traffic. In the end, the bleachers were only needed for games one and two of the [[1929 World Series]], both of which the Cubs lost on their way to a five-game defeat at the hands of the underdog [[Philadelphia Athletics]].\n\nBy the early 1930s, distance markers were posted: left field line, 364 feet; left-center against the outer wall, 372; left center, corner of bleachers, 364; deep center field corner, 440; right center, 354; right field line, 321.\n\nDuring the 1968\u20131970 off-seasons, the concrete in the upper deck was stripped and replaced. After 40 years of harsh Chicago winters, the original concrete was showing signs of wear and tear; it was replaced with precast concrete installed over the 1927 steel framework.<ref>Chicago Tribune, January 31, 1969 pC1</ref> In 2004, nearly 40 years later, this precast concrete itself began to show deterioration as several chunks of the precast concrete fell, leading to increased safety inspections and the installation of protective netting.<ref>Chicago Tribune, December 22, 2004</ref>\n\n==\"Beautiful Wrigley Field\" (1932\u20131981)==\n\n===Construction of the bleachers (1937)===\nWrigley Field is known for the [[Parthenocissus tricuspidata|Boston ivy]] (''Parthenocissus tricuspidata'') planted against the outfield wall in 1937 by [[Bill Veeck]], whose father had been team president until his 1933 death. If the ball is hit into and lost in the ivy, then it is ruled a [[ground rule double|ground-rule double]], provided that the defensive outfielder raises his hands to signify that the ball has been lost in the ivy; if the player attempts to search for the ball, the play is considered live, and no ground-rule double is ruled. Wrigley is also known for the manual scoreboard Veeck also erected. No batted ball has ever hit the scoreboard; indeed, very few home runs have even landed in the \"upper deck\" of the center field bleachers. However, [[Sam Snead]] did manage to hit the big board with a golf ball teed off from home plate, on April 17, 1951, just prior to the Cubs home opener.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/chc/history/timeline07.jsp |title=Cubs Timeline &#124; cubs.com: History |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, the Cubs announced plans to rebuild the bleachers in concrete instead of wood, to be fronted by brick that would soon be covered in ivy, and to build a new scoreboard. To make the outfield look more symmetrical and graceful, the plans called for extending the left field bleachers to a point closer to the corner. The gentle curves between the ends of the left and right field bleachers would become popularly known as the \"wells\". That summer, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' ran a series of articles about major league ballparks, and the writer sharply criticized the Cubs for a remodeling that he suspected would result in too many \"cheap\" home runs. The writer later retracted when he saw that the final plan was ''somewhat'' more spacious than originally announced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBe that as it may, construction went on behind a temporary fence during the summer, and the finished product was unveiled on September 4, in time for the last month of the season. Bill Veeck's famous ivy was planted not long after, but it would be another year before it fully took hold. According to his own autobiography, ''Veeck as in Wreck'', he planted [[Celastrus|Bittersweet]], which would grow quickly, and also the more famous Boston ivy, which would eventually take over. Another part of the arboretum was to be a series of Chinese elms on the large \"stairsteps\" up to the scoreboard, as well as one apiece in the little triangle at the top of each \"well\". According to Veeck's biography, that plan did not fare so well as the winds kept blowing the leaves off. Management finally gave up \"after about twenty tries\", so the trees are long gone, leaving just the large bare steps and (until 2006) the little flat triangular supports at the tops of the \"wells\". According to Veeck, the trees themselves were inexpensive, but the special construction for them in the bleachers cost about $200,000.\n\n[[File:Wrigley Field 1935.JPG|thumb|right|190px|Wrigley Field seen from above during the [[1935 World Series]].  This was one of three times prior to 2005 that the Cubs erected temporary bleachers over the Waveland and Sheffield sidewalks.  The other occasions were the [[1929 World Series|1929]] and [[1932 World Series]].]]\n\nAnother mistake was constructing bleachers in straightaway center field: The batters could easily lose sight of the ball in the white shirts worn by spectators on sunny days, because the wall was not high enough to provide a full [[Batter's eye|batter's background]] by itself. Various methods were tried to get around this. At one time a flat canopy was extended over the area, to try to put the spectators in shadow, but that was ineffective (the 2005\u20132006 reconstruction would to some extent revisit that concept). For a while in the mid-1960s, a screen was attached to the top of the wall and the ivy twined its way up. Batters and bleacher fans disliked it, and it was removed after a couple of seasons. Later, for a number of years, a green tarp covered those seats.\n\nAfter generally being closed to spectators sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the last time those three problem sections were used for baseball was during the 1962 All-Star game. The seats continued to be used for other events such as football and soccer, during the years when the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[Chicago Sting]] played their games here.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wrigley Field Sign.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Wrigley Field sign on W. Addison St., Chicago]] -->\nBy the 1990s, the area was occupied by juniper plants, which nicely complemented the ivy. Also, the layout was tweaked a bit, to open up a few seats on either side of the straight center field area while still providing a rectangular background from the perspective of the batter.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, the plants were temporarily removed during reconstruction (see below). Over the following winter, a lounge was constructed in the upper part of this area and new rows of juniper bushes were placed in the lower part.\n\nBy the end of 1937, the dimensions were set: 355&nbsp;feet to the left field corner, a few feet ''behind'' where the corner wall tangents the foul pole; 368 to fairly deep left-center; 400 to the deepest part of center (at the right edge of the batters background area); 368 to right center; and 353 to the right field foul pole. There are other intriguing distances that have never been posted. In the original ''Encyclopedia of Baseball'', by Hy Turkin and S.C. Thompson, 1951, measurements of 357 feet to the left field \"well\" and 363 to the right field \"well\" were revealed. That would put the closest point of the left end of the bleachers no more than about 350 feet from home plate, a fact many pitchers have cursed over the years. Left-center in general is shallow. Straightaway center is probably about 390. Deep center and the right field area in general are better balanced. But the shallowness of the left-center power alley, really too cozy for major league standards, and the resultant increase in home runs in the decades since 1937, suggest that the ''Chicago Tribune's'' original skeptical assessment was correct.\n\nThe \"basket\", an angling chain-link fence that runs along the top of the outfield wall, was installed at the start of the 1970 season. During the 1969 pennant race, there were several incidents of fans interfering with fly balls and even falling onto the field. There was also the first and only incident of a fan running the field and escaping without prosecution.  A famous photograph was taken of the incident and published in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imgur.com/Wa79lR8 |title=the simple image sharer |publisher=imgur |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>  The basket was intended to deter or prevent that kind of problem. Security cameras were also installed at that time. The \"basket\" angles away from the wall, and is also higher than the wall in order to provide some balance for the pitchers. However, over the years a number of baseballs have been hit \"into the basket\" for home runs that previously would have been outs, or off the wall, or possibly interfered with by fans. The basket only exists where there is seating. During the 1980s, when the bleacher seating was extended over the \"catwalks\", i.e. the bleacher ramps in extreme left and right fields, the basket was likewise extended.\n\n===First attempt at lights (1941)===\nLights were scheduled to be added to Wrigley Field in 1942, but after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], then-owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] (son of the late William) donated the necessary materials to the war effort. Founded by P.K. Wrigley, the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] (known for the first half of the 1943 season as the All-American Girls Softball League) began their inaugural season of play in the spring of 1943. On the evening of July 1, 1943, teams from the All-American League played an exhibition game at Wrigley Field as part of a Women's Army Corps (WAC) recruiting rally, attracting approximately 7,000 fans. With temporary lighting set up behind home plate along the first and third base lines, this would be the first night game to be played at Wrigley Field. The All-American Girls Baseball League would play the second ever night game at Wrigley the following year in another war drive exhibition.\n\nBaseball boomed after the war, allowing P. K. Wrigley to procrastinate on the issue of permanent lighting. He eventually decided ''never'' to install lights for a variety of publicly stated reasons, so Wrigley Field remained a bastion of day baseball until the [[Tribune Company|Chicago Tribune Company]] era, which began in 1981; the first night game with permanent lighting was not until 1988. \n[[File:Bob-horsch-wrigley-field-panoramic.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Chicago Cubs vs Boston Red Sox - Interleague play in June 2005]]\n[[File:Wrigley-Panorama.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Panoramic view of Wrigley Field]]\n[[File:Wrigley-para3.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Panoramic view of Wrigley field in 2008]]\n\n==\"Building a New Tradition in the Friendly Confines\" (1981\u2013present)==\n\n===Night baseball (1988)===\n[[File:WrigleyBartmanNight.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Wrigleyville under the lights during game 6 of the [[2003 National League Championship Series|2003 NLCS]]]]\nThe Cubs had been run almost like a hobby by the Wrigleys, but the Tribune Company was interested in the Cubs strictly as a business. The new owners started talking  lights and began stirring debate on the matter. One of P. K. Wrigley's stated reasons for not installing lights was that it would upset the neighborhood, and the initial negative reaction to the Tribune Company's intentions validated P. K.'s prediction.\n\nResistance to the installation of lights was not limited to those who lived nearby and opposed the lights on the practical grounds of bothersome brightness or the noise and crowds from night games. Many Cubs fans who lived outside Wrigleyville opposed the idea simply due to the fact that the Cubs' stance as the last team to resist night baseball was a point of pride, as it was seen as a vestige of baseball's heritage as a pastoral game, played in natural sunlight. Some Cubs fans also had fond associations with [[Gabby Hartnett|Gabby Hartnett's]] famous \"Homer in the Gloaming,\" in which Hartnett hit a crucial home run in the bottom of the ninth of a game on the verge of being called for darkness, helping the Cubs to win the 1938 pennant.\n\nThe City of Chicago had passed an ordinance banning night events at Wrigley Field, due to its presence in the residential [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] neighborhood, so Tribune was unable to install lights unless the ordinance was repealed. They compromised by scheduling a significant number of 3:00 starts, which typically carried games into the evening but did not require lights for games that completed within three hours or so.\n\nThis debate continued for several years, and became more intense as the Cubs returned to competitiveness during the early 1980s. When the Cubs won the [[National League Eastern Division]] title in 1984, then-commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] announced that the Cubs would lose [[home field advantage]] should they advance to the [[1984 World Series|World Series]] (home field advantage alternated between the champions of the [[National League]] and [[American League]] until 2003), since by this time nearly all World Series games were played at night in the Eastern and Central time zones. After winning their two scheduled home (day) games in the [[1984 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], the Cubs lost all three games in San Diego, so Kuhn's threat became moot. But the following year, new commissioner [[Peter Ueberroth]] announced that because Wrigley Field had no lights, the Cubs would have to play ''all'' future postseason games at another ballpark, likely [[Comiskey Park]], [[Soldier Field]], or possibly even St. Louis' [[Busch Stadium II|Busch Stadium]], or [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The Cubs fell out of contention for the next several years, however, and the possibility of playing post-season \"home\" games in other cities did not arise.\n\nThe Cubs, under team president [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]], quickly changed the issue from lights or no lights to Wrigley Field or move out of town. With typical bluntness, Green said, \"if there are no lights in Wrigley Field, ''there will be no Wrigley Field.''\" Green seriously considered shuttering Wrigley and playing at Comiskey Park as tenants of the White Sox for a year, in hopes that the neighborhood would feel the loss of revenue and back down. The Cubs also explored moving to several suburban locations, including a site adjacent to [[Arlington Park]] in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]] and another in [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]]. There was even talk of a drastic move which involved selling the stadium to local college [[DePaul University]], who would likely tear down Wrigley Field to host its indoor sports or convert it to a full-time football stadium in hopes of returning football to the campus. The Cubs would then likely build a new ballpark near the Rosemont Horizon (now the [[Allstate Arena]], where DePaul plays its home games currently) in suburban [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]].\n\nThe Cubs' new stance quickly changed the context of the debate, as even the most adamant opponents of adding lights didn't want to see the Cubs leave for the suburbs. Schaumburg officials were so convinced that the Cubs were actually coming that land was purchased by investors hoping to build a new ballpark off the [[Elgin-O'Hare Expressway]] west of [[Interstate 355|I-355]]. When the Cubs and the city of Chicago came to an agreement to keep the team on the North Side, the site spawned a ballpark anyway, with field dimensions and shape identical to Wrigley Field, even mimicking the \"wells\" along the outfield wall, and the 'dogleg' in the visitor's dugout along the first base line. That stadium, [[Boomers Stadium]] (formerly known as Alexian Field), is now home to the (non-affiliated) minor league [[Schaumburg Boomers]].\n\nIn the fall of 1987, Chicago mayor [[Harold Washington]] proposed a compromise ordinance to the Chicago City Council which allowed the Cubs to install lights, but limited the number of night games. Washington died a week after the compromise was proposed, but the city eventually approved a compromise in February 1988 under interim mayor [[Eugene Sawyer]]. [[Major League Baseball]] responded by awarding the Cubs the [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1990 All-Star Game]].\n\n[[File:Wrigley Sheffield bleachers 070602.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Lights, bleacher expansion, and exterior ivy]]\nThe first major league night game at Wrigley was attempted on August 8 against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], but was rained out after 3\u00bd innings. During the rain delay, several Cubs players, imitating a scene in the recent film hit, ''[[Bull Durham]]'', played \"slip-and-slide\" on the tarp. One source says the group included [[Greg Maddux]], [[Al Nipper]], [[Les Lancaster]] and [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]]. Manager [[Don Zimmer]] was not amused, and they were fined $500 apiece.\n\nThe first official night game was played the following night, August 9 against the [[New York Mets]] (in front of a nationally televised audience watching [[Vin Scully]] and [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] call the game on [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]), ending a streak of 5,687 consecutive home day games. However, this was not the first night game of ''any'' kind at Wrigley, as in the 1940s, some [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League|AAGPBL]] night games were played in Wrigley Field using temporary lighting structures; specifically, the All-Star Game held in July 1943, was the first night baseball game there, according to the Lowry book and the movie ''[[A League of Their Own]]''.\n\nStarting with their first full season with lights, in 1989, as part of the compromise with the city, the Cubs were limited to 18 night games within their 81-game regular season schedule, plus any post-season games that might have to be played at night for TV scheduling reasons. The timing of the lights' installation proved fortuitous, as the Cubs reached the post-season in 1989. Their first two post-season night games were the first two games of the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], on October 4 and 5. They lost the first game against the [[San Francisco Giants]] 11\u20133, and won the second game 9\u20135.\n\nThe Cubs' post-season appearances since 1988 (as well as their one-game regular-season playoff with San Francisco in 1998) have featured mostly night games, the exceptions (as of 2007) being the fourth game of their [[2003 National League Division Series|2003 NLDS]] matchup with the Atlanta Braves and third game of the [[2007 National League Division Series|2007 NLDS]] against the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of which were Saturday afternoon contests.\n\nIn recent years, the Cubs have successfully lobbied for additional regular-season night games (up to a potential 30 per year, as of 2007). However, per their agreement with the city, they still play most of their games during the day. Due to the limited night schedule, night games at Wrigley Field are considered an \"event\" and are almost always sold out well in advance. Some observers compare the atmosphere of a Wrigley Field night game to that of [[Rush Street (Chicago)|Rush]] and [[Division Street|Division]] streets, the longtime epicenter of Chicago's nightclub scene.\n\nWrigley Field has continuously evolved over its 90-plus seasons. There is relatively little left of the original that is visible to the casual viewer. One of the more obvious originals were the brick portions of the outer bleacher wall, visible in the \"back of Wrigley Field\" photo. The Cubs' bleacher expansion resulted in removal of those bricks, which were later sold to the public individually at a \"garage sale\" at the start of the 2006 season.\n\n===Bleacher expansion and renovation (2005\u20132006)===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Wrigley Waveland bleachers 070602.JPG\n| width1 = 156\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = 2005\u20132006 bleacher expansion<br>extending over sidewalk.\n| image2 = BLBleachers.jpg\n| width2 = 125\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Remodeled bleacher<br>entrance\n| footer = \n}}\n[[File:20070616 Chris Young visits Wrigley (4)-edit3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Chris Young (baseball pitcher)|Chris Young]] in the [[bullpen]] located in playable foul territory, with remodeled center field area in background.]]\nAfter lengthy debate, the reconstruction and expansion of the bleachers (by some 1,900 seats) finally began after the close of the 2005 season, although it was strongly opposed by Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley|Richard Daley]]. The first part of the process was to remove the outer brick wall, one of the last vestiges of the 1914 structure. Additionally, much of the 1937 construction behind the inner ivy-covered wall was removed (except for the steel supports and the center field upper tier) and the former sidewalk was excavated. The work progressed quickly throughout the winter, aided by the relatively mild Midwestern January.\n\nThe original concept called for the bleachers to simply extend out over the sidewalks, supported by open steel columns in cantilevered design, connecting new steel to the existing steel that supported the old bleachers. That plan was altered somewhat when it was feared the area would become an impromptu homeless shelter. Thus the vertical part of the supporting structure for the new bleachers was encased in a wall constructed of new bricks, in a style reminiscent of the original wall, and the sidewalk (repaved in brick) became a few feet narrower. The only part hanging over the sidewalk is the flat walkway behind the bleachers. The upper part of the formerly vacant center field area is occupied by a large luxury suite, fronted by darkened, slanted windows so as not to interfere with the batters' sight lines, and the lower part by juniper plants that had been temporarily removed. Another notable change to the configuration was to replace the solid door in the right field corner with a chain-link fence gate, so passers-by can see part of the ballfield (an idea borrowed from [[Oracle Park]]).\n\nVarious Internet sites displayed photos tracking the progress of construction. The results support what management had stated, that the changes would not depart radically from the previous structure.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ed |first=Easy |url=http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/section/Bleacher-Photos |title=2005-06 Bleacher Reconstruction Project - Bleed Cubbie Blue - For Chicago Cubs Fans |publisher=Bleed Cubbie Blue |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=CubsNet.com |url=http://www.cubsnet.com/node/731 |title=Wrigley Field bleachers renovation work photos |publisher=CubsNet.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wgntv.trb.com/sports/baseball/cubs/wgntv-sports-040606-cubsgallery,0,7294415.photogallery?index=1 |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622163606/http://wgntv.trb.com/sports/baseball/cubs/wgntv-sports-040606-cubsgallery%2C0%2C7294415.photogallery?index=1 |archivedate=June 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 2006, the Cubs announced the bleachers would be renamed the [[Bud Light]] bleachers.

Conventional Boston ivy was planted on the east-facing Sheffield wall, which gets a fair amount of sunlight during morning hours. The north-facing wall along Waveland, which receives little direct sunlight in the summer and none in the winter, was to have an \"evergreen\" variety, English ivy, which thrives in shade.\n\nThe bleacher expansion project was designed by HOK Architecture, of Kansas City Missouri with Osborn Engineering of Cleveland, Ohio serving as the engineer.\n\nOn January 4, 2008 the Cubs got permission to add 80 new seats to the ballpark. The Cubs also got permission to add new signs. Wrigley Field will now hold up to 41,198 people after adding the seats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Giving Wrigley a new Field (2007\u20132008)===\n[[File:Wrigley Turf Replacement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The turf replacement in progress through Wrigley's right field fan window.]]\n[[File:Wrigley Turf Replacement After.jpg|thumb|right|200px|After view of the turf replacement.]]\nAt the end of the Cubs' 2007 season, two different efforts were undertaken to upgrade the playing field at the old ballpark. A few years earlier, a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll found that the players considered Wrigley's playing field to be one of the poorest in the Major Leagues. The renovations should go a long way toward fixing that situation.\n\nFirst, as reported on the Cubs official website<ref>{{cite web|author=Carrie Muskat |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071006&content_id=2253722&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |title=Notes: Field tested, and approved &#124; cubs.com: News |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> and also reported and pictured in the November issue of ''Chicago Cubs Vine Line'', the Cubs official fan magazine (p.&nbsp;4), the outfield and portions of the infield were replaced by turf purchased from an Oswego, Illinois, firm. This was accomplished in the 13 days between the last home regular season game and the first (and last, as it turned out) post-season game for the year. The project was supervised by Roger Bossard, who is the head groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThen, following the post-season, as reported on the Cubs website<ref>{{cite web|author=Carrie Muskat |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071116&content_id=2301854&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |title=Wrigley renovations near completion &#124; cubs.com: News |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> and also reported and pictured in the December issue of ''Vine Line'' <!--(p.5)-->, a more ambitious project began, to install a state-of-the-art drainage system. The entire playing surface at Wrigley was removed, which required digging down {{convert|14 to 28|in|cm}}. The underlying base material was replaced by a system of {{convert|6000|ft}} of piping buried in a special clay. The drainage system capable of holding 60,000 gallons of water was installed, on top of which a new playing surface of Colorado-grown sod was unrolled. This renovation, replacing a system installed in 1935, makes Wrigley the last Major League field to move away from a crown-based water management system. The infield had been at a somewhat raised elevation relative to the shallow part of the outfield and the far edge of the foul ground around the infield, hence the gutters in front of the box seat railings.\n\nAs of 2008, the infield now sits lower than it did, by {{convert|14|in|cm}}, eliminating the slight downhill slope that runners had to contend with upon rounding third base, and also allowing the managers in the dugouts to see the opposite-field outfielder in full, not just his \"top half\". The system allows for much shorter rain delays, while also controlling the flow of water toward the storm sewers. The ballpark sits on a block that has a noticeable downhill slope from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. The left field (northwest) corner of the playing field is several feet below street level. The natural drainage direction is toward the right field (southeast) corner, and the new system directs all the water through an outlet under the right field corner.\n\nAs part of the excavation, the crew found and removed the foundations of the goal posts from the Bears' playing days. The crew also reported that they left a \"time capsule\" buried somewhere under the new turf. Lowering the infield by {{convert|14|in|cm}} also effectively raises the outfield barrier by {{convert|14|in|cm}}, from the standpoint of the batter. It remains to be seen whether that factor will have any effect on home run production.\n\n===Will it remain Wrigley Field? (2007\u20132008)===\nTribune owner [[Sam Zell]] announced that he would consider selling the naming rights for Wrigley Field<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-fri_wrigley_1221dec21,1,5493626.story?ctrack=1&cset=true |title=Potential Wrigley purchase by state holds up Cubs sale |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2012 }} {{Dead link|date=August 2015|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> in order to help reduce the [[Tribune Company]]'s $13 billion debt.

Ricketts]] in 2009, further improvements to the park were developed, including construction of the long-discussed \"triangle building\" immediately to the west of the park at the intersection of Clark Street and Waveland Avenue, which would house some of the team's offices as well as a retail concourse and weight room for the players. Ricketts has also stated, \"We don't have any naming-rights discussions going on at all. I think Wrigley is the name we are going to go with.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Upgrades in the plan for Wrigley Field|date=October 30, 2009|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=DeLuca, Chris}}</ref>\n\n===Daktronics video screens and bleacher reconstruction (2014\u20132017)===\nIn October 2014 demolition began on a 3-year renovation project under the ownership of Ricketts. Bleacher expansion, a pair of Daktronics video boards in left and right field, and five outfield signs were slated to debut by Opening Day 2015, but were hampered by winter weather, and construction extended well into the 2015 season. With the city of Chicago vacating Seminary Street directly west of the ballpark, construction crews also laid the foundation for a {{convert|30000|sqft|adj=on}} underground clubhouse beneath it, and triangular lot bordered by Clark, Waveland, and the park. Construction was complete for the start of the 2016 season. At grade level above the clubhouse, the Cubs created an outdoor space that is open to anyone, with or without a ticket, with seating, grassy areas, and additional vendor kiosks. Called \"The Park at Wrigley\", this area houses an ice rink for open skating during the winter. Restoration of the groundskeeper's house (which from 1923 to 1957 was the home of the stadium groundskeeper) at the northwestern corner of the park was also completed in 2016.\n\nOther major changes, such as installing a new gate on the west side of the ballpark, relocating bullpens from along foul-lines to underneath the bleachers, and additional seating in the foul territory formerly occupied by the bullpens, were completed in time for the 2017 season. A complete renovation of the visitor's locker room is scheduled for the winter of 2018\u201319. Additional significant renovations planned include: \"bunker suites\" \u2014 suites that would have no view of the field, but would instead lead to seating areas \u2014 beneath the concourse down the third-base line; removal of old ramps to the upper deck to be replaced with stairs; new elevators to comply with [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] regulations; and additional signage on the grandstand facade, which includes a ribbon-style board.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yellon|first1=Al|title=More Wrigley Field Renovation Plans Revealed|url=http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2014/8/4/5966637/wrigley-field-renovation-plans|website=bleedcubbieblue.com|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]]|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the video screens were controversial and met with resistance by some fans who oppose putting video screens at Wrigley in deference to tradition and is strenuously opposed by the rooftop owners association, owners of 15 rooftop clubs overlooking Wrigley who have a contract with the Cubs that runs through 2023 requiring them to pay the team 17 percent of their gross annual revenue. The association said the new signs would cut down their view of the ballpark and \"would absolutely violate our 20-year contract, just as they violate the spirit of Wrigley\u2019s long-standing landmark status.\" Owners of the rooftop clubs sued the city in August 2014, seeking to block the expansion.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Slodysko, Speilman|first1=Brian, Fran|title=Rooftop club owners sue city to block Wrigley Field plan|url=http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/rooftop-club-owners-sue-city-block-wrigley-field-plan/thu-08142014-604pm|website=suntimes.com|publisher=Sun-Times Media|accessdate=October 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027090204/http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/rooftop-club-owners-sue-city-block-wrigley-field-plan/thu-08142014-604pm|archive-date=October 27, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, many of the association owners have sold their properties to the Ricketts family, paving the way for the completion of the bleacher project.\n\n[[File:Chicago Cubs Host First World Series Games in 71 years.webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=00:05|200px|News report by [[Voice of America]] about ticket prices at the [[2016 World Series]], the first world series game at [[Wrigley Field]] in 71 years.<ref>http://www.voanews.com/a/expectations-high-chicago-cubs-host-world-series-games/3571376.html</ref>]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of events at Wrigley Field]]\n*[[History of the Chicago Cubs]]\n*[[History of the Chicago Bears]]\n*[[History of the Arizona Cardinals]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Wrigley Field}}\n[[Category:History of Chicago|Wrigley Field]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball|Wrigley Field]]\n[[Category:Wrigley Company]]\n[[Category:Wrigley Field]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe '''history of [[Wrigley Field]]''', the home of the [[Chicago Cubs]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]], begins well before the Cubs played their first game in that venue.\n\n==Before the Federal League==\n[[File:Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, circa 1900.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, seen around 1900, from Sheffield Avenue.

[[William Passavant]], a prominent [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] missionary, had inherited the land decades before.  Passavant began to develop the land as early as 1868, including the construction of St. Mark's Church by 1874.  In 1891, Passavant helped establish the Chicago Lutheran Seminary on the site.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Shea | first1 = Stuart\n | title = Wrigley Field: The Long Life & Contentious Times of the Friendly Confines\n | location = Chicago and London\n | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]]\n | page = 5\n | date = 2014\n | isbn = 978-0-226-13427-7 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Hageman| first1 = William \n | title = Before there was a Wrigley, there was a seminary\n | newspaper = Chicago Tribune\n | date = March 30, 2014\n \n | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-before-wrigley-met-0330-20140330,0,1153073.story\n | accessdate = March 29, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A period postcard featuring a photo taken several years after the photo above, and from a position further north up Sheffield Avenue near its intersection with Waveland Avenue.

The following year, the president's house was constructed at the corner of Sheffield and Waveland.  In 1893, the seminary spent $25,000 to construct the four-story Eliza Hall housing the library, chapel, lecture and student rooms further to the west along Waveland.  By 1899, four homes were built for professors from the northwest corner of the block (at Waveland and Stella) stretching south along Stella.  The seminary had ambitious plans for expansion.  In 1905, it announced plans to build additional buildings on the southwest corner of the block housing dining halls, a gymnasium, and more lecture and student rooms, along with additional professors' homes on either side of Eliza Hall.  The buildings were to be arranged around a central quadrangle.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Plans for New Buildings\n | journal = The Chicago Lutheran Seminary Record\n | volume = 10\n | pages = 36\u201337\n | date = April 1905\n }}</ref>\n\nThe seminary, however, was attempting to flourish in the context of a changing community.  The extension of the [[Chicago 'L'|elevated]] system into the area in 1900 led to rapid development of the surrounding neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Addison (3600N/940W)\n | url = http://www.chicago-l.org/stations/addison-howard.html\n | accessdate = March 30, 2014}}</ref>  As the area started taking on an increasingly urban character, the seminary abandoned its plans to develop the site and instead sought to sell its land and find a quieter location.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, other developments were coming together to chart a very different future for this plot of land. As early as 1905, rumors had been swirling that minor-league [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] was seeking to locate a franchise in Chicago as part of a strategy to achieve [[Major League Baseball|major league]] status on par with the [[National League]] and the recently established [[American League]].  The [[Chicago]] market was one of the most lucrative in the country, and was already occupied by the NL's [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] and the AL's [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]]. Charles Havenor (owner of the AA [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]]), and brothers [[Joe Cantillon]] (manager of the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]]) and Mike Cantillon (owner of the AA [[Minneapolis Millers]]), saw an opportunity to make profit by snapping up choice property in the event that the AA decided to move into the Chicago market.  Since the White Sox played on the South Side at [[South Side Park]], and the Cubs were firmly ensconced on the West Side at [[West Side Park]], Havenor and the Cantillons looked to the rapidly developing North Side as the best place to situate a team. The seminary's location represented the best open land on the North Side. In 1909, the seminary, eager to move, sold the property to Havenor and the Cantillons for $175,000 and relocated to the suburb of [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], Illinois, where it remained until 1967.  Havenor and the Cantillons brought in additional investors in 1910, including E.T. Harmon and Edmund Archambault, wealthy [[Milwaukee]] businessmen.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Deveney| first1 = Sean\n | title = Before Wrigley Became Wrigley: The Inside Story of the First Years of the Cubs' Home Field\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Sports Publishing\n | pages = 9\u201312\n | date = 2014\n | isbn = 978-1-61321-648-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eliza Hall at Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|left|400px|A close-up view of Eliza Hall (\"Students Building\") and the professors residences from the same series of postcards as seen from Waveland Avenue.]]\n\nThe new owners had intended to keep the sale out of the news, but those plans were foiled when members of the seminary board complained that the seminary could have obtained $200,000 in the sale.  Havenor was forced to publicly deny any intention on invading the Chicago market.  Other AA team owners got cold feet at the prospect of a war with the major leagues, and elected a president that was unwilling to countenance such a scheme.  Over the next couple years, Havenor gradually gave up hope of developing the property, selling out his interest to the remaining investors shortly before his death in April 1912.  The former seminary site was not developed any further, and the former seminary buildings were converted into residential units.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Deveney| first1 = Sean\n | title = Before Wrigley Became Wrigley: The Inside Story of the First Years of the Cubs' Home Field\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Sports Publishing\n | pages = 12\u201317\n | date = 2014\n | isbn = 978-1-61321-648-4}}</ref>\n\n==Weeghman Park and the Federal League (1913\u20131915)==\n[[File:Weeghman Park Construction.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Construction of Weeghman Park, early April 1914.]]\nThe [[Federal League]] began its existence as a minor league in 1913, locating franchises in six cities, including Chicago. The Chicago franchise, known as the Chi-Feds, played its home games at the baseball grounds at [[DePaul University]].\n\nJohn T. Powers, founder and president of the new Federal League, had ambitions of building the new organization into a premier minor league, on par with the American Association. By the middle of the 1913 season, however, the owners had forced Powers out of his job, sensing that the Federal League had the potential to become a viable major league. Replacing him as president was James A. Gilmore, a wealthy Chicago businessman who had made his fortune in coal. Gilmore had the organizational and political skills necessary to mount a serious challenge to the established major leagues.\n\nGilmore brought on board two partners to control the key Chicago franchise. One was William Walker, a fish wholesaler. The other was the flamboyant [[Charles Weeghman|Charles A. Weeghman]], known as \"Lucky Charlie\", who had made a quick fortune in local lunch counters (a predecessor to [[fast food]]). Weeghman became the club president and the main force behind the team from that point onward, with Walker willing to remain in the background, and Gilmore tending to League issues. Weeghman made headlines by landing star shortstop [[Joe Tinker]] from the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in December 1913. The Tinker acquisition was the shot in the arm that gave the franchise the momentum to think big for the upcoming 1914 season.\n\n[[File:Weeghman Park Outfield April 1914.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A view of the Weeghman Park outfield taken in April 1914.  Note the former seminary buildings beyond the fence, the original location of the scoreboard in left field, and the \"jury box\" bleachers in right-center field.  Compare this image with the picture below taken from the same vantage point in 1915.]]\n\nWeeghman chose to relocate the franchise from DePaul to the former seminary grounds at Clark and Addison owned by Archambault and the Cantillons. Although the major leagues threw up a number of roadblocks, including an attempt to secure rights to part of the land on the block, in late December 1913 Weeghman secured a ninety-nine year lease on the property. The lease stipulated, among other things, that improvements on the property could not exceed $70,000. Within several months, however, Weeghman would spend several times that amount in erecting his new ballpark.\n\nWeeghman hired [[Zachary Taylor Davis]], architect of [[Comiskey Park]] (which became the home of the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] in June 1910), to design the new ballpark. Weeghman wanted the park to rival the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City|New York]], but in the end the single-decked grandstand as designed bore little resemblance to it.\n\n[[File:1914 Weeghman Park left field.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Weeghman Park, May 1914.  Note Eliza Hall beyond the left-field fence.  During the park's first three games in April 1914, the original fence proved too inviting to batters, leading the team to move it back during the next road trip.  Relocating the fence necessitated demolition of a porch on Eliza Hall - note the discoloration where the porch had been attached.  That building was demolished altogether shortly before the 1915 season and replaced with bleachers.]]\n\nWork on the property didn't begin until February 23, 1914, exactly two months before the Chi-Feds' scheduled home opener. After the grounds had been cleared, groundbreaking ceremonies took place on March 4. Under the guidance of the Blome-Sinek company, the lead construction contractor, the park came together over the remainder of March and the first half of April. Despite a brief strike by construction workers in early April, the new park was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.<ref>{{cite news | title=Seminary gave way to Cub faithful | work=Chicago Tribune | date=March 30, 2014 | author=Hageman, William | location=A | page=14}}</ref>\n\nThe new ballpark, known as Weeghman Park, was a modern steel and concrete baseball plant (in the industrial lexicon of the day). It featured a single-decked grandstand sweeping from right field behind home plate to near the left field corner. Perched on top of the grandstand roof behind home plate was a small area for the press.\n\nA modern-day visitor to the original Weeghman Park would have difficulty recognizing the outfield aside from the familiar buildings on the opposite side of Waveland and Sheffield Avenues (which haven't changed much at all). The dimensions of the original playing field along the foul lines were quite short. The distance from home plate to the right field brick fence along Sheffield Avenue was around 300 feet at the foul line. Left field was not much better, partly because several old seminary buildings stood between the wooden left field fence and Waveland Avenue. The left field fence also featured a large scoreboard. Like most of the parks of the day, the field was essentially angular, as it was shaped by the surrounding grid street pattern. The right and left field walls converged in a corner in deep center field, nearly 450 feet from home plate. Because of the constricted size of much of the outfield near the corners, bleachers were limited to a small jury box in right-center field. All told, Weeghman Park had a [[seating capacity]] of 14,000, but this was frequently exceeded by the many standing room only crowds of the day.\n\n[[File:Weeghman Park 1915.jpg|thumb|left|250px|New left field bleachers at Weeghman Park, 1915. Note the scoreboard has now been moved to center field.  These bleachers occupied the former site of Eliza Hall.]]\n\nAfter an unusual number of home runs were hit during the Chi-Feds' first home series against Kansas City in April, Weeghman decided the left field wall was too cozy a target, and had the entire fence moved back some 25 feet. To do this, the front porch had to be removed from the old seminary building beyond the wall.\n\nBefore the start of the 1915 season, Weeghman made additional changes to the outfield. Gone were the jury-box bleachers in right-center field. The old seminary buildings beyond left field were finally demolished in March. In their place, Weeghman had wooden bleachers erected from the left-field corner to center field, raising the park's capacity to roughly 18,000. The scoreboard was relocated to center field, where it has remained in one form or another since then (with the exception of the latter part of the 1937 season during construction of the current bleachers).\n\nOn the field, the Chi-Feds were renamed the [[Chicago Whales]] for the club's sophomore season. Weeghman Park was fast becoming the best place to watch baseball in Chicago, as the Whales fought their way to the Federal League pennant in one of the closest races in major league history. Additionally, fans enjoyed Weeghman's high standards for cleanliness and promotion. He was an early champion of Ladies' Day (every Friday) and in 1916 would become the first baseball owner to allow fans to keep foul balls. And as a successful restaurateur, his food was top-notch. Long before the Wrigley family entered the scene, the park was already famous for its hospitality.\n\nDespite the exciting pennant race and generally high quality of baseball played in the Federal League, the League was hemorrhaging money. In December 1915, the League capitulated to the other major leagues and disbanded. But all was not lost for Weeghman, however. He was allowed to purchase the Cubs franchise for $500,000, and promptly moved his new club out of the dilapidated West Side Park and into his Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. The purchase was in reality a merger between the Whales and the Cubs, as a number of former Whales stars, such as Max Flack and Claude Hendrix, found themselves playing in the same park as Cubs the following season.\n\n[[File:Weeghman Park Panorama 1915.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Weeghman Park, home of the [[Federal League]] champion [[Chicago Whales]], as seen from Sheffield Avenue, in 1915. With the park now occupying all the land right up to Waveland Avenue, its left field area is substantially larger than it was the previous year, as is apparent from the considerable distance between the end of the left-field grandstand and the left-field corner.  For comparison, see the above picture taken from the same vantage point in 1914.]]\n\n==Weeghman Park to Cubs Park to Wrigley Field (1916\u20131932)==\n[[File:Max Flack Cubs 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cubs right fielder [[Max Flack]] in front of original short right field wall, c. 1920. Note the [[Doublemint]] \"elves\" atop the scoreboard, and the [[Wilson Sporting Goods]] sign on the right field wall.]]\n\nThe Cubs played their first game at Weeghman Park on April 20, 1916, besting the [[Cincinnati Reds]] 7\u20136 in eleven innings. This proved to be the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable season. After another year in the bottom half of the standings, the Cubs won the National League pennant in 1918 under manager [[Fred Mitchell (baseball)|Fred Mitchell]]. The victory was not without a little outside help, as wartime conditions during the height of American involvement in [[World War I]] caused major league baseball to end the regular season on September 1. With the Cubs struggling for cash, Weeghman reluctantly rented the larger capacity [[Comiskey Park]] for the Cubs' home games in the [[1918 World Series|World Series]]. For the Cubs, the experience was a bust, as the club lost the series to [[Babe Ruth]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in six games to relatively anemic attendance. Such losses may have provided the final push forcing Charlie Weeghman out of management following the season.\n\nAlthough Weeghman was clearly the most dominant figure in the revamped Cubs organization in 1916, a number of investors had taken up minority shares in the club. One of the new investors was [[chewing gum]] magnate [[William Wrigley Jr.|William Wrigley]]. Over the next couple years, as Weeghman's financial fortunes off the field entered a sharp decline, Wrigley acquired an increasing number of shares in the club and took on a growing role in the team's affairs. In November 1918, Weeghman gave up his remaining interest to Wrigley, resigned as president, and left baseball for good. Wrigley would acquire complete control of the Cubs by 1921.\n\nWith Weeghman out of the picture, starting in 1919 the park was generally referred to as Cubs Park. Although the Cubs featured stars such as pitchers [[Grover Cleveland Alexander|Grover Alexander]] and [[Hippo Vaughn]], along with a young catcher named [[Gabby Hartnett]], over the next few seasons Cubs Park was the setting for largely also-ran teams.\n\nThe fans had even more to be frustrated about off the field. Rumors of thrown games plagued the Cubs during the latter part of the 1920 season gave impetus to the criminal investigations which eventually led to uncovering the infamous [[Black Sox Scandal]] across town with the White Sox. In addition, 1920 marked the beginning of prohibition, meaning fans would have to find some other way to quench their thirst during the many hot summer afternoons at Cubs Park.\n\nAlthough the Cubs teams of the early 1920s were little more than also-rans, the fans still flocked to Cubs Park. In 1922, 542,283 fans went through the turnstiles\u2014the second-highest attendance in the National League\u2014to watch a fourth-place club.\n\n===Major renovations (1922\u201323)===\n\n[[File:Cubs Park Rendering 1922.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Aerial rendering of the proposed expansion of Cubs Park, circa 1922.]]\n\nBy 1922, William Wrigley had decided that after nine seasons, both the seating and the playing field of cozy Cubs Park were ready for a major expansion. Rather than rebuilding the grandstand from scratch, Wrigley hired original architect Zachary Taylor Davis to make the expansion around the existing structure. The grandstand would be sliced into three pieces, with the home plate section placed on rollers and moved roughly 60 feet west (away from right field), and the left field section about 100 feet northwest. Both gaps were to be filled in with more seating, resulting in a significantly longer grandstand and the noticeable \"dog leg\" shape of the stands on the first base side visible to this day. Additionally, the foul ground and the height of the fence in front of it would be reduced by additional rows of box seats added in front of the existing grandstand. The diamond and the foul lines would be rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise from their earlier orientation, allowing for those extra box seats. Home plate was moved with the center section of the original grandstand; in the current configuration, the original location is in the vicinity of the first base coaches box.\n\nThe relocation of the grandstand would make right field far more spacious than before, even with the addition of new bleachers in right field from the corner to the center field scoreboard. The old wooden bleachers in left field were to be dismantled and replaced with newer steel-framed wooden seats like those being installed in right field. The renovations would boost the park's capacity from roughly 18,000 to 31,000. Its dimensions would be roughly 320 feet in left field, 318 in right, and 446 feet to straightaway center.\n\n[[File:Relocation of Cubs Park grandstand 1922-23.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Cubs Park grandstand, seen from the corner of Clark and Addision, divided into three segments during the 1922-23 expansion, prior to the construction of additional sections between the relocated segments.  Note that, in the days before the famous marquee was installed, the ballpark was identified by a sign along the top of the grandstand reading \"Chicago National League Baseball Club.\"]]\n\nWork on the renovations began in December 1922 and were completed in time for the 1923 season opener. The changes were of such magnitude that many publications of the time referred to the \"new\" Cubs Park. Fans flocked to the park, and attendance shot up to 703,705 for the 1923 season, although this was once again only good for second-best in the National League. On the field, however, the Cubs remained also-rans. The team drifted aimlessly through the middle of the standings in 1923 and '24. By 1925, the Cubs found themselves commemorating their fiftieth season in the National League by finishing last for the first time (which in 1925 meant eighth place).\n\nThe recently renovated Cubs Park, while a hit with the fans, was not without its critics. Their main objection was that the new left field bleachers were simply too easy a target for right-handed hitters. By late July and early August 1925, reporters were frequently griping about games lost to fly balls which would have been easy outs without the left field bleachers. During the Cubs' first road trip that month, the half of the left field bleachers closest to the foul line was dismantled, leaving a \"jury box\" of seats running from deep left-center to the center field scoreboard. The change cost the Cubs over a thousand seats, although that left-field area was sometimes filled with standing-room-only spectators behind ropes, as was the custom of the day. With the left field line now at a substantial 364 feet from home plate, home run production dropped.\n\n===Double decking the grandstand (1927\u201328)===\n[[File:Wrigley Field split upper deck 1927.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The upper deck of the newly rechristened Wrigley Field remained unfinished throughout the 1927 season, extending only along the third base line.]]\nBy 1926, the Cubs were benefiting handily from the peak of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Nearly 900,000 fans went through the turnstiles at a park with a capacity of just over 30,000. After the close of the season, work began on adding a second deck to the grandstand. The original idea was to have the job completed by the opening of the 1927 season, but by April, only the third-base side of the upper deck had been completed, temporarily giving the park a startlingly asymmetrical appearance.\n\nCubs Park was formally renamed Wrigley Field prior to the start of the 1927 season.\n\nDespite the half-finished state of the upper deck expansion, the 1927 Cubs drew over 1.1 million fans, becoming the first National League team ever to do so. In addition to the increased capacity of the park, the Cubs helped their own cause by becoming an increasingly competitive team under manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]].\n\nThe upper deck was finally completed in time for the 1928 season, which saw the Cubs break the million mark in attendance yet again. The timing couldn't have been more fortuitous. In 1929, the Cubs put together one of the most potent lineups in major league history, and easily walked to the National League pennant with stars like [[Hack Wilson]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[Kiki Cuyler]], [[Charlie Root]] and [[Pat Malone]]. Season attendance soared to nearly 1.5 million fans. This would remain the major league record for seventeen years, a record aided in large part by declining major league attendance during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. The Cubs themselves would not top this mark for another forty years.\n\nAs the World Series approached, Wrigley sought to provide even more seating at the park. He contracted to have temporary wooden bleachers erected on both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, raising the park's capacity to roughly 50,000. Both streets were closed to traffic. In the end, the bleachers were only needed for games one and two of the [[1929 World Series]], both of which the Cubs lost on their way to a five-game defeat at the hands of the underdog [[Philadelphia Athletics]].\n\nBy the early 1930s, distance markers were posted: left field line, 364 feet; left-center against the outer wall, 372; left center, corner of bleachers, 364; deep center field corner, 440; right center, 354; right field line, 321.\n\nDuring the 1968\u20131970 off-seasons, the concrete in the upper deck was stripped and replaced. After 40 years of harsh Chicago winters, the original concrete was showing signs of wear and tear; it was replaced with precast concrete installed over the 1927 steel framework.<ref>Chicago Tribune, January 31, 1969 pC1</ref> In 2004, nearly 40 years later, this precast concrete itself began to show deterioration as several chunks of the precast concrete fell, leading to increased safety inspections and the installation of protective netting.<ref>Chicago Tribune, December 22, 2004</ref>\n\n==\"Beautiful Wrigley Field\" (1932\u20131981)==\n\n===Construction of the bleachers (1937)===\nWrigley Field is known for the [[Parthenocissus tricuspidata|Boston ivy]] (''Parthenocissus tricuspidata'') planted against the outfield wall in 1937 by [[Bill Veeck]], whose father had been team president until his 1933 death. If the ball is hit into and lost in the ivy, then it is ruled a [[ground rule double|ground-rule double]], provided that the defensive outfielder raises his hands to signify that the ball has been lost in the ivy; if the player attempts to search for the ball, the play is considered live, and no ground-rule double is ruled. Wrigley is also known for the manual scoreboard Veeck also erected. No batted ball has ever hit the scoreboard; indeed, very few home runs have even landed in the \"upper deck\" of the center field bleachers. However, [[Sam Snead]] did manage to hit the big board with a golf ball teed off from home plate, on April 17, 1951, just prior to the Cubs home opener.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/chc/history/timeline07.jsp |title=Cubs Timeline &#124; cubs.com: History |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, the Cubs announced plans to rebuild the bleachers in concrete instead of wood, to be fronted by brick that would soon be covered in ivy, and to build a new scoreboard. To make the outfield look more symmetrical and graceful, the plans called for extending the left field bleachers to a point closer to the corner. The gentle curves between the ends of the left and right field bleachers would become popularly known as the \"wells\". That summer, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' ran a series of articles about major league ballparks, and the writer sharply criticized the Cubs for a remodeling that he suspected would result in too many \"cheap\" home runs. The writer later retracted when he saw that the final plan was ''somewhat'' more spacious than originally announced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nBe that as it may, construction went on behind a temporary fence during the summer, and the finished product was unveiled on September 4, in time for the last month of the season. Bill Veeck's famous ivy was planted not long after, but it would be another year before it fully took hold. According to his own autobiography, ''Veeck as in Wreck'', he planted [[Celastrus|Bittersweet]], which would grow quickly, and also the more famous Boston ivy, which would eventually take over. Another part of the arboretum was to be a series of Chinese elms on the large \"stairsteps\" up to the scoreboard, as well as one apiece in the little triangle at the top of each \"well\". According to Veeck's biography, that plan did not fare so well as the winds kept blowing the leaves off. Management finally gave up \"after about twenty tries\", so the trees are long gone, leaving just the large bare steps and (until 2006) the little flat triangular supports at the tops of the \"wells\". According to Veeck, the trees themselves were inexpensive, but the special construction for them in the bleachers cost about $200,000.\n\n[[File:Wrigley Field 1935.JPG|thumb|right|190px|Wrigley Field seen from above during the [[1935 World Series]].  This was one of three times prior to 2005 that the Cubs erected temporary bleachers over the Waveland and Sheffield sidewalks.  The other occasions were the [[1929 World Series|1929]] and [[1932 World Series]].]]\n\nAnother mistake was constructing bleachers in straightaway center field: The batters could easily lose sight of the ball in the white shirts worn by spectators on sunny days, because the wall was not high enough to provide a full [[Batter's eye|batter's background]] by itself. Various methods were tried to get around this. At one time a flat canopy was extended over the area, to try to put the spectators in shadow, but that was ineffective (the 2005\u20132006 reconstruction would to some extent revisit that concept). For a while in the mid-1960s, a screen was attached to the top of the wall and the ivy twined its way up. Batters and bleacher fans disliked it, and it was removed after a couple of seasons. Later, for a number of years, a green tarp covered those seats.\n\nAfter generally being closed to spectators sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the last time those three problem sections were used for baseball was during the 1962 All-Star game. The seats continued to be used for other events such as football and soccer, during the years when the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[Chicago Sting]] played their games here.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wrigley Field Sign.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Wrigley Field sign on W. Addison St., Chicago]] -->\nBy the 1990s, the area was occupied by juniper plants, which nicely complemented the ivy. Also, the layout was tweaked a bit, to open up a few seats on either side of the straight center field area while still providing a rectangular background from the perspective of the batter.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, the plants were temporarily removed during reconstruction (see below). Over the following winter, a lounge was constructed in the upper part of this area and new rows of juniper bushes were placed in the lower part.\n\nBy the end of 1937, the dimensions were set: 355&nbsp;feet to the left field corner, a few feet ''behind'' where the corner wall tangents the foul pole; 368 to fairly deep left-center; 400 to the deepest part of center (at the right edge of the batters background area); 368 to right center; and 353 to the right field foul pole. There are other intriguing distances that have never been posted. In the original ''Encyclopedia of Baseball'', by Hy Turkin and S.C. Thompson, 1951, measurements of 357 feet to the left field \"well\" and 363 to the right field \"well\" were revealed. That would put the closest point of the left end of the bleachers no more than about 350 feet from home plate, a fact many pitchers have cursed over the years. Left-center in general is shallow. Straightaway center is probably about 390. Deep center and the right field area in general are better balanced. But the shallowness of the left-center power alley, really too cozy for major league standards, and the resultant increase in home runs in the decades since 1937, suggest that the ''Chicago Tribune's'' original skeptical assessment was correct.\n\nThe \"basket\", an angling chain-link fence that runs along the top of the outfield wall, was installed at the start of the 1970 season. During the 1969 pennant race, there were several incidents of fans interfering with fly balls and even falling onto the field. There was also the first and only incident of a fan running the field and escaping without prosecution.  A famous photograph was taken of the incident and published in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imgur.com/Wa79lR8 |title=the simple image sharer |publisher=imgur |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>  The basket was intended to deter or prevent that kind of problem. Security cameras were also installed at that time. The \"basket\" angles away from the wall, and is also higher than the wall in order to provide some balance for the pitchers. However, over the years a number of baseballs have been hit \"into the basket\" for home runs that previously would have been outs, or off the wall, or possibly interfered with by fans. The basket only exists where there is seating. During the 1980s, when the bleacher seating was extended over the \"catwalks\", i.e. the bleacher ramps in extreme left and right fields, the basket was likewise extended.\n\n===First attempt at lights (1941)===\nLights were scheduled to be added to Wrigley Field in 1942, but after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], then-owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] (son of the late William) donated the necessary materials to the war effort. Founded by P.K. Wrigley, the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] (known for the first half of the 1943 season as the All-American Girls Softball League) began their inaugural season of play in the spring of 1943. On the evening of July 1, 1943, teams from the All-American League played an exhibition game at Wrigley Field as part of a Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC) recruiting rally, attracting approximately 7,000 fans. With temporary lighting set up behind home plate along the first and third base lines, this would be the first night game to be played at Wrigley Field. The All-American Girls Baseball League would play the second ever night game at Wrigley the following year in another war drive exhibition.\n\nBaseball boomed after the war, allowing P. K. Wrigley to procrastinate on the issue of permanent lighting. He eventually decided ''never'' to install lights for a variety of publicly stated reasons, so Wrigley Field remained a bastion of day baseball until the [[Tribune Company|Chicago Tribune Company]] era, which began in 1981; the first night game with permanent lighting was not until 1988. \n[[File:Bob-horsch-wrigley-field-panoramic.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Chicago Cubs vs Boston Red Sox - Interleague play in June 2005]]\n[[File:Wrigley-Panorama.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Panoramic view of Wrigley Field]]\n[[File:Wrigley-para3.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Panoramic view of Wrigley field in 2008]]\n\n==\"Building a New Tradition in the Friendly Confines\" (1981\u2013present)==\n\n===Night baseball (1988)===\n[[File:WrigleyBartmanNight.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Wrigleyville under the lights during game 6 of the [[2003 National League Championship Series|2003 NLCS]]]]\nThe Cubs had been run almost like a hobby by the Wrigleys, but the Tribune Company was interested in the Cubs strictly as a business. The new owners started talking  lights and began stirring debate on the matter. One of P. K. Wrigley's stated reasons for not installing lights was that it would upset the neighborhood, and the initial negative reaction to the Tribune Company's intentions validated P. K.'s prediction.\n\nResistance to the installation of lights was not limited to those who lived nearby and opposed the lights on the practical grounds of bothersome brightness or the noise and crowds from night games. Many Cubs fans who lived outside Wrigleyville opposed the idea simply due to the fact that the Cubs' stance as the last team to resist night baseball was a point of pride, as it was seen as a vestige of baseball's heritage as a pastoral game, played in natural sunlight. Some Cubs fans also had fond associations with [[Gabby Hartnett|Gabby Hartnett's]] famous \"Homer in the Gloaming,\" in which Hartnett hit a crucial home run in the bottom of the ninth of a game on the verge of being called for darkness, helping the Cubs to win the 1938 pennant.\n\nThe City of Chicago had passed an ordinance banning night events at Wrigley Field, due to its presence in the residential [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] neighborhood, so Tribune was unable to install lights unless the ordinance was repealed. They compromised by scheduling a significant number of 3:00 starts, which typically carried games into the evening but did not require lights for games that completed within three hours or so.\n\nThis debate continued for several years, and became more intense as the Cubs returned to competitiveness during the early 1980s. When the Cubs won the [[National League Eastern Division]] title in 1984, then-commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] announced that the Cubs would lose [[home field advantage]] should they advance to the [[1984 World Series|World Series]] (home field advantage alternated between the champions of the [[National League]] and [[American League]] until 2003), since by this time nearly all World Series games were played at night in the Eastern and Central time zones. After winning their two scheduled home (day) games in the [[1984 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], the Cubs lost all three games in San Diego, so Kuhn's threat became moot. But the following year, new commissioner [[Peter Ueberroth]] announced that because Wrigley Field had no lights, the Cubs would have to play ''all'' future postseason games at another ballpark, likely [[Comiskey Park]], [[Soldier Field]], or possibly even St. Louis' [[Busch Stadium II|Busch Stadium]], or [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The Cubs fell out of contention for the next several years, however, and the possibility of playing post-season \"home\" games in other cities did not arise.\n\nThe Cubs, under team president [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]], quickly changed the issue from lights or no lights to Wrigley Field or move out of town. With typical bluntness, Green said, \"if there are no lights in Wrigley Field, ''there will be no Wrigley Field.''\" Green seriously considered shuttering Wrigley and playing at Comiskey Park as tenants of the White Sox for a year, in hopes that the neighborhood would feel the loss of revenue and back down. The Cubs also explored moving to several suburban locations, including a site adjacent to [[Arlington Park]] in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]] and another in [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]]. There was even talk of a drastic move which involved selling the stadium to local college [[DePaul University]], who would likely tear down Wrigley Field to host its indoor sports or convert it to a full-time football stadium in hopes of returning football to the campus. The Cubs would then likely build a new ballpark near the Rosemont Horizon (now the [[Allstate Arena]], where DePaul plays its home games currently) in suburban [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]].\n\nThe Cubs' new stance quickly changed the context of the debate, as even the most adamant opponents of adding lights didn't want to see the Cubs leave for the suburbs. Schaumburg officials were so convinced that the Cubs were actually coming that land was purchased by investors hoping to build a new ballpark off the [[Elgin-O'Hare Expressway]] west of [[Interstate 355|I-355]]. When the Cubs and the city of Chicago came to an agreement to keep the team on the North Side, the site spawned a ballpark anyway, with field dimensions and shape identical to Wrigley Field, even mimicking the \"wells\" along the outfield wall, and the 'dogleg' in the visitor's dugout along the first base line. That stadium, [[Boomers Stadium]] (formerly known as Alexian Field), is now home to the (non-affiliated) minor league [[Schaumburg Boomers]].\n\nIn the fall of 1987, Chicago mayor [[Harold Washington]] proposed a compromise ordinance to the Chicago City Council which allowed the Cubs to install lights, but limited the number of night games. Washington died a week after the compromise was proposed, but the city eventually approved a compromise in February 1988 under interim mayor [[Eugene Sawyer]]. [[Major League Baseball]] responded by awarding the Cubs the [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1990 All-Star Game]].\n\n[[File:Wrigley Sheffield bleachers 070602.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Lights, bleacher expansion, and exterior ivy]]\nThe first major league night game at Wrigley was attempted on August 8 against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], but was rained out after 3\u00bd innings. During the rain delay, several Cubs players, imitating a scene in the recent film hit, ''[[Bull Durham]]'', played \"slip-and-slide\" on the tarp. One source says the group included [[Greg Maddux]], [[Al Nipper]], [[Les Lancaster]] and [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]]. Manager [[Don Zimmer]] was not amused, and they were fined $500 apiece.\n\nThe first official night game was played the following night, August 9 against the [[New York Mets]] (in front of a nationally televised audience watching [[Vin Scully]] and [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] call the game on [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]), ending a streak of 5,687 consecutive home day games. However, this was not the first night game of ''any'' kind at Wrigley, as in the 1940s, some [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League|AAGPBL]] night games were played in Wrigley Field using temporary lighting structures; specifically, the All-Star Game held in July 1943, was the first night baseball game there, according to the Lowry book and the movie ''[[A League of Their Own]]''.\n\nStarting with their first full season with lights, in 1989, as part of the compromise with the city, the Cubs were limited to 18 night games within their 81-game regular season schedule, plus any post-season games that might have to be played at night for TV scheduling reasons. The timing of the lights' installation proved fortuitous, as the Cubs reached the post-season in 1989. Their first two post-season night games were the first two games of the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], on October 4 and 5. They lost the first game against the [[San Francisco Giants]] 11-3, and won the second game 9-5.\n\nThe Cubs' post-season appearances since 1988 (as well as their one-game regular-season playoff with San Francisco in 1998) have featured mostly night games, the exceptions (as of 2007) being the fourth game of their [[2003 National League Division Series|2003 NLDS]] matchup with the Atlanta Braves and third game of the [[2007 National League Division Series|2007 NLDS]] against the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of which were Saturday afternoon contests.\n\nIn recent years, the Cubs have successfully lobbied for additional regular-season night games (up to a potential 30 per year, as of 2007). However, per their agreement with the city, they still play most of their games during the day. Due to the limited night schedule, night games at Wrigley Field are considered an \"event\" and are almost always sold out well in advance. Some observers compare the atmosphere of a Wrigley Field night game to that of [[Rush Street (Chicago)|Rush]] and [[Division Street|Division]] streets, the longtime epicenter of Chicago's nightclub scene.\n\nWrigley Field has continuously evolved over its 90-plus seasons. There is relatively little left of the original that is visible to the casual viewer. One of the more obvious originals were the brick portions of the outer bleacher wall, visible in the \"back of Wrigley Field\" photo. The Cubs' bleacher expansion resulted in removal of those bricks, which were later sold to the public individually at a \"garage sale\" at the start of the 2006 season.\n\n===Bleacher expansion and renovation (2005\u20132006)===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Wrigley Waveland bleachers 070602.JPG\n| width1 = 156\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = 2005\u20132006 bleacher expansion<br>extending over sidewalk.\n| image2 = BLBleachers.jpg\n| width2 = 125\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Remodeled bleacher<br>entrance\n| footer = \n}}\n[[File:20070616 Chris Young visits Wrigley (4)-edit3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Chris Young (baseball pitcher)|Chris Young]] in the [[bullpen]] located in playable foul territory, with remodeled center field area in background.]]\nAfter lengthy debate, the reconstruction and expansion of the bleachers (by some 1,900 seats) finally began after the close of the 2005 season, although it was strongly opposed by Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley|Richard Daley]]. The first part of the process was to remove the outer brick wall, one of the last vestiges of the 1914 structure. Additionally, much of the 1937 construction behind the inner ivy-covered wall was removed (except for the steel supports and the center field upper tier) and the former sidewalk was excavated. The work progressed quickly throughout the winter, aided by the relatively mild Midwestern January.\n\nThe original concept called for the bleachers to simply extend out over the sidewalks, supported by open steel columns in cantilevered design, connecting new steel to the existing steel that supported the old bleachers. That plan was altered somewhat when it was feared the area would become an impromptu homeless shelter. Thus the vertical part of the supporting structure for the new bleachers was encased in a wall constructed of new bricks, in a style reminiscent of the original wall, and the sidewalk (repaved in brick) became a few feet narrower. The only part hanging over the sidewalk is the flat walkway behind the bleachers. The upper part of the formerly vacant center field area is occupied by a large luxury suite, fronted by darkened, slanted windows so as not to interfere with the batters' sight lines, and the lower part by juniper plants that had been temporarily removed. Another notable change to the configuration was to replace the solid door in the right field corner with a chain-link fence gate, so passers-by can see part of the ballfield (an idea borrowed from [[Oracle Park]]).\n\nVarious Internet sites displayed photos tracking the progress of construction. The results support what management had stated, that the changes would not depart radically from the previous structure.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ed |first=Easy |url=http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/section/Bleacher-Photos |title=2005-06 Bleacher Reconstruction Project - Bleed Cubbie Blue - For Chicago Cubs Fans |publisher=Bleed Cubbie Blue |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=CubsNet.com |url=http://www.cubsnet.com/node/731 |title=Wrigley Field bleachers renovation work photos |publisher=CubsNet.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wgntv.trb.com/sports/baseball/cubs/wgntv-sports-040606-cubsgallery,0,7294415.photogallery?index=1 |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622163606/http://wgntv.trb.com/sports/baseball/cubs/wgntv-sports-040606-cubsgallery%2C0%2C7294415.photogallery?index=1 |archivedate=June 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 2006, the Cubs announced the bleachers would be renamed the [[Bud Light]] bleachers.

Conventional Boston ivy was planted on the east-facing Sheffield wall, which gets a fair amount of sunlight during morning hours. The north-facing wall along Waveland, which receives little direct sunlight in the summer and none in the winter, was to have an \"evergreen\" variety, English ivy, which thrives in shade.\n\nThe bleacher expansion project was designed by HOK Architecture, of Kansas City Missouri with Osborn Engineering of Cleveland, Ohio serving as the engineer.\n\nOn January 4, 2008 the Cubs got permission to add 80 new seats to the ballpark. The Cubs also got permission to add new signs. Wrigley Field will now hold up to 41,198 people after adding the seats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Giving Wrigley a new Field (2007\u20132008)===\n[[File:Wrigley Turf Replacement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The turf replacement in progress through Wrigley's right field fan window.]]\n[[File:Wrigley Turf Replacement After.jpg|thumb|right|200px|After view of the turf replacement.]]\nAt the end of the Cubs' 2007 season, two different efforts were undertaken to upgrade the playing field at the old ballpark. A few years earlier, a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll found that the players considered Wrigley's playing field to be one of the poorest in the Major Leagues. The renovations should go a long way toward fixing that situation.\n\nFirst, as reported on the Cubs official website<ref>{{cite web|author=Carrie Muskat |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071006&content_id=2253722&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |title=Notes: Field tested, and approved &#124; cubs.com: News |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> and also reported and pictured in the November issue of ''Chicago Cubs Vine Line'', the Cubs official fan magazine (p.&nbsp;4), the outfield and portions of the infield were replaced by turf purchased from an Oswego, Illinois, firm. This was accomplished in the 13 days between the last home regular season game and the first (and last, as it turned out) post-season game for the year. The project was supervised by Roger Bossard, who is the head groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThen, following the post-season, as reported on the Cubs website<ref>{{cite web|author=Carrie Muskat |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071116&content_id=2301854&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |title=Wrigley renovations near completion &#124; cubs.com: News |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> and also reported and pictured in the December issue of ''Vine Line'' <!--(p.5)-->, a more ambitious project began, to install a state-of-the-art drainage system. The entire playing surface at Wrigley was removed, which required digging down {{convert|14 to 28|in|cm}}. The underlying base material was replaced by a system of {{convert|6000|ft}} of piping buried in a special clay. The drainage system capable of holding 60,000 gallons of water was installed, on top of which a new playing surface of Colorado-grown sod was unrolled. This renovation, replacing a system installed in 1935, makes Wrigley the last Major League field to move away from a crown-based water management system. The infield had been at a somewhat raised elevation relative to the shallow part of the outfield and the far edge of the foul ground around the infield, hence the gutters in front of the box seat railings.\n\nAs of 2008, the infield now sits lower than it did, by {{convert|14|in|cm}}, eliminating the slight downhill slope that runners had to contend with upon rounding third base, and also allowing the managers in the dugouts to see the opposite-field outfielder in full, not just his \"top half\". The system allows for much shorter rain delays, while also controlling the flow of water toward the storm sewers. The ballpark sits on a block that has a noticeable downhill slope from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. The left field (northwest) corner of the playing field is several feet below street level. The natural drainage direction is toward the right field (southeast) corner, and the new system directs all the water through an outlet under the right field corner.\n\nAs part of the excavation, the crew found and removed the foundations of the goal posts from the Bears' playing days. The crew also reported that they left a \"time capsule\" buried somewhere under the new turf. Lowering the infield by {{convert|14|in|cm}} also effectively raises the outfield barrier by {{convert|14|in|cm}}, from the standpoint of the batter. It remains to be seen whether that factor will have any effect on home run production.\n\n===Will it remain Wrigley Field? (2007\u20132008)===\nTribune owner [[Sam Zell]] announced that he would consider selling the naming rights for Wrigley Field<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-fri_wrigley_1221dec21,1,5493626.story?ctrack=1&cset=true |title=Potential Wrigley purchase by state holds up Cubs sale |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2012 }} {{Dead link|date=August 2015|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> in order to help reduce the [[Tribune Company]]'s $13 billion debt.

Ricketts]] in 2009, further improvements to the park were developed, including construction of the long-discussed \"triangle building\" immediately to the west of the park at the intersection of Clark Street and Waveland Avenue, which would house some of the team's offices as well as a retail concourse and weight room for the players. Ricketts has also stated, \"We don't have any naming-rights discussions going on at all. I think Wrigley is the name we are going to go with.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Upgrades in the plan for Wrigley Field|date=October 30, 2009|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=DeLuca, Chris}}</ref>\n\n===Daktronics video screens and bleacher reconstruction (2014\u20132017)===\nIn October 2014 demolition began on a 3-year renovation project under the ownership of Ricketts. Bleacher expansion, a pair of Daktronics video boards in left and right field, and five outfield signs were slated to debut by Opening Day 2015, but were hampered by winter weather, and construction extended well into the 2015 season. With the city of Chicago vacating Seminary Street directly west of the ballpark, construction crews also laid the foundation for a {{convert|30000|sqft|adj=on}} underground clubhouse beneath it, and triangular lot bordered by Clark, Waveland, and the park. Construction was complete for the start of the 2016 season. At grade level above the clubhouse, the Cubs created an outdoor space that is open to anyone, with or without a ticket, with seating, grassy areas, and additional vendor kiosks. Called \"The Park at Wrigley\", this area houses an ice rink for open skating during the winter. Restoration of the groundskeeper's house (which from 1923 to 1957 was the home of the stadium groundskeeper) at the northwestern corner of the park was also completed in 2016.\n\nOther major changes, such as installing a new gate on the west side of the ballpark, relocating bullpens from along foul-lines to underneath the bleachers, and additional seating in the foul territory formerly occupied by the bullpens, were completed in time for the 2017 season. A complete renovation of the visitor's locker room is scheduled for the winter of 2018-19.

Each winding has a [[capacitance]] across it and functions as an [[LC circuit]] (resonant circuit, [[tuned circuit]]), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to the way a [[tuning fork]] stores vibrational mechanical energy. The [[primary winding|primary coil]] ''(L1)'' consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a [[capacitor]] ''(C1)'' through the [[spark gap]] ''(SG)''.<ref name=\"Haddad\" /><ref name=\"Naidu\" /> The [[secondary winding|secondary coil]] ''(L2)'' consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of ''(L2)'' resonates with stray capacitance ''(C2)'', the sum of the stray [[parasitic capacitance]] between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the [[toroid]]al metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal.  The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same [[resonant frequency]]. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates back and forth between the primary and secondary coils.\n\nThe peculiar design of the coil is dictated by the need to achieve low resistive energy losses ([[Q factor|high Q factor]]) at high frequencies,<ref name=\"Sprott\" /> which results in the largest secondary voltages:\n*Ordinary power transformers have an [[magnetic core|iron core]] to increase the magnetic coupling between the coils. However at high frequencies an iron core causes energy losses due to [[eddy current]]s and [[hysteresis]], so it is not used in the Tesla coil.<ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" />\n*Ordinary transformers are designed to be \"tightly coupled\". Due to the iron core and close proximity of the windings, they have a high [[mutual inductance]] ''(M)'', the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] is close to unity 0.95 \u2013 1.0, which means almost all the magnetic field of the primary winding passes through the secondary.<ref name=\"Gerekos\" /><ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" /> The Tesla transformer in contrast is \"loosely coupled\",<ref name=\"Haddad\" /><ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" /> the primary winding is larger in diameter and spaced apart from the secondary,<ref name=\"Naidu\" /> so the mutual inductance is lower and the coupling coefficient is only 0.05 to 0.2.<ref name=\"BurnettCouplingCoefficient\">{{cite web\n | last = Burnett\n | first = Richie\n | title = Coupling Coefficient\n | work = Richie's Tesla Coil Web Page\n | publisher = Richard Burnett private website\n | date = 2008\n | url = http://www.richieburnett.co.uk/operatn2.html#quenching\n | doi = \n | accessdate = April 4, 2017}}</ref> This means that only 5% to 20% of the magnetic field of the primary coil passes through the secondary when it is open circuited.<ref name=\"Haddad\" /><ref name=\"Denicolai2\" /> The loose coupling slows the exchange of energy between the primary and secondary coils, which allows the oscillating energy to stay in the secondary circuit longer before it returns to the primary and begins dissipating in the spark.\n*Each winding is also limited to a single layer of wire, which reduces [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] losses. The primary carries very high currents.

This completes the primary circuit and current from the capacitor flows through the primary coil ''(L1)''. The current flows rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil, generating radio frequency oscillating current in the primary circuit at the circuit's [[resonant frequency]].\n#The oscillating [[magnetic field]] of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding ''(L2)'', by [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits is limited to the energy originally stored in the capacitor ''C1'', so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude (\"ring up\") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero (\"ring down\"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance ''(C2)'', the sum of the [[parasitic capacitance]] between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode ''E''. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the primary voltage. \n#The secondary current creates a magnetic field that induces voltage back in the primary coil, and over a number of additional cycles the energy is transferred back to the primary. This process repeats, the energy shifting rapidly back and forth between the primary and secondary tuned circuits. The oscillating currents in the primary and secondary gradually die out (\"ring down\") due to energy dissipated as heat in the spark gap and resistance of the coil.\n#When the current through the spark gap is no longer sufficient to keep the air in the gap ionized, the spark stops (\"quenches\"), terminating the current in the primary circuit. The oscillating current in the secondary may continue for some time. \n#The current from the supply transformer begins charging the capacitor ''C1'' again and the cycle repeats.\n\nThis entire cycle takes place very rapidly, the oscillations dying out in a time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of [[damped wave]]s, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so there are more than a hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers from the top of the coil.\n\nThe supply transformer ''(T)'' secondary winding is connected across the primary tuned circuit. It might seem that the transformer would be a leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large [[inductance]] gives it a very high [[electrical impedance|impedance]] at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate [[leakage inductance]], radio frequency [[choke (electronics)|choke]]s are placed in its secondary leads to block the RF current.\n\n===Oscillation frequency===\nTo produce the largest output voltage, the primary and secondary tuned circuits are adjusted to [[resonance]] with each other.<ref name=\"Sprott\" /><ref name=\"Anderson\" /><ref name=\"Gerekos\" />  The [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of the primary and secondary circuits, <math>\\scriptstyle f_1</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle f_2</math>, are determined by the [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] in each circuit<ref name=\"Sprott\" /><ref name=\"Anderson\" /><ref name=\"Gerekos\" /> \n:<math>f_1 = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_1 C_1 }}} \\qquad \\qquad f_2 = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_2 C_2}}}\\,</math>\nGenerally the secondary is not adjustable, so the primary circuit is tuned, usually by a moveable tap on the primary coil L<sub>1</sub>, until it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary\n:<math>f = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_1 C_1}}} = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_2 C_2}}}\\,</math>\nThus the condition for resonance between primary and secondary is\n:<math>L_1 C_1 = L_2 C_2\\,</math>\n\nThe resonant frequency of Tesla coils is in the low [[radio frequency]] (RF) range, usually between 50&nbsp;kHz and 1&nbsp;MHz.

Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, air discharges start at these points on the high voltage terminal.  The voltage on the high voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air.  The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to less than one million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of [[Transformer oil|insulating oil]].\n\n===The top load or \"toroid\" electrode===\n[[File:OneTeslaTS DRSSTC Tesla Coil closeup.jpg|thumb|Solid state DRSSTC Tesla coil with pointed wire attached to toroid to produce [[brush discharge]] ]]\n\nMost Tesla coil designs have a smooth spherical or [[toroid]]al shaped metal electrode on the high voltage terminal.  The electrode serves as one plate of a [[capacitor]], with the Earth as the other plate, forming the [[tuned circuit]] with the secondary winding.  Although the \"toroid\" increases the secondary capacitance, which tends to reduce the peak voltage, its main effect is that its large diameter curved surface reduces the [[potential gradient]] ([[electric field]]) at the high voltage terminal; it functions similarly to a [[corona ring]], increasing the voltage threshold at which air discharges such as corona and brush discharges occur.<ref name=\"Denicolai5\">[http://www.saunalahti.fi/dncmrc1/lthesis.pdf Denicolai, 2001, ''Tesla Transformer for Experimentation and Research'', Ch.3, Sec. 3\u20135, p. 22]</ref> Suppressing premature air breakdown and energy loss allows the voltage to build to higher values on the peaks of the waveform, creating longer, more spectacular streamers when air discharges finally occur.<ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" />\n\nIf the top electrode is large and smooth enough, the electric field at its surface may never get high enough even at the peak voltage to cause air breakdown, and air discharges will not occur.

Spark gaps have disadvantages due to the high primary currents they must handle. They produce a very loud noise while operating, noxious [[ozone]] gas, and high temperatures which often require a cooling system. The energy dissipated in the spark also reduces the [[Q factor]] and the output voltage.  Tesla's coils were all spark-excited. \n**'''Static spark gap''' \u2013 This is the most common type, which was described in detail in the previous section. It is used in most entertainment coils. An AC voltage from a high voltage supply transformer charges a capacitor, which discharges through the spark gap. The spark rate is not adjustable but is determined by the line frequency and the gap breakdown voltage. Multiple sparks may occur on each half-cycle, so the pulses of output voltage may not be equally-spaced.\n**'''Static triggered spark gap''' \u2013 Commercial and industrial circuits often apply a DC voltage from a power supply to charge the capacitor, and use high voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering electrode to trigger the spark.<ref name=\"Haddad\" /> This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial spark gaps are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]], reducing the length and thus the energy loss in the spark.\n**'''Rotary spark gap''' \u2013 These use a spark gap consisting of electrodes around the periphery of a wheel rotated at high speed by a motor, which create sparks when they pass by a stationary electrode. Tesla used this type on his big coils, and they are used today on large entertainment coils. The rapid separation speed of the electrodes quenches the spark quickly, allowing \"first notch\" quenching, making possible higher voltages. The wheel is usually driven by a [[synchronous motor]], so the sparks are synchronized with the AC line frequency, the spark occurring at the same point on the AC waveform on each cycle, so the primary pulses are repeatable. \n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| header = \n| image1 = Simple SSTC.gif\n| caption1 = A simple single resonant solid state Tesla coil circuit in which the ground end of the secondary supplies the feedback current phase to the transistor oscillator.\n| width1 = 200\n| image2 = Current resonance drive tesla coil.gif\n| caption2 = This block diagram explains the principle of Tesla coil current resonance type driving circuit.\n| width2 = 224\n}}\n*'''Switched''' or '''Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC)''' \u2013 These use [[power semiconductor device]]s, usually [[thyristor]]s or [[transistor]]s such as [[MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s,<ref name=\"Haddad\" /> to switch pulses of voltage from a DC power supply through the primary winding. They provide pulsed  excitation without the disadvantages of a spark gap: the loud noise, high temperatures, and poor efficiency.  The voltage, frequency, and excitation waveform can be finely controllable. SSTCs are used in most commercial, industrial, and research applications<ref name=\"Haddad\" /> as well as higher quality entertainment coils. \n**'''Single resonant solid state Tesla coil (SRSSTC)''' \u2013 In this circuit the primary does not have a resonant capacitor and so is not a tuned circuit; only the secondary is. The pulses of current to the primary from the switching transistors excite resonance in the secondary tuned circuit. Single tuned SSTCs are simpler, but the step-up ratio depends only on the high Q resonant (Q<sub>2</sub>) of the secondary side, and usually cannot produce as high voltage from a given input power as the DRSSTC.\n**'''Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil (DRSSTC)''' \u2013 The circuit is similar to the double tuned spark excited circuit, except in place of the spark gap semiconductor switches and an external medium-voltage power supply are used.  The fundamental difference is that they use the zero-state response of the system instead of the zero-input response.  Since the input energy is fed gradually they can generate higher voltage for a given input voltage than the SGTC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Queiroz|first=A.C.M.|date=2005|title=Multiple resonance networks with incomplete energy transfer and operating with zero-state response|journal=2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems|location=Kobe, Japan|publisher=IEEE|pages=236\u2013239|doi=10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1464568|isbn=978-0-7803-8834-5}}</ref>\n**'''[[Singing Tesla coil]]''' or '''musical Tesla coil''' \u2013 This is a Tesla coil which can be played like a musical instrument, with its high voltage discharges reproducing simple musical tones. The drive voltage pulses applied to the primary are modulated at an audio rate by a solid state \"interrupter\" circuit, causing the arc discharge from the high voltage terminal to emit sounds. Only tones and simple chords have been produced so far; the coil cannot function as a [[loudspeaker]], reproducing complex music or voice sounds. The sound output is controlled by a keyboard or [[MIDI file]] applied to the circuit through a [[MIDI]] interface. Two [[modulation]] techniques have been used: AM ([[amplitude modulation]] of the exciting voltage) and PFM ([[pulse-frequency modulation]]). These are mainly built as novelties for entertainment.\n*'''Continuous wave''' \u2013 In these the transformer is driven by a [[Electronic oscillator|feedback oscillator]], which applies a sinusoidal current to the transformer. The primary tuned circuit serves as the [[tank circuit]] of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a [[radio transmitter]]. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous [[sine wave]] output. Power [[vacuum tube]]s are often used as active devices instead of transistors because they are more robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given input power than pulsed excitation.\n\nTesla circuits can also be classified by how many [[electromagnetic coil|coils]] ([[inductor]]s) they contain:<ref name=\"Gerekos4\">[http://www.teslacoildesign.com/docs/TheTeslaCoil-Gerekos.pdf Gerekos, 2012, ''The Tesla Coil'', pp. 1, 23] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623223754/http://www.teslacoildesign.com/docs/TheTeslaCoil-Gerekos.pdf |date=June 23, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Denicolai4\">[http://www.saunalahti.fi/dncmrc1/lthesis.pdf Denicolai, 2001, ''Tesla Transformer for Experimentation and Research'', Ch. 2, p. 10]</ref>\n*'''Two coil''' or '''double-resonant''' circuits \u2013 Virtually all present Tesla coils use the two coil [[resonant transformer]], consisting of a primary winding to which current pulses are applied, and a secondary winding that produces the high voltage, invented by Tesla in 1891.

These typically consist of a primary [[tank circuit]], a series LC ([[inductance]]-[[capacitance]]) circuit composed of a high-voltage [[capacitor]], [[spark gap]] and [[primary coil]], and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the [[Secondary Coil|secondary coil]] plus a terminal capacitance or \"top load\". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving the bottom of a separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a [[capacitor]], the other 'plate' being the earth (or \"[[Ground (electricity)|ground]]\"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it [[resonate]]s at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from [[Metal spinning|spun metal]] or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field near the top of the secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.\n\nA more complex version of a Tesla coil, termed a \"magnifier\" by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core resonance \"driver\" transformer (or \"master oscillator\") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the \"extra coil\" or simply the [[resonator]]) that has a large number of turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected to the bottom of the extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1\" diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to \"ring up\" to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved.<ref name=\"Antonio1\">{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Antonio Carlos M. |title=Generalized Multiple LC Resonance Networks |journal=International Symposium on Circuits and Systems |publisher=IEEE |volume=3 |pages=519\u2013522 }}</ref> It is now known that a variety of useful tuning \"modes\" are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master oscillator.<ref name=\"Antonio2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/tesla/magnifier.html |title=Designing a Tesla Magnifier |last1=de Queiroz |first1=Antonio Carlos M. |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Primary switching ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n\nModern [[transistor]] or [[vacuum tube]] Tesla coils do not use a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, [[Rectifier|half-bridge]], or [[Power electronics#Single-phase full-bridge inverter|full-bridge]] arrangement of [[transistor|bipolar transistors]], [[MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator. The primary 'induces' alternating voltage into the bottom-most portion of the secondary, providing regular 'pushes' (similar to providing properly timed pushes to a playground swing). Additional energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary inductance and top-load capacitance during each \"push\", and secondary output voltage builds (called 'ring-up'). An electronic [[feedback]] circuit is usually used to adaptively synchronize the primary [[oscillator]] to the growing resonance in the secondary, and this is the only tuning consideration beyond the initial choice of a reasonable top-load.\n\n[[File:Maker Faire 2008 Tesla Coil.ogg|300px|thumb|Demonstration of the Nevada Lightning Laboratory 1:12 scale prototype twin Tesla Coil at [[Maker Faire]] 2008]]\nIn a dual resonant solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), the electronic switching of the solid-state Tesla coil is combined with the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series [[LC circuit|tank circuit]] with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an [[interrupter]] is usually used to reduce the [[duty cycle]] of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than [[bipolar transistor]]s or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.\n\n== Practical aspects of design ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n{{Section howto|date=June 2018}}\n\n=== High voltage production ===\nA large Tesla coil of more modern design often operates at very high peak power levels, up to many megawatts (millions of [[watt]]s<ref>This is equivalent to hundreds of thousands of [[horsepower]]</ref>). It is therefore adjusted and operated carefully, not only for efficiency and economy, but also for safety. If, due to improper tuning, the maximum voltage point occurs below the terminal, along the secondary coil, a discharge ([[Electrostatic discharge|spark]]) may break out and damage or destroy the coil wire, supports, or nearby objects.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = Tesla coil [[schematic]]s\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Tesla coil 3.svg\n | caption1 = Typical circuit configuration<br />Here, the spark gap shorts the high frequency across the first transformer that is supplied by alternating current. An inductance, not shown, protects the transformer. This design is favoured when a relatively fragile neon sign transformer is used.\n | image2 = Tesla coil 4.svg\n | caption2 = Alternative circuit configuration<br />With the capacitor in parallel to the first transformer and the spark gap in series to the Tesla-coil primary, the AC supply transformer must be capable of withstanding high voltages at high frequencies.\n}}\n\nTesla experimented with these, and many other, circuit configurations (see right). The Tesla coil primary winding, spark gap and tank capacitor are connected in series. In each circuit, the AC supply transformer charges the tank capacitor until its voltage is sufficient to break down the spark gap. The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.\n\nHowever, in the typical circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action prevents high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce [[corona discharge]]s between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as [[neon sign]] transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal [[leakage inductance]]. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.\n\n==== Tuning ====\nThe primary coil's resonant frequency is tuned to that of the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and retuning if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a \"breakout bump\") is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive \"loading\" by the streamers tends to lower the resonant frequency of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A toroid with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electrical field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a toroid permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus spark breakout voltage. A toroid's capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the spark breakout voltage is mainly a function of its minor diameter. A grid dip oscillator (GDO) is sometimes used to help facilitate initial tuning and aid in design. The resonant frequency of the secondary can be difficult to determine except by using a GDO or other experimental method, whereas the physical properties of the primary more closely represent lumped approximations of RF tank design. In this schema the secondary is built somewhat arbitrarily in imitation of other successful designs, or entirely so with supplies on hand, it's resonant frequency is measured and the primary designed to suit.\n\n==== Air discharges ====\n[[File:operating tesla coil.jpg|thumb|A small, later-type Tesla coil in operation: The output is giving {{nowrap|43-cm}} sparks. The diameter of the secondary is {{nowrap|8 cm}}. The power source is a {{nowrap|10 000 V,}} {{nowrap|60 [[Hertz|Hz]]}} [[current limiting|current-limited]] supply.]]\nWhile generating discharges, electrical energy from the secondary and toroid is transferred to the surrounding air as electrical charge, heat, light, and sound. The process is similar to charging or discharging a [[capacitor]], except that a Tesla coil uses AC instead of DC. The current that arises from shifting charges within a capacitor is called a [[displacement current]]. Tesla coil discharges are formed as a result of displacement currents as pulses of electrical charge are rapidly transferred between the high-voltage toroid and nearby regions within the air (called [[space charge]] regions). Although the space charge regions around the toroid are invisible, they play a profound role in the appearance and location of Tesla coil discharges.\n\nWhen the spark gap fires, the charged capacitor discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring energy into the secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs over a number of cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo [[dielectric breakdown]], forming a [[corona discharge]].\n\nAs the secondary coil's energy (and output voltage) continue to increase, larger pulses of displacement current further ionize and heat the air at the point of initial breakdown. This forms a very electrically conductive \"root\" of hotter [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], called a [[leader (spark)|leader]], that projects outward from the toroid. The plasma within the leader is considerably hotter than a corona discharge, and is considerably more conductive. In fact, its properties are similar to an [[electric arc]]. The leader tapers and branches into thousands of thinner, cooler, hair-like discharges (called streamers). The streamers look like a bluish 'haze' at the ends of the more luminous leaders. The streamers transfer charge between the leaders and toroid to nearby space charge regions. The displacement currents from countless streamers all feed into the leader, helping to keep it hot and electrically conductive.\n\nThe primary break rate of sparking Tesla coils is slow compared to the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over a short period of time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50\u2013500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, [[dynamic equilibrium]] is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage [[radio frequency]] envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.\n\n== Applications ==\nToday, although small Tesla coils are used as leak detectors in scientific high vacuum systems<ref name=\"Plesch\" /> and igniters in [[arc welding|arc welders]],<ref name=\"Gottlieb2\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Gottlieb\n | first1 = Irving \n | title = Practical Transformer Handbook\n | publisher = Newnes\n | date = 1998\n | page = 551\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HFFo2TNIu88C&pg=PA551&dq=tesla+welding \n | isbn = 978-0080514567\n }}</ref> their main use is entertainment and educational displays.\n\n===Education and entertainment===\n[[image:Electrumcrop.jpg|thumb|''[[Electrum (sculpture)|Electrum]]'' sculpture, the world's largest Tesla coil.

When the system is evacuated the high voltage electrode of the coil is played over the outside of the apparatus. At low pressures, air is more easily ionized and thus conducts electricity better than atmospheric pressure air.  Therefore, the discharge travels through any pin hole immediately below it, producing a [[corona discharge]] inside the evacuated space which illuminates the hole, indicating points that need to be annealed or reblown before they can be used in an experiment.\n\n==Health hazards==\nThe high voltage [[radio frequency]] (RF) discharges from the output terminal of a Tesla coil pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of [[electric shock]], as lower frequency AC or DC currents do.<ref name=\"Kluge\">{{cite web\n  | last = Kluge\n  | first = Stefan\n  | title = Safety page\n  | work = Stefan's Tesla coil pages\n  | publisher = Stefan Kluge's personal website\n  | date = 2009\n  | url = http://www.teslathon.de/stefan/tc/safety.htm\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Sprott\"/><ref name=\"Kov\u00e1cs2\">Kov\u00e1cs (1945) ''[https://archive.org/stream/electrotherapyli00kovrich#page/205/mode/2up   Electrotherapy and Light Therapy, 5th Ed.]'', pp. 205\u2013206</ref><ref name=\"Mieny\">{{cite book  \n  | last = Mieny\n  | first = C.

Each winding has a [[capacitance]] across it and functions as an [[LC circuit]] (resonant circuit, [[tuned circuit]]), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to the way a [[tuning fork]] stores vibrational mechanical energy. The [[primary winding|primary coil]] ''(L1)'' consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a [[capacitor]] ''(C1)'' through the [[spark gap]] ''(SG)''.<ref name=\"Haddad\" /><ref name=\"Naidu\" /> The [[secondary winding|secondary coil]] ''(L2)'' consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of ''(L2)'' resonates with stray capacitance ''(C2)'', the sum of the stray [[parasitic capacitance]] between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the [[toroid]]al metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal.  The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same [[resonant frequency]]. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates back and forth between the primary and secondary coils.\n\nThe peculiar design of the coil is dictated by the need to achieve low resistive energy losses ([[Q factor|high Q factor]]) at high frequencies,<ref name=\"Sprott\" /> which results in the largest secondary voltages:\n*Ordinary power transformers have an [[magnetic core|iron core]] to increase the magnetic coupling between the coils. However at high frequencies an iron core causes energy losses due to [[eddy current]]s and [[hysteresis]], so it is not used in the Tesla coil.<ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" />\n*Ordinary transformers are designed to be \"tightly coupled\". Due to the iron core and close proximity of the windings, they have a high [[mutual inductance]] ''(M)'', the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] is close to unity 0.95 \u2013 1.0, which means almost all the magnetic field of the primary winding passes through the secondary.<ref name=\"Gerekos\" /><ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" /> The Tesla transformer in contrast is \"loosely coupled\",<ref name=\"Haddad\" /><ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" /> the primary winding is larger in diameter and spaced apart from the secondary,<ref name=\"Naidu\" /> so the mutual inductance is lower and the coupling coefficient is only 0.05 to 0.2.<ref name=\"BurnettCouplingCoefficient\">{{cite web\n | last = Burnett\n | first = Richie\n | title = Coupling Coefficient\n | work = Richie's Tesla Coil Web Page\n | publisher = Richard Burnett private website\n | date = 2008\n | url = http://www.richieburnett.co.uk/operatn2.html#quenching\n | doi = \n | accessdate = April 4, 2017}}</ref> This means that only 5% to 20% of the magnetic field of the primary coil passes through the secondary when it is open circuited.<ref name=\"Haddad\" /><ref name=\"Denicolai2\" /> The loose coupling slows the exchange of energy between the primary and secondary coils, which allows the oscillating energy to stay in the secondary circuit longer before it returns to the primary and begins dissipating in the spark.\n*Each winding is also limited to a single layer of wire, which reduces [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] losses.

This completes the primary circuit and current from the capacitor flows through the primary coil ''(L1)''. The current flows rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil, generating radio frequency oscillating current in the primary circuit at the circuit's [[resonant frequency]].\n#The oscillating [[magnetic field]] of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding ''(L2)'', by [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits is limited to the energy originally stored in the capacitor ''C1'', so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude (\"ring up\") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero (\"ring down\"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance ''(C2)'', the sum of the [[parasitic capacitance]] between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode ''E''. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the primary voltage. \n#The secondary current creates a magnetic field that induces voltage back in the primary coil, and over a number of additional cycles the energy is transferred back to the primary. This process repeats, the energy shifting rapidly back and forth between the primary and secondary tuned circuits. The oscillating currents in the primary and secondary gradually die out (\"ring down\") due to energy dissipated as heat in the spark gap and resistance of the coil.\n#When the current through the spark gap is no longer sufficient to keep the air in the gap ionized, the spark stops (\"quenches\"), terminating the current in the primary circuit. The oscillating current in the secondary may continue for some time. \n#The current from the supply transformer begins charging the capacitor ''C1'' again and the cycle repeats.\n\nThis entire cycle takes place very rapidly, the oscillations dying out in a time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of [[damped wave]]s, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so there are more than a hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers from the top of the coil.\n\nThe supply transformer ''(T)'' secondary winding is connected across the primary tuned circuit. It might seem that the transformer would be a leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large [[inductance]] gives it a very high [[electrical impedance|impedance]] at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate [[leakage inductance]], radio frequency [[choke (electronics)|choke]]s are placed in its secondary leads to block the RF current.\n\n===Oscillation frequency===\nTo produce the largest output voltage, the primary and secondary tuned circuits are adjusted to [[resonance]] with each other.<ref name=\"Sprott\" /><ref name=\"Anderson\" /><ref name=\"Gerekos\" />  The [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of the primary and secondary circuits, <math>\\scriptstyle f_1</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle f_2</math>, are determined by the [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] in each circuit<ref name=\"Sprott\" /><ref name=\"Anderson\" /><ref name=\"Gerekos\" /> \n:<math>f_1 = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_1 C_1 }}} \\qquad \\qquad f_2 = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_2 C_2}}}\\,</math>\nGenerally the secondary is not adjustable, so the primary circuit is tuned, usually by a moveable tap on the primary coil L<sub>1</sub>, until it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary\n:<math>f = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_1 C_1}}} = {1 \\over {2\\pi \\sqrt {L_2 C_2}}}\\,</math>\nThus the condition for resonance between primary and secondary is\n:<math>L_1 C_1 = L_2 C_2\\,</math>\n\nThe resonant frequency of Tesla coils is in the low [[radio frequency]] (RF) range, usually between 50&nbsp;kHz and 1&nbsp;MHz.

This happens when the [[electric field]] strength exceeds the [[dielectric strength]] of the air, about 30&nbsp;kV per centimeter.  Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, air discharges start at these points on the high voltage terminal.  The voltage on the high voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air.  The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to less than one million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of [[Transformer oil|insulating oil]].\n\n===The top load or \"toroid\" electrode===\n[[File:OneTeslaTS DRSSTC Tesla Coil closeup.jpg|thumb|Solid state DRSSTC Tesla coil with pointed wire attached to toroid to produce [[brush discharge]] ]]\n\nMost Tesla coil designs have a smooth spherical or [[toroid]]al shaped metal electrode on the high voltage terminal.  The electrode serves as one plate of a [[capacitor]], with the Earth as the other plate, forming the [[tuned circuit]] with the secondary winding.  Although the \"toroid\" increases the secondary capacitance, which tends to reduce the peak voltage, its main effect is that its large diameter curved surface reduces the [[potential gradient]] ([[electric field]]) at the high voltage terminal; it functions similarly to a [[corona ring]], increasing the voltage threshold at which air discharges such as corona and brush discharges occur.<ref name=\"Denicolai5\">[http://www.saunalahti.fi/dncmrc1/lthesis.pdf Denicolai, 2001, ''Tesla Transformer for Experimentation and Research'', Ch.3, Sec. 3\u20135, p. 22]</ref> Suppressing premature air breakdown and energy loss allows the voltage to build to higher values on the peaks of the waveform, creating longer, more spectacular streamers when air discharges finally occur.<ref name=\"BurnettOperation\" />\n\nIf the top electrode is large and smooth enough, the electric field at its surface may never get high enough even at the peak voltage to cause air breakdown, and air discharges will not occur.

Spark gaps have disadvantages due to the high primary currents they must handle. They produce a very loud noise while operating, noxious [[ozone]] gas, and high temperatures which often require a cooling system. The energy dissipated in the spark also reduces the [[Q factor]] and the output voltage.  Tesla's coils were all spark-excited. \n**'''Static spark gap''' \u2013 This is the most common type, which was described in detail in the previous section. It is used in most entertainment coils. An AC voltage from a high voltage supply transformer charges a capacitor, which discharges through the spark gap. The spark rate is not adjustable but is determined by the line frequency and the gap breakdown voltage. Multiple sparks may occur on each half-cycle, so the pulses of output voltage may not be equally-spaced.\n**'''Static triggered spark gap''' \u2013 Commercial and industrial circuits often apply a DC voltage from a power supply to charge the capacitor, and use high voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering electrode to trigger the spark.<ref name=\"Haddad\" /> This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial spark gaps are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]], reducing the length and thus the energy loss in the spark.\n**'''Rotary spark gap''' \u2013 These use a spark gap consisting of electrodes around the periphery of a wheel rotated at high speed by a motor, which create sparks when they pass by a stationary electrode. Tesla used this type on his big coils, and they are used today on large entertainment coils. The rapid separation speed of the electrodes quenches the spark quickly, allowing \"first notch\" quenching, making possible higher voltages. The wheel is usually driven by a [[synchronous motor]], so the sparks are synchronized with the AC line frequency, the spark occurring at the same point on the AC waveform on each cycle, so the primary pulses are repeatable. \n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| header = \n| image1 = Simple SSTC.gif\n| caption1 = A simple single resonant solid state Tesla coil circuit in which the ground end of the secondary supplies the feedback current phase to the transistor oscillator.\n| width1 = 200\n| image2 = Current resonance drive tesla coil.gif\n| caption2 = This block diagram explains the principle of Tesla coil current resonance type driving circuit.\n| width2 = 224\n}}\n*'''Switched''' or '''Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC)''' \u2013 These use [[power semiconductor device]]s, usually [[thyristor]]s or [[transistor]]s such as [[MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s,<ref name=\"Haddad\" /> to switch pulses of voltage from a DC power supply through the primary winding. They provide pulsed  excitation without the disadvantages of a spark gap: the loud noise, high temperatures, and poor efficiency.  The voltage, frequency, and excitation waveform can be finely controllable. SSTCs are used in most commercial, industrial, and research applications<ref name=\"Haddad\" /> as well as higher quality entertainment coils. \n**'''Single resonant solid state Tesla coil (SRSSTC)''' \u2013 In this circuit the primary does not have a resonant capacitor and so is not a tuned circuit; only the secondary is. The pulses of current to the primary from the switching transistors excite resonance in the secondary tuned circuit. Single tuned SSTCs are simpler, but the step-up ratio depends only on the high Q resonant (Q<sub>2</sub>) of the secondary side, and usually cannot produce as high voltage from a given input power as the DRSSTC.\n**'''Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil (DRSSTC)''' \u2013 The circuit is similar to the double tuned spark excited circuit, except in place of the spark gap semiconductor switches and an external medium-voltage power supply are used.  The fundamental difference is that they use the zero-state response of the system instead of the zero-input response.  Since the input energy is fed gradually they can generate higher voltage for a given input voltage than the SGTC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Queiroz|first=A.C.M.|date=2005|title=Multiple resonance networks with incomplete energy transfer and operating with zero-state response|journal=2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems|location=Kobe, Japan|publisher=IEEE|pages=236\u2013239|doi=10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1464568|isbn=978-0-7803-8834-5}}</ref>\n**'''[[Singing Tesla coil]]''' or '''musical Tesla coil''' \u2013 This is a Tesla coil which can be played like a musical instrument, with its high voltage discharges reproducing simple musical tones. The drive voltage pulses applied to the primary are modulated at an audio rate by a solid state \"interrupter\" circuit, causing the arc discharge from the high voltage terminal to emit sounds. Only tones and simple chords have been produced so far; the coil cannot function as a [[loudspeaker]], reproducing complex music or voice sounds. The sound output is controlled by a keyboard or [[MIDI file]] applied to the circuit through a [[MIDI]] interface. Two [[modulation]] techniques have been used: AM ([[amplitude modulation]] of the exciting voltage) and PFM ([[pulse-frequency modulation]]). These are mainly built as novelties for entertainment.\n*'''Continuous wave''' \u2013 In these the transformer is driven by a [[Electronic oscillator|feedback oscillator]], which applies a sinusoidal current to the transformer. The primary tuned circuit serves as the [[tank circuit]] of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a [[radio transmitter]]. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous [[sine wave]] output.

These typically consist of a primary [[tank circuit]], a series LC ([[inductance]]-[[capacitance]]) circuit composed of a high-voltage [[capacitor]], [[spark gap]] and [[primary coil]], and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the [[Secondary Coil|secondary coil]] plus a terminal capacitance or \"top load\". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving the bottom of a separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a [[capacitor]], the other 'plate' being the earth (or \"[[Ground (electricity)|ground]]\"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it [[resonate]]s at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from [[Metal spinning|spun metal]] or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field near the top of the secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.\n\nA more complex version of a Tesla coil, termed a \"magnifier\" by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core resonance \"driver\" transformer (or \"master oscillator\") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the \"extra coil\" or simply the [[resonator]]) that has a large number of turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected to the bottom of the extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1\" diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to \"ring up\" to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved.<ref name=\"Antonio1\">{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Antonio Carlos M. |title=Generalized Multiple LC Resonance Networks |journal=International Symposium on Circuits and Systems |publisher=IEEE |volume=3 |pages=519\u2013522 }}</ref> It is now known that a variety of useful tuning \"modes\" are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master oscillator.<ref name=\"Antonio2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/tesla/magnifier.html |title=Designing a Tesla Magnifier |last1=de Queiroz |first1=Antonio Carlos M. |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Primary switching ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n\nModern [[transistor]] or [[vacuum tube]] Tesla coils do not use a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, [[Rectifier|half-bridge]], or [[Power electronics#Single-phase full-bridge inverter|full-bridge]] arrangement of [[transistor|bipolar transistors]], [[MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator. The primary 'induces' alternating voltage into the bottom-most portion of the secondary, providing regular 'pushes' (similar to providing properly timed pushes to a playground swing). Additional energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary inductance and top-load capacitance during each \"push\", and secondary output voltage builds (called 'ring-up'). An electronic [[feedback]] circuit is usually used to adaptively synchronize the primary [[oscillator]] to the growing resonance in the secondary, and this is the only tuning consideration beyond the initial choice of a reasonable top-load.\n\n[[File:Maker Faire 2008 Tesla Coil.ogg|300px|thumb|Demonstration of the Nevada Lightning Laboratory 1:12 scale prototype twin Tesla Coil at [[Maker Faire]] 2008]]\nIn a dual resonant solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), the electronic switching of the solid-state Tesla coil is combined with the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series [[LC circuit|tank circuit]] with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an [[interrupter]] is usually used to reduce the [[duty cycle]] of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than [[bipolar transistor]]s or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.\n\n== Practical aspects of design ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n{{Section howto|date=June 2018}}\n\n=== High voltage production ===\nA large Tesla coil of more modern design often operates at very high peak power levels, up to many megawatts (millions of [[watt]]s<ref>This is equivalent to hundreds of thousands of [[horsepower]]</ref>). It is therefore adjusted and operated carefully, not only for efficiency and economy, but also for safety. If, due to improper tuning, the maximum voltage point occurs below the terminal, along the secondary coil, a discharge ([[Electrostatic discharge|spark]]) may break out and damage or destroy the coil wire, supports, or nearby objects.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = Tesla coil [[schematic]]s\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Tesla coil 3.svg\n | caption1 = Typical circuit configuration<br />Here, the spark gap shorts the high frequency across the first transformer that is supplied by alternating current. An inductance, not shown, protects the transformer. This design is favoured when a relatively fragile neon sign transformer is used.\n | image2 = Tesla coil 4.svg\n | caption2 = Alternative circuit configuration<br />With the capacitor in parallel to the first transformer and the spark gap in series to the Tesla-coil primary, the AC supply transformer must be capable of withstanding high voltages at high frequencies.\n}}\n\nTesla experimented with these, and many other, circuit configurations (see right). The Tesla coil primary winding, spark gap and tank capacitor are connected in series. In each circuit, the AC supply transformer charges the tank capacitor until its voltage is sufficient to break down the spark gap. The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.\n\nHowever, in the typical circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action prevents high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce [[corona discharge]]s between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as [[neon sign]] transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal [[leakage inductance]]. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.\n\n==== Tuning ====\nThe primary coil's resonant frequency is tuned to that of the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and retuning if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a \"breakout bump\") is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive \"loading\" by the streamers tends to lower the resonant frequency of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A toroid with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electrical field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a toroid permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus spark breakout voltage. A toroid's capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the spark breakout voltage is mainly a function of its minor diameter. A grid dip oscillator (GDO) is sometimes used to help facilitate initial tuning and aid in design. The resonant frequency of the secondary can be difficult to determine except by using a GDO or other experimental method, whereas the physical properties of the primary more closely represent lumped approximations of RF tank design. In this schema the secondary is built somewhat arbitrarily in imitation of other successful designs, or entirely so with supplies on hand, it's resonant frequency is measured and the primary designed to suit.\n\n==== Air discharges ====\n[[File:operating tesla coil.jpg|thumb|A small, later-type Tesla coil in operation: The output is giving {{nowrap|43-cm}} sparks. The diameter of the secondary is {{nowrap|8 cm}}. The power source is a {{nowrap|10 000 V,}} {{nowrap|60 [[Hertz|Hz]]}} [[current limiting|current-limited]] supply.]]\nWhile generating discharges, electrical energy from the secondary and toroid is transferred to the surrounding air as electrical charge, heat, light, and sound. The process is similar to charging or discharging a [[capacitor]], except that a Tesla coil uses AC instead of DC. The current that arises from shifting charges within a capacitor is called a [[displacement current]]. Tesla coil discharges are formed as a result of displacement currents as pulses of electrical charge are rapidly transferred between the high-voltage toroid and nearby regions within the air (called [[space charge]] regions). Although the space charge regions around the toroid are invisible, they play a profound role in the appearance and location of Tesla coil discharges.\n\nWhen the spark gap fires, the charged capacitor discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring energy into the secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs over a number of cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo [[dielectric breakdown]], forming a [[corona discharge]].\n\nAs the secondary coil's energy (and output voltage) continue to increase, larger pulses of displacement current further ionize and heat the air at the point of initial breakdown. This forms a very electrically conductive \"root\" of hotter [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], called a [[leader (spark)|leader]], that projects outward from the toroid. The plasma within the leader is considerably hotter than a corona discharge, and is considerably more conductive. In fact, its properties are similar to an [[electric arc]]. The leader tapers and branches into thousands of thinner, cooler, hair-like discharges (called streamers). The streamers look like a bluish 'haze' at the ends of the more luminous leaders. The streamers transfer charge between the leaders and toroid to nearby space charge regions. The displacement currents from countless streamers all feed into the leader, helping to keep it hot and electrically conductive.\n\nThe primary break rate of sparking Tesla coils is slow compared to the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over a short period of time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50\u2013500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, [[dynamic equilibrium]] is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage [[radio frequency]] envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.\n\n== Applications ==\nToday, although small Tesla coils are used as leak detectors in scientific high vacuum systems<ref name=\"Plesch\" /> and igniters in [[arc welding|arc welders]],<ref name=\"Gottlieb2\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Gottlieb\n | first1 = Irving \n | title = Practical Transformer Handbook\n | publisher = Newnes\n | date = 1998\n | page = 551\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HFFo2TNIu88C&pg=PA551&dq=tesla+welding \n | isbn = 978-0080514567\n }}</ref> their main use is entertainment and educational displays.\n\n===Education and entertainment===\n[[image:Electrumcrop.jpg|thumb|''[[Electrum (sculpture)|Electrum]]'' sculpture, the world's largest Tesla coil.

Builders of Tesla coils as a hobby are called \"coilers\". They attend \"coiling\" conventions where they display their home-made Tesla coils and other high voltage devices.

In 1998, he named the character in the suit Doctor MegaVolt and has performed all over the world and at [[Burning Man]] nine different years.\n\nTesla coils can also be used to generate sounds, including music, by modulating the system's effective \"break rate\" (i.e., the rate and duration of high power RF bursts) via [[MIDI]] data and a control unit. The actual MIDI data is interpreted by a microcontroller which converts the MIDI data into a [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]] output which can be sent to the Tesla coil via a fiber optic interface.<ref>Interview with ArcAttack on [http://oddstrument.com/2008/05/20/arcattacks-musical-tesla-coils-shocking/ Odd Instruments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907173507/http://oddstrument.com/2008/05/20/arcattacks-musical-tesla-coils-shocking/ |date=2008-09-07}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hauntedfrog.com/gt/movies/2007/duckon/SingingTeslaShow.html Duckon 2007-Steve Ward's Singing Tesla Coil video<!-- Bot generated title -->]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623223754/http://www.hauntedfrog.com/gt/movies/2007/duckon/SingingTeslaShow.html |date=June 23, 2007}}</ref> The [[YouTube]] video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1O2jcfOylU Super Mario Brothers theme in stereo and harmony on two coils] shows a performance on matching solid state coils operating at 41&nbsp;kHz. The coils were built and operated by designer hobbyists Jeff Larson and Steve Ward. The device has been named the [[Zeusaphone]], after [[Zeus]], Greek god of lightning, and as a play on words referencing the [[Sousaphone]]. The idea of playing music on the [[singing Tesla coil]]s flies around the world and a few followers<ref name=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/teslamusicband\">[https://www.youtube.com/user/teslamusicband Tesla Music Band]</ref> continue the work of initiators. An extensive outdoor musical concert has demonstrated using Tesla coils during the Engineering Open House (EOH) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. The Icelandic artist [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used a Tesla coil in her song \"Thunderbolt\" as the main instrument in the song. The musical group [[ArcAttack]] uses modulated Tesla coils and a man in a chain-link suit to play music.\n\n===Vacuum system leak detectors===\nScientists working with high vacuum systems test for the presence of tiny pin holes in the apparatus (especially a newly blown piece of glassware) using high-voltage discharges produced by a small handheld Tesla coil. When the system is evacuated the high voltage electrode of the coil is played over the outside of the apparatus. At low pressures, air is more easily ionized and thus conducts electricity better than atmospheric pressure air.  Therefore, the discharge travels through any pin hole immediately below it, producing a [[corona discharge]] inside the evacuated space which illuminates the hole, indicating points that need to be annealed or reblown before they can be used in an experiment.\n\n==Health hazards==\nThe high voltage [[radio frequency]] (RF) discharges from the output terminal of a Tesla coil pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of [[electric shock]], as lower frequency AC or DC currents do.<ref name=\"Kluge\">{{cite web\n  | last = Kluge\n  | first = Stefan\n  | title = Safety page\n  | work = Stefan's Tesla coil pages\n  | publisher = Stefan Kluge's personal website\n  | date = 2009\n  | url = http://www.teslathon.de/stefan/tc/safety.htm\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Sprott\"/><ref name=\"Kov\u00e1cs2\">Kov\u00e1cs (1945) ''[https://archive.org/stream/electrotherapyli00kovrich#page/205/mode/2up   Electrotherapy and Light Therapy, 5th Ed.]'', pp. 205\u2013206</ref><ref name=\"Mieny\">{{cite book  \n  | last = Mieny\n  | first = C.
