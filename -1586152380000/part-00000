Bottke]], David Vokrouhlick\u00fd, and [[David Nesvorn\u00fd]], argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is [[298 Baptistina]]. They proposed that the \"Chicxulub asteroid\" was also a member of this group. The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor, suggesting the impactor was a member of a rare class of asteroids called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, like Baptistina.<ref name=Bottke/> According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about {{convert|170|km|abbr=on|0}} across, with the other impacting body being around {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=Bottke>Bottke, Vokrouhlicky, Nesvorny.</ref><ref>Ingham.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, new data from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] revised the date of the collision which created the [[Baptistina family]] to about 80 million years ago.

Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could have been caused by just such a large impact.<ref>Alvarez, W. interview.</ref> The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], and the start of the [[Paleogene]] period. It coincides with the K\u2013Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]], including the worldwide extinction of non-avian [[dinosaur]]s. This conclusion has been the source of controversy.\n\nIn March 2010, forty-one experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the [[mass extinction]]s at the K\u2013Pg boundary.<ref name=\"science\">Schulte, et al., 2010</ref><ref>Rincon.</ref> In 2013 a study compared [[isotope]]s in [[impact glass]] from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the [[extinction event]] occurred in the [[fossil record]]; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 \u00b1 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 \u00b1 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Renne|first1=Paul|url=https://eps.harvard.edu/files/eps/files/renne.kt_.science.2013.pdf|title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary|journal=Science|date=February 8, 2013|volume=339|issue=6120|pages=684\u20137|bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R|doi=10.1126/science.1230492|pmid=23393261}}</ref>\n\nThe theory is now widely accepted by the [[scientific community]].

In a March 2019 article in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], an international team of twelve scientists revealed the contents of the [[Tanis (fossil site)|Tanis fossil site]] discovered near [[Bowman, North Dakota]] that appeared to show the destruction of an ancient lake and its inhabitants at the time of the Chicxulub impact. In the paper, the group claims that the geology of the site is strewn with [[fossil]]ized trees and remains of fish and other animals. The lead researcher, Robert A. DePalma of the [[University of Kansas]], was quoted in the New York Times as stating that \"[Y]ou would be blind to miss the carcasses sticking out... It is impossible to miss when you see the outcrop.\"  Evidence correlating this find to the Chicxulub impact included [[tektites]] bearing \"the unique chemical signature of other tektites associated with the Chicxulub event\" found in the gills of fish fossils and embedded in [[amber]], an iridium-rich top layer that is considered another signature of the event, and an atypical lack of scavenging of the dead fish and animals that suggested few other species survived the event to feed off the mass death. The exact mechanism of the site's destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused [[tsunami]] or lake and river [[seiche]] activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes; there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ku.edu/2019/03/29/stunning-discovery-offers-glimpse-minutes-following-%E2%80%98dinosaur-killer%E2%80%99-chicxulub-impact|title=Stunning discovery offers glimpse of minutes following 'dinosaur-killer' Chicxulub impact|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/science/dinosaurs-extinction-asteroid.html|title=Fossil Site Reveals Day That Meteor Hit Earth and, Maybe, Wiped Out Dinosaurs|date=March 29, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Broad|first1=William J.|last2=Chang|first2=Kenneth}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple impact hypothesis==\nIn recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N.

He then obtained onshore [[Gravity anomaly|gravity data]] from the 1940s.  According to Penfield, \"The old data showed a large concentric set of onshore gravity anomalies.

Coincidentally, many experts in [[impact crater]]s and the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary|K\u2013Pg (Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene) boundary]] were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.<ref name=bates/>\n\nHe knew Pemex had drilled exploratory wells in the region. In 1951, one bored into what was described as a thick layer of [[andesite]] about {{convert|1.3|km|ft|sp=us}} down. This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact, but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a [[lava dome]]\u2014a feature uncharacteristic of the region's geology. Penfield tried to secure site samples, but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed.<ref name=bates/> When attempts at returning to the drill sites and looking for rocks proved fruitless, Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings and returned to his Pemex work.\n\nAt the same time, in 1980, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]] and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist [[Luis Walter Alvarez]], put forth [[Alvarez hypothesis|their hypothesis]] that a large extraterrestrial body had struck Earth at the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary.

They proposed that the \"Chicxulub asteroid\" was also a member of this group. The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor, suggesting the impactor was a member of a rare class of asteroids called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, like Baptistina.<ref name=Bottke/> According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about {{convert|170|km|abbr=on|0}} across, with the other impacting body being around {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=Bottke>Bottke, Vokrouhlicky, Nesvorny.</ref><ref>Ingham.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, new data from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] revised the date of the collision which created the [[Baptistina family]] to about 80 million years ago.

Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could have been caused by just such a large impact.<ref>Alvarez, W. interview.</ref> The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], and the start of the [[Paleogene]] period. It coincides with the K\u2013Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]], including the worldwide extinction of non-avian [[dinosaur]]s. This conclusion has been the source of controversy.\n\nIn March 2010, forty-one experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the [[mass extinction]]s at the K\u2013Pg boundary.<ref name=\"science\">Schulte, et al., 2010</ref><ref>Rincon.</ref> In 2013 a study compared [[isotope]]s in [[impact glass]] from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the [[extinction event]] occurred in the [[fossil record]]; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 \u00b1 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 \u00b1 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Renne|first1=Paul|url=https://eps.harvard.edu/files/eps/files/renne.kt_.science.2013.pdf|title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary|journal=Science|date=February 8, 2013|volume=339|issue=6120|pages=684\u20137|bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R|doi=10.1126/science.1230492|pmid=23393261}}</ref>\n\nThe theory is now widely accepted by the [[scientific community]].

In the paper, the group claims that the geology of the site is strewn with [[fossil]]ized trees and remains of fish and other animals. The lead researcher, Robert A.

The exact mechanism of the site's destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused [[tsunami]] or lake and river [[seiche]] activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes; there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ku.edu/2019/03/29/stunning-discovery-offers-glimpse-minutes-following-%E2%80%98dinosaur-killer%E2%80%99-chicxulub-impact|title=Stunning discovery offers glimpse of minutes following 'dinosaur-killer' Chicxulub impact|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/science/dinosaurs-extinction-asteroid.html|title=Fossil Site Reveals Day That Meteor Hit Earth and, Maybe, Wiped Out Dinosaurs|date=March 29, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Broad|first1=William J.|last2=Chang|first2=Kenneth}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple impact hypothesis==\nIn recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N.

He never met his father, who was killed in action, while served as sergeant with the [[British Army]] during the [[battle of the Somme]] on July 1, 1916. His mother Florence joined newly established [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] and young Ronald grew up with the relatives.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

She fell in love with him, but due to end of the War, Antonius sailed back to the United States. Florence maintained correspondence with him for almost next two years and finally took young Ronald and left for United States in the spring of 1920.<ref name=\"Kentucky Humanities\" /><ref name=\"The Sentinel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sentinelnews.com/content/van-stockum-early-years-centenarian-part-1-recalling-past-100-years-or-so|title= The Early years of a Centenarian: Recalling the past 100 years or so |publisher=The Sentinel News|location= Shelbyville, Kentucky |date= July 25, 2018|accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nBecause his mother Florence was not a U.S. citizen, she was denied entry to the United States. The only obvious solution of the problem was marriage with Antonius. They were married on May 20, 1920 and Florence and infant Ronald were allowed to entry into the United States. Ronald was also adopted by Antonius and renamed Van Stockum.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nRonald grew up in Washington state and completed the grade school in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. He later graduated from the high school in [[Yakima, Washington]], and entered the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], where he graduated in June 1937 with [[bachelor's degree]]. During his time at the university, he completed the [[ROTC]] course and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Also, he was active on the [[YMCA]] student board.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nFollowing his graduation, Van Stockum was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on August 4, 1937, and ordered to [[the Basic School]] at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] for Marine Corps Officer instruction. Van Stockum had the opportunity to work with great names in the modern Marine Corps history like, for example, [[Gilder D. Jackson Jr.]], [[Chesty Puller]], [[Leonard B. Cresswell]], [[Frank B. Goettge]], [[Russell N. Jordahl]], [[Walfried M. Fromhold]], [[Howard N. Kenyon]] and [[Roy M. Gulick]], who served as instructors during his time at the school. At the end of instruction, Van Stockum received the highest marks in Drill and Command.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n[[File:2dLt Ronald R. Van Stockum.jpg|left|thumb|Van Stockum as a 2nd Lieutenant in June 1939.]]\nHe completed the school at the end of May 1938 and travelled to the West Coast. Van Stockum subsequently completed Secondary Battery Gunnery School on board [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'']] and then joined the Marine detachment aboard the battleship [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|USS ''Tennessee'']], anchored off [[San Pedro, California]]. which was subsequently ordered to New York through the [[Panama Canal]] for participation in [[Fleet Problem XX]] and \u201cshowing the flag\u201d at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair of 1939]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nAfter one year of sea duties, Van Stockum was ordered to [[San Diego]] in mid-May 1939 and attached to the [[1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver P. Smith]]. He remained with that unit until January 1941 and then was ordered again for sea duties as a member of the Marine detachment aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|USS ''Wasp'']]. He subsequently participated in the [[Neutrality patrol]]s in the stretch between [[Bermuda]] and [[Hampton Roads]] and following the United States entry into World War II, Van Stockum was promoted to the rank of captain in February 1942 and succeeded Captain [[August Larson]] in command of the detachment aboard. He then participated in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|relief of Malta]], when ''Wasp'' delivered two sets of 47 [[Spitfire]]s fighter planes within the Operations  [[Operation Calendar|Calendar]] and [[Operation Bowery|Bowery]] in April and May 1942.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" />\n\nVan Stockum was then transferred from the ''Wasp'' and was assigned to [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], where, having been promoted to the rank of Major, he formed the Heavy Weapons Company, Company D, [[21st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 21st Marines]] under lieutenant colonel Ernest W. Fry Jr. The ''Wasp'' left for the Southwest Pacific shortly thereafter and was sunk off [[Guadalcanal]] on September 15, 1942. His relief, Captain John Kennedy, was lost in the sinking.\n\nHis battalion was ordered to [[San Diego]], [[California]] in July 1942 and Van Stockum assumed duty as battalion's executive officer. His unit was ordered to the Pacific Area in early 1943 and arrived to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] on February 20. Van Stockum participated in the intensive training on [[Guadalcanal]] until November 1943, when he sailed for forthcoming campaign \u2013 [[Bougainville Island]], [[North Solomon Islands]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" />\n\nVan Stockum participated in the amphibious landing on [[Cape Torokina]] on November 6 and spent almost two months in rain and mud conditions. He also took part in the [[Battle of Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A|battle of Hellzapoppin Ridge]] at the beginning of December 1943 and except the several front-line inspections, he spent an night in a foxhole. Van Stockum later assumed additional responsibility as commander of Battalion's [[Weapons company]] and remained on Bougainville until January 9, 1944, when 21st Regiment was ordered back to Guadalcanal. Van Stockum was decorated with the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[\"V\" Device|Combat \"V\"]] for his service on Bougainville.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" /><ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nFollowing the period of training, Van Stockum sailed with 1st Battalion to Guam on July 21, 1944, and went ashore with first waves of troops on Asan Beach. During a vicious Japanese counter attack the night of July 25-26, he proceeded alone to the front lines located at the top of a cliff. Here he reported by radio that the front lines had held even though the Japanese had infiltrated and passed down the valleys to attack the rear installations.\n\nAfter this campaign, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and assumed command of [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines]] under Colonel [[James A. Stuart]]. He subsequently spent several months on Guam with mopping-up operations against scattered Japanese soldiers. His battalion was scheduled to take part in the [[battle of Iwo Jima]] in February 1945, but remained in floating reserve and did not go ashore.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

Pickett]]. He was engaged in training of Army and Marine units in Amphibious Operations until January 1947, when he was ordered to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], for duty as Inspector-Instructor with 4th Marine Reserve Infantry Battalion.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" /><ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\n===Incident in Minneapolis===\n\nThe Inspector-Instructor, a regular officer with a small staff, provided administrative and logistic support to a reserve unit composed of officers and men who came on duty a weekend a month for training.  The commanding officer was a reserve officer, actually in command of the unit, who actually relied heavily on the advice of his regular counterpart. This assignment in Minneapolis later showed as crucial in his career. Van Stockum had conflict with the reserve Colonel, a commanding officer of the battalion who had a drinking problem. Van Stockum reported this incident to the director of marine reserve district, Colonel [[Walker A. Reaves]], who requested official investigation. The Inspector general, Brigadier General [[Robert Blake (USMC)|Robert Blake]], sent Colonel [[James M. Masters Sr.]], who found Van Stockum's complaint legitimate and relieved reserve Colonel of his command. He was also supported in a private letter from the director, [[Marine Corps Reserve]], Brigadier General [[William T. Clement]]. This whole incident will be reflected later during his promotion to the general's rank.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\n===1947\u20131962===\n\nVan Stockum was transferred to the same position with reserve battalion in [[New York City]] in June 1948 and remained in that command for one year. He was subsequently ordered to the Senior Course at the Amphibious Warfare School at [[Quantico, Virginia]]. Van Stockum graduated in June 1950 and assumed duty as Senior Marine Officer, Amphibious Group Two under Rear Admiral [[Harold D. Baker]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nDuring this assignment he participated in an amphibious exercise at [[Onslow Beach]] near [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]] and later attended the winter course at the Army Arctic Indoctrination School in [[Big Delta, Alaska]]. Also, during this tour, Van Stockum and his command participated in [[Operation Blue Jay]] above the Arctic Circle at [[Thule, Greenland]], in cooperation with the Army Transportation Corps, the U.S. Air Force, and civilian contractors for the construction of the airbase in that area. He was promoted to colonel in July 1951.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nVan Stockum was transferred to the [[Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois|Naval Training Center, Great Lakes]], [[Illinois]], in July 1952 and assumed duty as commanding officer of the Marine detachment there and district Marine officer. It was during the [[Korean War]], when many sailors and marines deserted or were [[AWOL]]. They were confined here waiting trial, awaiting bad conduct or undesirable discharges or serving short sentences.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n[[File:Col Ronald R.

Riseley]]. Van Stockum served as a divisional intelligence officer (G-2) until June of the following year and then joined the Headquarters of [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]] in [[Tokyo]] under General [[Lyman Lemnitzer]]. He served as Lemnitzer's commandant of the headquarters. Van Stockum remained in this capacity until the end of June 1957 and received [[Commendation Medal|Army Commendation Medal]] from general Lemnitzer for his service in the [[Far East]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nFollowing his return to the United States in August 1957, Van Stockum was ordered to the instruction at [[Royal Military College of Canada]] at [[Fort Frontenac]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He graduated in July 1958 and reported to [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] under Major General [[Joseph C. Burger]] as deputy chief of staff. His tour of duty with 2nd Marine Division continued when Van Stockum assumed command of [[8th Marine Regiment (United States)|8th Marine Regiment]] at the beginning of July 1959.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nA new divisional commander, Major General [[James P. Berkeley]], appointed Van Stockum as Divisional Inspector in June 1960. As Division Inspector Van Stockum had the responsibility of scheduling inspections, conducting inspections personally, and accompanying the Commanding general (CG) on his inspections. He also processed disciplinary matters for action by the CG, interviewing personnel who were requesting personal interviews with the CG, etc. Van Stockum had also some difficulties with the commanding officer of the 6th Marines, Colonel [[Melvin D. Henderson]], who sometimes objected the decisions which Van Stockum conveyed from the CG.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nHe was appointed Divisional Chief of Staff in February 1961 and was co-responsible for the organization of Operation Old-Timer, social event made to the 20th Birthday of 2nd Marine Division. During this event, Van Stockum met many important leaders from divisional history, retired Generals [[Franklin A. Hart]], [[Edwin A. Pollock]], [[Lewis B. Puller]], [[Thomas E. Watson]], [[Julian C. Smith]] or [[Clayton B. Vogel]].<ref name=\"Ronald R.

Fairbourn]] as director, [[Marine Corps Reserve]] where he had responsibility for all Reserve units and activities for the entire Marine Corps. Van Stockum was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on July 1, 1962. He developed a good relationship with his direct superior, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[David M. Shoup]], and regularly played golf with him.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

It was the same unit which he was assigned to in April 1945. Its purpose remained the same, the training of Army and Marine units in Amphibious Operations. Within this command, Van Stockum toured Western Pacific and inspected his teams, which trained allies of the United States in [[amphibious warfare]]. He was invited to [[Tsoying]], [[Taiwan]] in October 1964 by Lieutenant General Yu Hao-chang, Commandant of the Chinese (Taiwan) Marine Corps and later visited senior commanders in [[Hawaii]], [[Tokyo]], [[Yokosuka]], [[Atsugi]], and [[Iwakuni]], [[Japan]], [[Okinawa]], [[South Korea]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Bangkok]], [[Manila]].<ref name=\"Ronald R.

He never met his father, who was killed in action, while served as sergeant with the [[British Army]] during the [[battle of the Somme]] on July 1, 1916.

She fell in love with him, but due to end of the War, Antonius sailed back to the United States.

The only obvious solution of the problem was marriage with Antonius. They were married on May 20, 1920 and Florence and infant Ronald were allowed to entry into the United States. Ronald was also adopted by Antonius and renamed Van Stockum.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nRonald grew up in Washington state and completed the grade school in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. He later graduated from the high school in [[Yakima, Washington]], and entered the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], where he graduated in June 1937 with [[bachelor's degree]].

The commanding officer was a reserve officer, actually in command of the unit, who actually relied heavily on the advice of his regular counterpart. This assignment in Minneapolis later showed as crucial in his career. Van Stockum had conflict with the reserve Colonel, a commanding officer of the battalion who had a drinking problem. Van Stockum reported this incident to the director of marine reserve district, Colonel [[Walker A. Reaves]], who requested official investigation. The Inspector general, Brigadier General [[Robert Blake (USMC)|Robert Blake]], sent Colonel [[James M. Masters Sr.]], who found Van Stockum's complaint legitimate and relieved reserve Colonel of his command.

{"title_page": "Overlapping markup", "text_new": "In [[markup language]]s and the [[digital humanities]], '''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to (...) linguistically annotated data [was] to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\">{{cite journal |last1=Ide |first1=Nancy |last2=Chiarcos |first2=Christian |last3=Stede |first3=Manfred |last4=Cassidy |first4=Steve |title=Designing Annotation Schemes: From Model to Representation |journal=Nancy Ide & James Pustejowsky (eds.), Handbook of Linguistic Annotation |date=2017 |page=99 |pages=|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9789402408799 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}</ref> \n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,<ref name=\"habla-p99\">{{cite journal |last1=Chiarcos |first1=Christian |last2=Dipper |first2=Stefanie |last3=G\u00f6tze |first3=Michael |last4=Leser |first4=Ulf |last5=L\u00fcdeling |first5=Anke |last6=Ritz |first6=Julia |last7=Stede |first7=Manfred |title=A flexible framework for integrating annotations from different tools and tagsets |journal=Traitement Automatique des Languages |date=2008 |volume=49 |issue=2 |page=271-293 |url=https://www.atala.org/content/flexible-framework-integrating-annotations-different-tools-and-tag-sets}}</ref> and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\nA disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\"/> In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== New languages ===\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

'''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem

techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to (...) linguistically annotated data [was] to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ide |first1=Nancy |last2=Chiarcos |first2=Christian |last3=Stede |first3=Manfred |last4=Cassidy |first4=Steve |title=Designing Annotation Schemes: From Model to Representation |journal=Nancy Ide & James Pustejowsky (eds.), Handbook of Linguistic Annotation |date=2017 |page=99 |pages=73-112 |url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9789402408799 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}</ref> \n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,<ref name=\"habla-p99\">{{cite journal |last1=Chiarcos |first1=Christian |last2=Dipper |first2=Stefanie |last3=G\u00f6tze |first3=Michael |last4=Leser |first4=Ulf |last5=L\u00fcdeling |first5=Anke |last6=Ritz |first6=Julia |last7=Stede |first7=Manfred |title=A flexible framework for integrating annotations from different tools and tagsets |journal=Traitement Automatique des Languages |date=2008 |volume=49 |issue=2 |page=271-293 |url=https://www.atala.org/content/flexible-framework-integrating-annotations-different-tools-and-tag-sets}}</ref> and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\nA disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\"/> In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== New languages ===\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

Jules initially declines, opting instead to meet up with an older man from a hookup app. Rue gets home late one night and her mother forces her to take a drug test. In order to pass it, Rue acquires clean urine by asking her childhood friend Lexi for some of hers. Lexi's sister Cassie is dating McKay, who discusses Cassie's sexual past with his friend Nate. Jules arrives at the motel where the older man told her to meet him. She lies about her age and the two have sex, after which she makes her way to the party.

One night, he discovers his father's hidden stash of homemade porn featuring gay men and trans women. He becomes a successful high school quarterback, but his adolescence is marked by anger issues, a discomfort around naked men, and an aggressive attitude towards Maddy. In the present day, Nate breaks into Tyler's house and violently assaults him, accusing him of raping Maddy, who falsely claimed she blacked out during the night of the party. On the first day of school, Rue breaks down in tears and runs out of gym class after being asked to talk about her summer, during which her overdose took place. Lexi attempts to comfort her, but is rejected. Rue reminisces about trying [[oxycodone]] for the first time at the age of 13, while her father was dying of cancer. Kat finds out that a sex tape from the party was filmed and uploaded online, but denies it is her. After finding more copies of the video online, Kat realizes that she can make money off of men's attraction to her. Jules starts talking with an anonymous closeted jock online. Rue finds Fezco with a drug dealer, who forces Rue to take [[fentanyl]] while Fezco watches. Afterwards, Fezco calls Jules for help with Rue's deteriorating situation. Meanwhile, McKay visits Cassie and is frustrated at her for making their interactions so sexually charged. It is revealed that the man Jules is talking to online is Nate. She asks what his name is, and he tells her it is \"Tyler\".\n----\nThe title of this episode is a reference to the 2006 [[Birdman (rapper)| Birdman]] and [[Lil Wayne]] song \"[[Stuntin' Like My Daddy]]\", the first single from their collaborative studio album, ''[[Like Father, Like Son (Birdman and Lil Wayne album)| Like Father, Like Son]]''.\n |LineColor=643190\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Made You Look\n |DirectedBy=Sam Levinson\n |WrittenBy=Sam Levinson\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2019|6|30}}\n |Viewers= 0.493<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-6-30-2019.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 6.30.2019|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=July 2, 2019|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=July 2, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary= While on vacation, a young Kat abruptly gains weight. Her boyfriend Daniel breaks up with her, and she is ostracized by her peers. Later, she becomes a popular online fan fiction writer. In the present, Kat starts hosting cam sessions and uses the money to buy a new wardrobe. Following the fentanyl incident, Jules tells Rue she will not be friends with her if she keeps using drugs. At her Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Rue talks about being 60 days sober, but another attendee named Ali reveals he knows Rue is lying. Later, Rue helps Jules take nude photos of herself after Nate sends her a \"[[Sexting|dick pic]]\". Afterwards, Rue steals pills from Jules' kitchen. Cassie goes to a frat party with McKay, while a confused Maddy finds many dick pics on Nate's phone. Rue and Jules argue after Jules reveals her plans to meet \"Tyler\" alone at night.
