Fireman challenged corporate America to become more socially responsible and demonstrated that all corporations could succeed financially, while simultaneously serving the public good. He sold Reebok to Adidas in 2006, but his life and business ventures continue to reflect his philanthropy in serving people and communities throughout the country today. \n\n==Early Life and Education==\nFireman was born February 14, 1944 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref name=rynecki>{{cite news|last1=Rynecki|first1=David|title=FIREMAN'S FANTASY|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/17/8358052/index.htm|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=Fortune|date=17 October 2005}}</ref> and raised in the working-class city of [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], also called 'Shoe City'.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

(DC Comics)|Invasion!]]''. Events at the end of the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode \"[[Medusa (Supergirl)|Medusa]]\" on November 28, 2016, marked the beginning of the crossover, which began on November 29 with ''The Flash'', continued on ''Arrow'' on November 30, and concluded on ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on December 1. Each of the main three episodes were titled \"Invasion!\". In the crossover, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] recruits [[Kara Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers / Supergirl]] from Earth-38 to Earth-1 to help his team, [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and his team, and the [[Legends of Tomorrow (team)|Legends]] to defeat the alien race known as the [[Dominators (Arrowverse)|Dominators]].\n\nDevelopment of a crossover between the three series and ''Supergirl'' began in May 2016, when it was learned that ''Supergirl'' would move to The CW from [[CBS]] for its second season. By the following September the scripts for each episode were written, and were filmed in October 2016. The premise and episode titles were also announced in September. In \"Invasion!\", the main cast members of each series appear in (at least) their own series; [[Melissa Benoist]] appears as Supergirl in the entire crossover. A number of actors and characters from previous ''Arrow'' seasons returned to reprise their roles, since ''Arrow''{{'}}s episode doubled as its [[100 episodes|100th]].\n\nThe three episodes of the crossover received positive reviews, with critics praising the interaction among the actors in each series and each episode's advancing season storylines as part of the crossover. The Dominators storyline was regarded as its weakest link, with reviewers finding the alien race's motivations unclear. Ratings for the episodes were high, with each breaking records in viewership and the 18\u201349 rating and contributing to the most-watched week on The CW in six years. A fourth crossover, \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\", occurred the following year.<ref name=\"Crisis\" />\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[Barry Allene (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] investigates aa meteor crash outside [[Central City (Arrowverse)|Central City]] which is a spaceship from which aliens emerge. [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] tells the team that the [[Dominators (Arrowverse)|Dominators]] had landed during the 1950s, but mysteriousley departed. Barry assembles the original members of Team Arrow, [[Thea Queen]], the [[Legends (superhero team)|Legends]], and [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers]], Supergirl of Earth-38. The team begins training at a [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] facility, sparring with Supergirl to prepare for the aliens. Kara struggles to earn [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]]'s trust. [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] finds and reveals a message Barry's future self sent to [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]], which exposes Barry's manipulation of the timeline and its effect on other team members. As a result, only Oliver, Kara, [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]], [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson]], and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] still trust Barry.\n\nAfter the Dominators abduct the President of the United States, the team goes to rescue him; however, Barry remains behind since most of them distrust him with Oliver staying behind in support of Barry. Kara leads the group, but the Dominators kill the President and activate a [[mind control]] device to take over the group. The controlled heroes return and attack S.T.A.R. Labs, where Barry and Oliver confront them. While Oliver holds them off, Barry lures Kara to the device and manipulates her into destroying it, freeing everyone from the Dominators' control. When the team regroups, [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] tells Barry that everyone forgives and trusts him. [[Sara Lance]], Ray, [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]], Thea, and Oliver are then abducted by the Dominators.\n\nThey are held in pods on a Dominators' ship, each one unconscious except for a shared [[hallucination]] of [[simulated reality]]. In the hallucination, Oliver is living at Queen Manor, [[Pilot (Arrow)#Plot|having never gotten on the ''Queen's Gambit'']], and is about to be married to [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]]. His parents are alive, and Diggle is operating as the vigilante the Hood, instead of Oliver. The captives begin seeing flashes of their real lives, and realize what the Dominators have done to them. Their escape attempt is blocked by personifications of their enemies: [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Deathstroke]] and two of his Mirakuru soldiers (who killed Ray's fianc\u00e9e Anna Loring), and [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]] and two of his [[H.I.V.E. (Arrowverse)|H.I.V.E.]] soldiers. The adversaries are defeated, and the five awaken in the Dominators' ship and escape in a shuttle. Felicity, [[Curtis Holt (Arrowverse)|Curtis Holt]], and Cisco try to hack into the Dominators' mainframe. Aided by Barry and Kara, they recover a device to locate the captives, who are rescued by [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood]] in the time ship, ''Waverider''. Aboard the ''Waverider'', Ray deduces that the Dominators were gathering information about [[metahumans]], using the hallucination as a distraction, to help them build a special \"weapon\". Meanwhile, the Dominator [[mothership]] heads towards Earth.\n\nNate says that the first Dominator invasion occurred in 1951 in [[Redmond, Oregon]]. He goes there with fellow Legends [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] and [[Amaya Jiwe]] and Felicity and Cisco to kidnap a Dominator for information. Although they are successful, the three Legends and their alien captive are taken prisoner by [[National Security Agency|N.S.A. agents]]. The Legends learn from the Dominator that the aliens have arrived to assess humanity's threat, now that metahumans have appeared and formed the [[Justice Society of America]]. Felicity and Cisco rescue the Legends, and also set the Dominator free, carelessly altering history. In 2016 Central City, the team learns that the Dominators know about Barry's manipulation of the timeline, deem him a threat, and are demanding his surrender in exchange for peace. After the Legends return, the team discovers that the Dominators' weapon is a bomb that will kill all metahumans on Earth, with millions of collateral human casualties. The teams dissuade Barry from surrendering, and he and Cisco reconcile. The team manage to destroy the bomb and force the Dominators to retreat with a pain-inflicting [[nanotechnology|nano-weapon]]. As the heroes celebrate their victory, Oliver offers Kara his friendship; Cisco gives her a device which will enable her to interdimensional travel and communicate between Earth-1 and Earth-38. Martin persuades Jax not to tell the others that his daughter Lily's existence is the result of a [[temporal paradox]] he inadvertently caused when the Legends were in 1987.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

He added that it would have been logistically difficult to incorporate the four series, noting that finding the time for [[Melissa Benoist]] to shoot material for the other three series was complicated. Benoist did not appear in much of \"[[The Darkest Place]]\", the episode before \"Medusa\", to make her available to appear in each of the crossover episodes.<ref name=\"KreisbergIGN\" /> He expanded on the difficulties, saying that \"built-in shut-down days\" for ''Supergirl'' were not planned on, in part because the series switched from CBS to The CW, and that this inability to shut down normal production prevented it from having a larger role in the crossover.<ref name=\"EWFeb2017\" />\n\nIt was announced the following September that the villains in the event would be the [[Dominators (Arrowverse)|Dominators]], in a story inspired by the 1989 comic miniseries ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]''<ref name=\"DominatorsReveal\" /> The Dominators were chosen because the writers \"collectively wanted the superheroes to face an external threat,\" meaning \"a threat that came from outside of the shows\", rather than extraterrestrial.<ref name=\"DominatorsReason\" /> The following month, ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' creator and executive producer [[Marc Guggenheim]] said that the title of each episode of the crossover would be \"Invasion!\".<ref name=\"InvasionTitle\" />\n\nIn November 2016, Kreisberg said that the Dominators would appear during the later part of ''Supergirl''{{'}}s season after the crossover event.<ref name=\"DominatorsSupergirl\" /> Guggenheim said that in the initial script for ''The Flash'', [[Lynda Carter]] appeared as the Vice President (becoming President after his death in the episode); Carter appears as President Olivia Marsdin on ''Supergirl''. This did not occur because a note from the studio felt it would have been too confusing, having Marsdin appear as president on one series (and another Earth) and vice president on the others. Guggenheim added, \"In the midst of time travel and aliens, it was just one sci-fi problem too much\" and conceded that \"if people at the studio were confused by the script, it was probably not particularly friendly to casual fans.\"<ref name=\"LyndaCarter\" />\n\n===Writing===\nScripts for \"Invasion!\" were written in mid-September 2016, with Berlanti creating the story for the event and Kreisberg helping to craft the story of ''The Flash'' episode.<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /><ref name=\"LoTProduction\" /><ref name=\"FlashProduction\" /> The teleplay for ''The Flash'' was written by [[showrunners]] [[Aaron and Todd Helbing]];<ref name=\"FlashProduction\" /> ''Arrow''{{'}}s was written by showrunners Guggenheim and [[Wendy Mericle]],<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /> and showrunners [[Phil Klemmer]] and Guggenheim wrote the teleplay for ''Legends of Tomorrow''.<ref name=\"LoTProduction\" /> When the Dominators were chosen as the threat for the crossover, the writers were able to justify the heroes' uniting; since Supergirl \"is knowledgeable about these particular enemies, the Legends can help better understand the last time the Dominators visited Earth thanks to their time travel capabilities, and both Teams Flash and Arrow have a diverse array of capable heroes who are able to understand and counter just about every imaginable threat.\"<ref name=\"DominatorsReason\" />\n\n''Arrow''{{'}}s episode in the crossover was also the series' 100th. Guggenheim said that Berlanti's idea for the episode \"allow[ed] us to have our cake and eat it too\" in respecting ''Arrow'' as a whole and incorporating it into the crossover, with Guggenheim calling it \"a love letter\" to the series as a whole. The producers were able to incorporate many actors from earlier in the series, with others who could not appear because of scheduling conflicts still represented.<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWOct2016\" /> At the end of ''The Flash'' episode, Oliver, Thea, Sara, Diggle, and Ray are captured by the Dominators and held in stasis with their minds experiencing a \"shared hallucination\"; this allowed the writers \"to revisit footage from the previous 99 episodes\" in the characters' memory flashes.<ref name=\"Arrow100Footage\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe three episodes were filmed from September 23 to October 12, 2016.<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /><ref name=\"LoTProduction\" /> They were filmed concurrently, with some cast members shooting scenes for several series each day.

Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] facility where the heroes initially meet was made to look like the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series. Stock footage of the building in Cincinnati that was used as the basis for the Hall of Justice, [[Cincinnati Union Terminal|Union Terminal]], was altered by Encore for the crossover.<ref name=\"Encore\" />\n\n[[Colin Donnell]] and [[Colton Haynes]] appear as holograms, reprising their roles as [[Tommy Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Tommy Merlyn]] and [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]], at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. They appeared as holograms (not physically) due to other commitments which prevented their being re-shot. Guggenheim said that Zoic Studios had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] them from older episodes noting \"It was hard, obviously because they had to work with preexisting footage. Yes, they had [many] episodes to choose from, but it was a lot harder than that makes it sound.\"<ref name=\"TommyRoyHolograms\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Invasion home media.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=Home media cover art|Home media cover art for \"Invasion!\"]]\nDespite \"Invasion!\" only occurring on three of the four CW series, the event, marketed as \"Heroes v Aliens\", was called a \"four-night crossover event\" beginning with the ''Supergirl'' episode.<ref name=\"Trailer\" /> In Canada, where ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'' and ''Legends'' air on [[CTV Television Network]], the crossover was marketed as a three-night event entitled \"Heroes United\".<ref name=\"CanadaCTV\" /> A faux [[Classified information in the United States|classified U.S. government video]] was released, set about 70 years in the past, detailing the Dominators' first attempt to conquer Earth.<ref name=\"DominatorsVideo\" /> The crossover's trailer was released on November 23, 2016.<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nAfter beginning in the final scene of the November 28, 2016, episode of ''Supergirl'', the first part on ''The Flash'' aired on November 29, followed by part two on ''Arrow'' on November 30, and concluding with part three on ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on December 1, all on The CW.<ref name=\"EWCoverNov2016\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe episodes, the rest of ''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s second season, ''The Flash''{{'}}s third season and ''Arrow''{{'}}s fifth season were released separately on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] on August 15, 2017,<ref name=\"HomeMedia-LoTS2\" /> September 5<ref name=\"HomeMedia-FlashS3\" /> and September 19, respectively.<ref name=\"HomeMedia-ArrowS5\" /> The three episodes, accompanied by three \"Allied: The Invasion Complex\" behind-the-scenes featurettes (included separately in each series' home media release), were released together on a separate DVD on August 17, 2017 in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]<ref name=\"InvasionDVD-UK\" /> and September 20 in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]].<ref name=\"InvasionDVD-AU\" /> The episodes are available for streaming on [[Netflix]] and The CW app in the United States.<ref name=\"Netflix\" /><ref name=\"CWApp\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Ratings===\n{{Television episode ratings\n| width       = 99\n| show_series = y\n\n| series1     = The Flash\n| date1       = November 29, 2016\n| rs1         = 1.5/5\n| viewers1    = 4.15<ref name=\"FlashLive\" />\n| dvr1        = 0.9\n| dvrv1       = 2.17\n| total1      = 2.4\n| totalv1     = 6.31<ref name=\"DVR\" />\n\n| series2     = Arrow\n| date2       = November 30, 2016\n| rs2         = 1.3/5\n| viewers2    = 3.55<ref name=\"ArrowLive\" />\n| dvr2        = 0.7\n| dvrv2       = 1.80\n| total2      = 2.0\n| totalv2     = 5.34<ref name=\"DVR\" />\n\n| series3     = Legends of Tomorrow\n| date3       = December 1, 2016\n| rs3         = 1.2/4\n| viewers3    = 3.39<ref name=\"LegendsLive\" />\n| dvr3        = 0.7\n| dvrv3       = 1.84\n| total3      = 1.9\n| totalv3     = 5.24<ref name=\"DVR\" />\n}}\n\n\"Invasion!\" gave the CW its most-watched week in six years.<ref name=\"DeadlineWeekRatings\" /> ''The Flash'' episode had a season-three-high viewership (the series' largest since December 9, 2014) and a season-three-high 18\u201349 rating, the highest since February 16, 2016.

There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future.\"<ref name=\"LegendsAVClub\" /> According to Ed Gross of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' felt \"Invasion!\" was a \"proverbial mixed bag\". He felt \"Invasion!\" did an effective job of bringing the characters from each series together since \"the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny\". Gross took issue to how the crossover was promoted as \"a massive adventure\" when it turned out to be \"rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative\u2014it would have been better to get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat ... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected.\" Gross gave the crossover four out of five stars.<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Allison Keene enjoyed the interaction of the cast members between the four shows, with ''The Flash'' setting the tone of the crossover, with the others incorporating \"its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing\". However, the crossovers also have the ability to \"starkly highlight each show's weaknesses.\" Keene concluded, \"There are things \"Invasion!\" as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans\".<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 10 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The CW marshals its lovable roster of superheroes all together to quell an ''Invasion!'' in a sprawling crossover event that makes great use of each series headliners' charms.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s03/e08 |title=The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Season 3 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave ''The Flash'' episode an 8.4 out of 10, noting the appeal of seeing many of the Arrowverse characters joining forces. He was critical of the Dominators, feeling they were not \"well-defined... to unify these heroes\", resulting in the Flashpoint-related character drama to propel the first act. Schedeen continued, \"Everyone had their moment to shine, even more minor players like Felicity and Thea. But if there was one subplot that felt unnecessary and out of place, it was Wally's\", calling it \"forced\". Schedeen appreciated the focus on the fallout from Flashpoint, calling it \"one of the biggest flaws of Season 3 so far\" on ''The Flash'', and hoped that more of the Dominators' comic backstory would appear in the crossover's other two episodes.<ref name=\"FlashIGN\" /> ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak gave the episode a B+, calling the episode an \"absurdly overstuff kickoff\" to \"Invasion!\" He enjoyed that the episode \"continues to advance the story arcs of this season of ''The Flash'' and finds a way to weave those ongoing conflicts into the multi-series story of an alien invasion.\" Von Doviak questioned some of the episode's events, such as Barry's knowledge of the Legends adventures and his not caring about secret identities, and said that viewers \"who don't necessarily follow the other three shows religiously are at a disadvantage\".<ref name=\"FlashAVClub\" />\n\nOn Collider.com, Carla Day gave ''The Flash'' episode five out of five stars and called it \"brilliant\", saying, \"With so many characters on the scene, it would have been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose ''The Flash''{{'}}s unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor.\" Day's only complaint was about the Dominators' unclear motivations.<ref name=\"FlashCollider\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Chancellor Agard gave ''The Flash'' episode an A\u2212, feeling \"Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet... This is really the first time Berlanti and Co. can tell a cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off.\" Agard felt the focus on the Team Flash drama made the episode \"drag a bit\" and, like Schedeen, his \"biggest problems were with the Wally stuff\" but conceded it was included \"for viewers who might only watch ''The Flash'', and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans.\"<ref name=\"FlashEW\" />\n\n====''Arrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating, based on 7 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s05/e08 |title=Arrow&nbsp;\u2013 Season 5 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave ''Arrow''{{'}}s episode an 8.7 out of 10, saying \"This ''Arrow'' episode worked much better as a 100th episode celebration than it did the middle act of the \"Invasion\" crossover,\" calling the shared hallucination premise \"an emotionally rich and action-packed way to celebrate the show's first 100 episodes.\" Schedeen was critical of the Cisco and Team Arrow subplot that \"did little to advance the larger narrative\", as well as the overall pacing of the crossover up to this point.<ref name=\"ArrowIGN\" /> Alasdair Wilkins of ''The A.V. Club'' gave ''Arrow'' an A, stating that while \"Invasion!\" could have been \"an unholy mess\" trying to fit ''Arrow''{{'}}s 100th episode celebration in the middle of the crossover, by focusing on ''Arrow''{{'}}s past and including former cast members \"ends up giving the show a way to develop the power and the threat of the Dominators without this crossover just being three straight episodes of heroes and aliens punching each other.\" Wilkins concluded, \"If this is how ''Arrow'' marks 100 episodes, then here's to 100 more. If this isn't the best episode in ''Arrow''{{'}}s history, it's damn close.\"<ref name=\"ArrowAVClub\" />\n\nCollider.com's Kayti Burt said that the ''Arrow'' episode \"gets enough nostalgic hits in to make it work, while also giving us an exciting (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover.\" Burt felt the shared hallucination \"works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people.\" Burt \"was a bit sad\" that the series would not have the opportunity to have a 100th episode outside the crossover, with the demands of moving the crossover \"sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do ... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways\". She gave the episode three out of five stars.<ref name=\"ArrowCollider\" /> Sara Netzley of ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode an A, saying, \"We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the \"Invasion\" story line\u2014and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made ''Arrow'' such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off.\"<ref name=\"ArrowEW\" />\n\n====''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 9 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Arrowverse gang is back together. What more could you want?\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s02/e07 |title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow&nbsp;\u2013 Season 2 Episode 7 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRating the episode an 8.8 out of 10, Schedeen said the crossover \"ended on a strong note. This episode delivered the most on the promise of superheroes joining forces to battle alien invaders. And even if there were a few points of frustration (mainly involving a lack of Supergirl early on), it made the most of the premise and delivered a rousing final battle.\" He enjoyed the final back story of the Dominators, which gave them clearer motivations so they no longer felt like \"a completely faceless, generic alien threat\", and Cisco's creation of a device for Supergirl to travel between universes, which would allow for more frequent crossovers between the characters.<ref name=\"LegendsIGN\" /> Sava graded the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode A-, feeling it did not have the same \"emotional punch\" of ''Arrow''{{'}}s episode, but was still \"a strong conclusion that has the good guys saving the day and learning more about themselves in the process.\" He called the final battle \"anticlimactic\", noting it would have been more satisfying if there was a \"more creative use of all the different powers in this group working together, and... a stronger sense of collaboration among the human/metahuman fighters.\"<ref name=\"LegendsAVClub\" />\n\n''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Shirley Li gave the episode a B+, as \"it didn't feel at all like a ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, despite all the quips from Mick and the blue chyron and the time traveling\"; she said that it was more like a second ''Flash'' episode. Li also added that the \"budgetary constraints were glaring\", and gave as examples Thea's failure to appear in the episode and Kara's absence from the confrontation with the elderly glasses-wearing official after Oliver lashed out at her. Despite this, Li felt much of the episode worked, with each character getting a chance to shine \"and though the Dominators' motive [was] still somewhat muddled, the invasion sparked fun rapport among the teams... This might not drive any non-''Legends'' viewers to watch ''Legends'', but the episode gave plenty to Arrowverse fans.\"<ref name=\"LegendsEW\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n[[Comic Book Resources]] ranked

Events at the end of the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode \"[[Medusa (Supergirl)|Medusa]]\" on November 28, 2016, marked the beginning of the crossover, which began on November 29 with ''The Flash'', continued on ''Arrow'' on November 30, and concluded on ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on December 1. Each of the main three episodes were titled \"Invasion!\". In the crossover, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] recruits [[Kara Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers / Supergirl]] from Earth-38 to Earth-1 to help his team, [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and his team, and the [[Legends of Tomorrow (team)|Legends]] to defeat the alien race known as the [[Dominators (Arrowverse)|Dominators]].\n\nDevelopment of a crossover between the three series and ''Supergirl'' began in May 2016, when it was learned that ''Supergirl'' would move to The CW from [[CBS]] for its second season. By the following September the scripts for each episode were written, and were filmed in October 2016. The premise and episode titles were also announced in September. In \"Invasion!\", the main cast members of each series appear in (at least) their own series; [[Melissa Benoist]] appears as Supergirl in the entire crossover. A number of actors and characters from previous ''Arrow'' seasons returned to reprise their roles, since ''Arrow''{{'}}s episode doubled as its [[100 episodes|100th]].\n\nThe three episodes of the crossover received positive reviews, with critics praising the interaction among the actors in each series and each episode's advancing season storylines as part of the crossover. The Dominators storyline was regarded as its weakest link, with reviewers finding the alien race's motivations unclear. Ratings for the episodes were high, with each breaking records in viewership and the 18\u201349 rating and contributing to the most-watched week on The CW in six years. A fourth crossover, \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\", occurred the following year.<ref name=\"Crisis\" />\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] investigates a meteor crash outside [[Central City (Arrowverse)|Central City]] which is a spaceship from which aliens emerge. [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] tells the team that the [[Dominators (Arrowverse)|Dominators]] had landed during the 1950s, but mysteriously departed. Barry assembles the original members of Team Arrow, [[Thea Queen]], the [[Legends (superhero team)|Legends]], and [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers]], Supergirl of Earth-38. The team begins training at a [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] facility, sparring with Supergirl to prepare for the aliens. Kara struggles to earn [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]]'s trust. [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] finds and reveals a message Barry's future self sent to [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]], which exposes Barry's manipulation of the timeline and its effect on other team members. As a result, only Oliver, Kara, [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]], [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson \"Jax\" Jackson]], and [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] still trust Barry.\n\nAfter the Dominators abduct the President of the United States, the team goes to rescue him; however, Barry remains behind since most of them distrust him with Oliver staying behind in support of Barry. Kara leads the group, but the Dominators kill the President and activate a [[mind control]] device to take over the group. The controlled heroes return and attack S.T.A.R. Labs, where Barry and Oliver confront them. While Oliver holds them off, Barry lures Kara to the device and manipulates her into destroying it, freeing everyone from the Dominators' control. When the team regroups, [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] tells Barry that everyone forgives and trusts him. [[Sara Lance]], Ray, [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]], Thea, and Oliver are then abducted by the Dominators.\n\nThey are held in pods on a Dominators' ship, each one unconscious except for a shared [[hallucination]] of [[simulated reality]]. In the hallucination, Oliver is living at Queen Manor, [[Pilot (Arrow)#Plot|having never gotten on the ''Queen's Gambit'']], and is about to be married to [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]]. His parents are alive, and Diggle is operating as the vigilante the Hood, instead of Oliver. The captives begin seeing flashes of their real lives, and realize what the Dominators have done to them. Their escape attempt is blocked by personifications of their enemies: [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Deathstroke]] and two of his Mirakuru soldiers (who killed Ray's fianc\u00e9e Anna Loring), and [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]] and two of his [[H.I.V.E. (Arrowverse)|H.I.V.E.]] soldiers. The adversaries are defeated, and the five awaken in the Dominators' ship and escape in a shuttle. Felicity, [[Curtis Holt (Arrowverse)|Curtis Holt]], and Cisco try to hack into the Dominators' mainframe. Aided by Barry and Kara, they recover a device to locate the captives, who are rescued by [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood]] in the time ship, ''Waverider''. Aboard the ''Waverider'', Ray deduces that the Dominators were gathering information about [[metahumans]], using the hallucination as a distraction, to help them build a special \"weapon\". Meanwhile, the Dominator [[mothership]] heads towards Earth.\n\nNate says that the first Dominator invasion occurred in 1951 in [[Redmond, Oregon]]. He goes there with fellow Legends [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] and [[Amaya Jiwe]] and Felicity and Cisco to kidnap a Dominator for information. Although they are successful, the three Legends and their alien captive are taken prisoner by [[National Security Agency|N.S.A. agents]]. The Legends learn from the Dominator that the aliens have arrived to assess humanity's threat, now that metahumans have appeared and formed the [[Justice Society of America]]. Felicity and Cisco rescue the Legends, and also set the Dominator free, carelessly altering history. In 2016 Central City, the team learns that the Dominators know about Barry's manipulation of the timeline, deem him a threat, and are demanding his surrender in exchange for peace. After the Legends return, the team discovers that the Dominators' weapon is a bomb that will kill all metahumans on Earth, with millions of collateral human casualties. The teams dissuade Barry from surrendering, and he and Cisco reconcile. The team manage to destroy the bomb and force the Dominators to retreat with a pain-inflicting [[nanotechnology|nano-weapon]]. As the heroes celebrate their victory, Oliver offers Kara his friendship; Cisco gives her a device which will enable her to interdimensional travel and communicate between Earth-1 and Earth-38. Martin persuades Jax not to tell the others that his daughter Lily's existence is the result of a [[temporal paradox]] he inadvertently caused when the Legends were in 1987.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{further2|[[List of The Flash characters|The Flash]], [[List of Arrow characters|Arrow]], and [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters|Legends of Tomorrow]] cast and characters}}\n\n===Main and recurring===\n<!--Ordered per WP:TVCAST.

He added that it would have been logistically difficult to incorporate the four series, noting that finding the time for [[Melissa Benoist]] to shoot material for the other three series was complicated. Benoist did not appear in much of \"[[The Darkest Place]]\", the episode before \"Medusa\", to make her available to appear in each of the crossover episodes.<ref name=\"KreisbergIGN\" /> He expanded on the difficulties, saying that \"built-in shut-down days\" for ''Supergirl'' were not planned on, in part because the series switched from CBS to The CW, and that this inability to shut down normal production prevented it from having a larger role in the crossover.<ref name=\"EWFeb2017\" />\n\nIt was announced the following September that the villains in the event would be the [[Dominators (Arrowverse)|Dominators]], in a story inspired by the 1989 comic miniseries ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]''<ref name=\"DominatorsReveal\" /> The Dominators were chosen because the writers \"collectively wanted the superheroes to face an external threat,\" meaning \"a threat that came from outside of the shows\", rather than extraterrestrial.<ref name=\"DominatorsReason\" /> The following month, ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' creator and executive producer [[Marc Guggenheim]] said that the title of each episode of the crossover would be \"Invasion!\".<ref name=\"InvasionTitle\" />\n\nIn November 2016, Kreisberg said that the Dominators would appear during the later part of ''Supergirl''{{'}}s season after the crossover event.<ref name=\"DominatorsSupergirl\" /> Guggenheim said that in the initial script for ''The Flash'', [[Lynda Carter]] appeared as the Vice President (becoming President after his death in the episode); Carter appears as President Olivia Marsdin on ''Supergirl''. This did not occur because a note from the studio felt it would have been too confusing, having Marsdin appear as president on one series (and another Earth) and vice president on the others. Guggenheim added, \"In the midst of time travel and aliens, it was just one sci-fi problem too much\" and conceded that \"if people at the studio were confused by the script, it was probably not particularly friendly to casual fans.\"<ref name=\"LyndaCarter\" />\n\n===Writing===\nScripts for \"Invasion!\" were written in mid-September 2016, with Berlanti creating the story for the event and Kreisberg helping to craft the story of ''The Flash'' episode.<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /><ref name=\"LoTProduction\" /><ref name=\"FlashProduction\" /> The teleplay for ''The Flash'' was written by [[showrunners]] [[Aaron and Todd Helbing]];<ref name=\"FlashProduction\" /> ''Arrow''{{'}}s was written by showrunners Guggenheim and [[Wendy Mericle]],<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /> and showrunners [[Phil Klemmer]] and Guggenheim wrote the teleplay for ''Legends of Tomorrow''.<ref name=\"LoTProduction\" /> When the Dominators were chosen as the threat for the crossover, the writers were able to justify the heroes' uniting; since Supergirl \"is knowledgeable about these particular enemies, the Legends can help better understand the last time the Dominators visited Earth thanks to their time travel capabilities, and both Teams Flash and Arrow have a diverse array of capable heroes who are able to understand and counter just about every imaginable threat.\"<ref name=\"DominatorsReason\" />\n\n''Arrow''{{'}}s episode in the crossover was also the series' 100th. Guggenheim said that Berlanti's idea for the episode \"allow[ed] us to have our cake and eat it too\" in respecting ''Arrow'' as a whole and incorporating it into the crossover, with Guggenheim calling it \"a love letter\" to the series as a whole. The producers were able to incorporate many actors from earlier in the series, with others who could not appear because of scheduling conflicts still represented.<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWOct2016\" /> At the end of ''The Flash'' episode, Oliver, Thea, Sara, Diggle, and Ray are captured by the Dominators and held in stasis with their minds experiencing a \"shared hallucination\"; this allowed the writers \"to revisit footage from the previous 99 episodes\" in the characters' memory flashes.<ref name=\"Arrow100Footage\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe three episodes were filmed from September 23 to October 12, 2016.<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /><ref name=\"LoTProduction\" /> They were filmed concurrently, with some cast members shooting scenes for several series each day. Filming was done at the [[Boundary Bay Airport]].<ref name=\"AirportFilming\" /> ''The Flash''{{'}}s episode was directed by [[Dermott Downs]],<ref name=\"EWCoverNov2016\" /><ref name=\"FlashProduction\" /> ''Arrow''{{'}}s by [[James Bamford (stunt coordinator)|James Bamford]],<ref name=\"ArrowProduction\" /> and ''Legend of Tomorrow''{{'}}s by [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]].<ref name=\"LoTProduction\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe crossover's visual effects were by Encore Post and [[Zoic Studios]].<ref name=\"Encore\" /><ref name=\"TommyRoyHolograms\" /> The Dominators were created with \"cutting-edge prosthetics and computer effects ... to achieve a feature film-quality look which is faithful to ''Invasion!'' artist [[Todd McFarlane]]'s interpretation of the characters.\"<ref name=\"DominatorsReveal\" /> Although they originally wore the green robes of the comics, Guggenheim said that when it was decided to create the species in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], the robes \"made animating them prohibitively impossible\".<ref name=\"ProducersDominators\" />\n\nThe [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] facility where the heroes initially meet was made to look like the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series. Stock footage of the building in Cincinnati that was used as the basis for the Hall of Justice, [[Cincinnati Union Terminal|Union Terminal]], was altered by Encore for the crossover.<ref name=\"Encore\" />\n\n[[Colin Donnell]] and [[Colton Haynes]] appear as holograms, reprising their roles as [[Tommy Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Tommy Merlyn]] and [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]], at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode.

Club]]'' said that the episodes did \"admirable work advancing the overarching narrative while maintaining each show's distinct perspective\" along with being \"a hell of a lot of fun, and it's significantly expanded the scope of the Arrowverse by bringing in an extraterrestrial enemy ... There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future.\"<ref name=\"LegendsAVClub\" /> According to Ed Gross of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' felt \"Invasion!\" was a \"proverbial mixed bag\". He felt \"Invasion!\" did an effective job of bringing the characters from each series together since \"the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny\". Gross took issue to how the crossover was promoted as \"a massive adventure\" when it turned out to be \"rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative\u2014it would have been better to get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat ... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected.\" Gross gave the crossover four out of five stars.<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Allison Keene enjoyed the interaction of the cast members between the four shows, with ''The Flash'' setting the tone of the crossover, with the others incorporating \"its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing\". However, the crossovers also have the ability to \"starkly highlight each show's weaknesses.\" Keene concluded, \"There are things \"Invasion!\" as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans\".<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100% approval rating, based on 10 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The CW marshals its lovable roster of superheroes all together to quell an ''Invasion!'' in a sprawling crossover event that makes great use of each series headliners' charms.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s03/e08 |title=The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Season 3 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave ''The Flash'' episode an 8.4 out of 10, noting the appeal of seeing many of the Arrowverse characters joining forces. He was critical of the Dominators, feeling they were not \"well-defined... to unify these heroes\", resulting in the Flashpoint-related character drama to propel the first act. Schedeen continued, \"Everyone had their moment to shine, even more minor players like Felicity and Thea. But if there was one subplot that felt unnecessary and out of place, it was Wally's\", calling it \"forced\". Schedeen appreciated the focus on the fallout from Flashpoint, calling it \"one of the biggest flaws of Season 3 so far\" on ''The Flash'', and hoped that more of the Dominators' comic backstory would appear in the crossover's other two episodes.<ref name=\"FlashIGN\" /> ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak gave the episode a B+, calling the episode an \"absurdly overstuff kickoff\" to \"Invasion!\" He enjoyed that the episode \"continues to advance the story arcs of this season of ''The Flash'' and finds a way to weave those ongoing conflicts into the multi-series story of an alien invasion.\" Von Doviak questioned some of the episode's events, such as Barry's knowledge of the Legends adventures and his not caring about secret identities, and said that viewers \"who don't necessarily follow the other three shows religiously are at a disadvantage\".<ref name=\"FlashAVClub\" />\n\nOn Collider.com, Carla Day gave ''The Flash'' episode five out of five stars and called it \"brilliant\", saying, \"With so many characters on the scene, it would have been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose ''The Flash''{{'}}s unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor.\" Day's only complaint was about the Dominators' unclear motivations.<ref name=\"FlashCollider\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Chancellor Agard gave ''The Flash'' episode an A\u2212, feeling \"Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet... This is really the first time Berlanti and Co. can tell a cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off.\" Agard felt the focus on the Team Flash drama made the episode \"drag a bit\" and, like Schedeen, his \"biggest problems were with the Wally stuff\" but conceded it was included \"for viewers who might only watch ''The Flash'', and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans.\"<ref name=\"FlashEW\" />\n\n====''Arrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating, based on 7 reviews for the episode.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s05/e08 |title=Arrow&nbsp;\u2013 Season 5 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave ''Arrow''{{'}}s episode an 8.7 out of 10, saying \"This ''Arrow'' episode worked much better as a 100th episode celebration than it did the middle act of the \"Invasion\" crossover,\" calling the shared hallucination premise \"an emotionally rich and action-packed way to celebrate the show's first 100 episodes.\" Schedeen was critical of the Cisco and Team Arrow subplot that \"did little to advance the larger narrative\", as well as the overall pacing of the crossover up to this point.<ref name=\"ArrowIGN\" /> Alasdair Wilkins of ''The A.V. Club'' gave ''Arrow'' an A, stating that while \"Invasion!\" could have been \"an unholy mess\" trying to fit ''Arrow''{{'}}s 100th episode celebration in the middle of the crossover, by focusing on ''Arrow''{{'}}s past and including former cast members \"ends up giving the show a way to develop the power and the threat of the Dominators without this crossover just being three straight episodes of heroes and aliens punching each other.\" Wilkins concluded, \"If this is how ''Arrow'' marks 100 episodes, then here's to 100 more. If this isn't the best episode in ''Arrow''{{'}}s history, it's damn close.\"<ref name=\"ArrowAVClub\" />\n\nCollider.com's Kayti Burt said that the ''Arrow'' episode \"gets enough nostalgic hits in to make it work, while also giving us an exciting (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover.\" Burt felt the shared hallucination \"works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people.\" Burt \"was a bit sad\" that the series would not have the opportunity to have a 100th episode outside the crossover, with the demands of moving the crossover \"sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do ... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways\". She gave the episode three out of five stars.<ref name=\"ArrowCollider\" /> Sara Netzley of ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode an A, saying, \"We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the \"Invasion\" story line\u2014and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made ''Arrow'' such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off.\"<ref name=\"ArrowEW\" />\n\n====''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 9 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Arrowverse gang is back together. What more could you want?\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s02/e07 |title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow&nbsp;\u2013 Season 2 Episode 7 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRating the episode an 8.8 out of 10, Schedeen said the crossover \"ended on a strong note. This episode delivered the most on the promise of superheroes joining forces to battle alien invaders. And even if there were a few points of frustration (mainly involving a lack of Supergirl early on), it made the most of the premise and delivered a rousing final battle.\" He enjoyed the final back story of the Dominators, which gave them clearer motivations so they no longer felt like \"a completely faceless, generic alien threat\", and Cisco's creation of a device for Supergirl to travel between universes, which would allow for more frequent crossovers between the characters.<ref name=\"LegendsIGN\" /> Sava graded the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode A-, feeling it did not have the same \"emotional punch\" of ''Arrow''{{'}}s episode, but was still \"a strong conclusion that has the good guys saving the day and learning more about themselves in the process.\" He called the final battle \"anticlimactic\", noting it would have been more satisfying if there was a \"more creative use of all the different powers in this group working together, and... a stronger sense of collaboration among the human/metahuman fighters.\"<ref name=\"LegendsAVClub\" />\n\n''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Shirley Li gave the episode a B+, as \"it didn't feel at all like a ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, despite all the quips from Mick and the blue chyron and the time traveling\"; she said that it was more like a second ''Flash'' episode. Li also added that the \"budgetary constraints were glaring\", and gave as examples Thea's failure to appear in the episode and Kara's absence from the confrontation with the elderly glasses-wearing official after Oliver lashed out at her. Despite this, Li felt much of the episode worked, with each character getting a chance to shine \"and though the Dominators' motive [was] still somewhat muddled, the invasion sparked fun rapport among the teams... This might not drive any non-''Legends'' viewers to watch ''Legends'', but the episode gave plenty to Arrowverse fans.\"<ref name=\"LegendsEW\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n[[Comic Book Resources]] ranked

The work may be difficult, dangerous, climatically challenging or underpaid. Workers in sweatshops may work long hours with low pay, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a [[minimum wage]]; [[child labor]] laws may also be violated. The Fair Labor Association's \"2006 Annual Public Report\" inspected factories for FLA compliance in 18 countries including Bangladesh, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, China, India, Vietnam, Honduras, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2006_annual_public_report.pdf |title=2006 Annual Public Report |publisher=fairlabor.org |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref> The U.S. Department of Labor's \"2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor\" found that \"18 countries did not meet the [[International Labour Organization]]'s recommendation for an adequate number of inspectors.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/2015TDA_1.pdf |title=2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor |publisher=dol.gov |accessdate=August 28, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sweatshop in Ludlow Street Tenement, New York cph.3a24271.jpg |thumb|right|A sweatshop in a New York tenement building, c. 1889]]\n\nA sweatshop is a factory or workshop, especially in the [[clothing industry]], where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours under poor conditions and many health risks.\n\nMany workplaces through history have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; but the concept of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the ''sweater'', directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses. Second view of the Western Dress Factory. Emphasis on general conditions in the... - NARA - 518630.jpg|thumb|[[Lewis Hine]] noted poor working conditions when he photographed workers at the Western Dress Factory in [[Millville, New Jersey]], for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s National Research Project (1937)]]\n\nIn 1911, negative public perceptions of sweatshops were galvanized by the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in New York City. The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught \"failing to protect its workers\" in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463|title=Apple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers' |website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/leading-article-the-gruesome-reality-of-sweatshops-2094318.html|title=Leading Article: The Gruesome Reality of Sweatshops |work=Independent.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Workers then go into a state of forced labor, if even one day of work is not accounted for, most are immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past. Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Contemporary use of the term==\n\n[[File:Lindintracuay.jpg|thumb|right|A modern-day sweatshop]]\nThe phrase sweatshop was coined in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working long hours and in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Contributing factors==\n\n===Fast fashion===\n{{main|Fast fashion}}\nA trend called \"fast fashion\" has contributed to the rise of sweatshops. Fast fashion refers to \"rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time\" (Ross, 2015)<ref>Ross, R. J. S. (2015). The high toll of fast fashion. Dissent. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from Dissent, web site :https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-true-cost-review-fastfashion-rana-plaza-accord{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}.</ref> To catch up with the fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers\u2019 demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour.

Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\n{{main|Anti-sweatshop movement}}\n\n===History===\n====19th and early 20th centuries====\n\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Late 20th century to present====\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective.

Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Contributing factors==\n\n===Fast fashion===\n{{main|Fast fashion}}\nA trend called \"fast fashion\" has contributed to the rise of sweatshops. Fast fashion refers to \"rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time\" (Ross, 2015)<ref>Ross, R. J. S. (2015). The high toll of fast fashion. Dissent. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from Dissent, web site :https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-true-cost-review-fastfashion-rana-plaza-accord{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}.</ref> To catch up with the fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers\u2019 demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

For example, labour camps in Dubai, UAE do not have proper conditions for the workers and if they protest they can be deported if they are foreigners.<ref>https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/how-did-new-york-university-uphold-workers-rights-during-construction-of-abu-dhabi-satellite-campus</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch</ref>\n\n===Low education level===\nIt is suggested that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet a lot of them in developing countries are ignorant about their own right because of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\n{{main|Anti-sweatshop movement}}\n\n===History===\n====Early period (19th and early 20th centuries)====\n\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Late 20th century to present====\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle. This separation of production from consumption is an intentional move by corporations precisely to avoid being held responsible by consumers for their actions.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

In Nepal, a carpet manufacturing company closed several sweatshops, resulting in thousands of Nepalese girls turning to prostitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |title=Third World Workers Need Western Jobs |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=May 6, 2004 |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816030549/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |archive-date=August 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nA 1996 study of corporate codes of conduct in the apparel industry by the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that corporate codes of conduct that monitor labor norms in the apparel industry, rather than boycott or eliminate contracts upon the discovery of violations of internationally recognized labor norms, are a more effective way to eliminate child labor and the exploitation of children, provided they provide for effective monitoring that includes the participation of workers and their knowledge of the standards to which their employers are subject.<ref>{{citation |title=The Apparel Industry and Codes of Conduct: A Solution to the International Child Labor Problem? |author=U.S. Department of Labor |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202211838/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nArguably, the United States underwent a similar process during its own industrialization where child labor and the suppression of worker organizations were prevalent.  According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

Liu is the founder of [[Lenovo]], one of the largest computer makers in the world. He remains one of the leaders of the company. And is daughter jiao is also chair person of Lenovo\n\n==Business activities==\n\n===Lenovo===\n{{main | Lenovo}}\nBy the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, \"We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away.\" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu founded [[Lenovo]] (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in [[Beijing]] with 200,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]] and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, \"It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours.\"<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, \"We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making.\" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLenovo's founders, all scientists and engineers, faced difficulty from their lack of familiarity with market-oriented business practices, traditional Chinese ambivalence towards commerce, and anti-capitalist communist ideology. During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to [[Zhongguancun]], where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process [[Chinese characters]]. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\n[[Lenovo]] also tried and failed to market a [[digital watch]]. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi, received government permission to open a subsidiary in [[Hong Kong]] and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in [[Hong Kong]], supported his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in [[Hong Kong]] in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about [[Lenovo]]'s profitability.[[ Lenovo]]'s IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nWhen [[Lenovo]] was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration for [[Lenovo]]. In an interview with [[The Economist]] he said, \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, [[Lenovo]] served as Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\"/> Speaking about Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\nLenovo's later takeover of IBM's personal computing business made him the first Chinese CEO to lead the takeover of a major American firm.<ref name=\"SILU\">{{cite web |url=https://www.silu.com/articles/354-ceo-profile-liu-chuanzhi-founder-of-lenovo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701190345/https://www.silu.com/articles/354-ceo-profile-liu-chuanzhi-founder-of-lenovo |archivedate=1 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During an interview, Liu acknowledged the major risks involved with the IBM deal. \"We had three serious risks. Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"<ref name=\"SILU\"/>\n\n[[Business ethics]] were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent lots of time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Legend in the making\n|author= |url= |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001}}</ref>\n\n===Legend Holdings===\n{{main | Legend Holdings}}\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016.  Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and [[Hony Capital]].<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite news |title=Lenovo founder steps down as president |author=Andrew Nusca |url= http://www.zdnet.com/lenovo-founder-steps-down-as-president-1339339909/|newspaper=ZDNet |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Forbes1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2011/1205/companies-people-liu-chuanzhi-lenovo-computer-ipo-flannery.html|title=Liu Chuanzhi Has Legend Holdings In His Sights|first=Russell|last=Flannery|date=23 November 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with the [[British Broadcasting Company|BBC]], Liu said that his vision for Legend was for it \"to become an industry in its own right\" and that he wants it \"to be become the top enterprise across industries...not only in China, but in the whole world.\" Liu said that he realized that his vision was extremely ambitious and may have to be left to his successors to implement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20393351|title=CEO Guru: Dreams and ambitions|first=Neil|last=Koenig|date=20 November 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nLiu said in an interview with ''Forbes'' that he hoped to diversify away from IT-related businesses and that Legend Holding's assets would be mainly concentrated in information technology, real estate, services,  coal processing, and agriculture. He said agriculture  \"will become the next strategic development area for Legend Holdings.\" Liu said agriculture is just one part of what he sees as \"huge\" opportunities in sectors that cater to Chinese consumers. In the same interview, Liu said that Legend's focus would continue to remain on China. \"Whatever we do has to fit into something we are doing in China,\" said Liu when referring to plans for overseas investment.<ref name=\"Forbes1\"/> Liu said in July 2012 that he plans to take Legend Holdings public with a listing in Hong Kong.

The offering received regulatory approval in June of that year. Liu said in an interview that he planned to float Legend's stock on a domestic Chinese exchange before his retirement.<ref name=\"IPO2\">{{cite news |last=Salvacion |first=Manny |date=8 June 2015 |title=Legend Holding\u2019s $2B IPO Approved, Investor Listing to Begin |url=http://en.yibada.com/articles/37244/20150608/legend-holding-s-2b-ipo-approved-investor-listing-begin.htm |newspaper=Yibada |location=China |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Joyvio===\nJoyvio is Legend Holdings' vehicle for investment in the food industry.

In November 2013, its product range was expanded to kiwifruit. The kiwifruit has been named \"Liu Kiwi,\" in honor of Liu Chuanzhi. Liu is responsible for Legend's move into food. Since 2011, Joyvio has acquired farms around the world including blueberry fields in [[Shandong]] and [[Chile]] and kiwifruit plantations in Sichuan, [[Shaanxi]], [[Henan]], and [[Chile]]. The firm had plans to start selling cherries and grapes from the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and Chile by the end of 2013.<ref name=\"Joy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1358932/legend-applies-its-tech-know-how-fruit|title=Legend applies its tech know-how to fruit|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nJoyvio took advantage of Legend's experience in information technology to set up a tracking system to ensure the quality and safety of its products.

He also served as the CEO of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]].<ref name=\"BWPRO\"/>\n\n==Education and early career==\nAfter graduating from high school in 1962, Liu applied to be a military pilot and passed all the associated exams. Despite his father's revolutionary credentials, Liu was declared unfit for military service because a relative had been denounced as a rightist. In autumn of the same year, Liu entered the People's Liberation Army Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, now known as [[Xidian University]]. Due to his political and class background, Liu was deemed unsuitable for such sensitive subjects and assigned to study radar. During his studies Liu received an introduction to computing.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu was labeled an \"intellectual element\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In 1966, he told his classmates that the revolution was a terrible idea and was sent to a state-owned rice farm near [[Macau]] in [[Guangdong]] as a result. From there he was sent to a farm in [[Hunan]] dedicated to reform through hard labor. Liu returned to Beijing where he took up a post in 1970 as an engineer-administrator at the Computer Institute that had earlier developed the Number 104, Number 109, and Number 111 mainframe computers. Liu worked on the development of the Number 757 mainframe computer. In 1984, he resigned to become a cadre in the personnel office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.<ref name=\"Book1\"/> He remained there until he co-founded Legend in 1984.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>\n\n==Political opinions==\nUnlike many other Chinese business leaders, Liu has often spoken out on political issues. Liu has criticized others' tendency for silence. He said, \"when it comes to the inappropriate actions the government takes, businessmen don't have the courage or capacity to go against them; second, they lack the social responsibility to care for the whole world and what they do is to 'mind their own business.'\"<ref name=\"SILU\"/>\n\nDuring an interview with ''Caijing'' in October 2012, he advocated for what he called \"elite selection\" of political leaders. He said, \"I\u2019m not sure how practical it would be to have universal voting in the near future. I hope the country's leaders could be elected by the elites of the society.\" Liu is also deeply concerned with the rule of law. He said, \"My biggest worry is an unlawful world. I tell my employees to be careful all the time; don't disrespect the government or bribe anyone -  even so, I'm still not at peace because there are always some corrupt individuals coming along to cause problems.\"<ref name=\"SILU\"/>\n\nIn December 2013 Liu expressed optimism about economic reform in China. He said, \"Now if the market is to play a central role and the government only plays the referee, only you will decide if you are going to win the race.\"<ref name=\"SCMP2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1394668/lenovos-founder-liu-chuanzhi-talks-politics-again|title=Lenovo's founder Liu Chuanzhi 'talks politics' again|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Public service and awards==\n\nAs of 2002, Liu served as vice-chairman of the [[All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce]].<ref>{{cite news |title=LIU CHUANZHI CLAIMS PRC ENTREPRENEURS YEARN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF 'THREE LINKS'\n |author=Wang Zhao |url= |newspaper=World News Connection |date=18 October 2002}}</ref> Since 2004, Liu has served as director of the Computer Technology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Liu is the founder of [[Lenovo]], one of the largest computer makers in the world. He remains one of the leaders of the company.\n\n==Business activities==\n\n===Lenovo===\n{{main | Lenovo}}\nBy the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, \"We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away.\" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu founded [[Lenovo]] (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in [[Beijing]] with 200,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]] and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, \"It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours.\"<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, \"We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making.\" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLenovo's founders, all scientists and engineers, faced difficulty from their lack of familiarity with market-oriented business practices, traditional Chinese ambivalence towards commerce, and anti-capitalist communist ideology. During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to [[Zhongguancun]], where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process [[Chinese characters]]. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\n[[Lenovo]] also tried and failed to market a [[digital watch]]. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi, received government permission to open a subsidiary in [[Hong Kong]] and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in [[Hong Kong]], supported his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in [[Hong Kong]] in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about [[Lenovo]]'s profitability.[[ Lenovo]]'s IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nWhen [[Lenovo]] was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration for [[Lenovo]]. In an interview with [[The Economist]] he said, \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, [[Lenovo]] served as Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\"/> Speaking about Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\nLenovo's later takeover of IBM's personal computing business made him the first Chinese CEO to lead the takeover of a major American firm.<ref name=\"SILU\">{{cite web |url=https://www.silu.com/articles/354-ceo-profile-liu-chuanzhi-founder-of-lenovo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701190345/https://www.silu.com/articles/354-ceo-profile-liu-chuanzhi-founder-of-lenovo |archivedate=1 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During an interview, Liu acknowledged the major risks involved with the IBM deal. \"We had three serious risks. Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"<ref name=\"SILU\"/>\n\n[[Business ethics]] were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent lots of time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Legend in the making\n|author= |url= |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001}}</ref>\n\n===Legend Holdings===\n{{main | Legend Holdings}}\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016.

He said agriculture  \"will become the next strategic development area for Legend Holdings.\" Liu said agriculture is just one part of what he sees as \"huge\" opportunities in sectors that cater to Chinese consumers. In the same interview, Liu said that Legend's focus would continue to remain on China. \"Whatever we do has to fit into something we are doing in China,\" said Liu when referring to plans for overseas investment.<ref name=\"Forbes1\"/> Liu said in July 2012 that he plans to take Legend Holdings public with a listing in Hong Kong.

He also served as the CEO of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]].<ref name=\"BWPRO\"/>\n\n==Education and early career==\nAfter graduating from high school in 1962, Liu applied to be a military pilot and passed all the associated exams. Despite his father's revolutionary credentials, Liu was declared unfit for military service because a relative had been denounced as a rightist. In autumn of the same year, Liu entered the People's Liberation Army Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, now known as [[Xidian University]]. Due to his political and class background, Liu was deemed unsuitable for such sensitive subjects and assigned to study radar. During his studies Liu received an introduction to computing.<ref name=\"Book1\"/>\n\nLiu was labeled an \"intellectual element\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In 1966, he told his classmates that the revolution was a terrible idea and was sent to a state-owned rice farm near [[Macau]] in [[Guangdong]] as a result. From there he was sent to a farm in [[Hunan]] dedicated to reform through hard labor. Liu returned to Beijing where he took up a post in 1970 as an engineer-administrator at the Computer Institute that had earlier developed the Number 104, Number 109, and Number 111 mainframe computers. Liu worked on the development of the Number 757 mainframe computer. In 1984, he resigned to become a cadre in the personnel office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.<ref name=\"Book1\"/> He remained there until he co-founded Legend in 1984.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>\n\n==Political opinions==\nUnlike many other Chinese business leaders, Liu has often spoken out on political issues. Liu has criticized others' tendency for silence. He said, \"when it comes to the inappropriate actions the government takes, businessmen don't have the courage or capacity to go against them; second, they lack the social responsibility to care for the whole world and what they do is to 'mind their own business.'\"<ref name=\"SILU\"/>\n\nDuring an interview with ''Caijing'' in October 2012, he advocated for what he called \"elite selection\" of political leaders. He said, \"I\u2019m not sure how practical it would be to have universal voting in the near future. I hope the country's leaders could be elected by the elites of the society.\" Liu is also deeply concerned with the rule of law. He said, \"My biggest worry is an unlawful world. I tell my employees to be careful all the time; don't disrespect the government or bribe anyone -  even so, I'm still not at peace because there are always some corrupt individuals coming along to cause problems.\"<ref name=\"SILU\"/>\n\nIn December 2013 Liu expressed optimism about economic reform in China. He said, \"Now if the market is to play a central role and the government only plays the referee, only you will decide if you are going to win the race.\"<ref name=\"SCMP2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1394668/lenovos-founder-liu-chuanzhi-talks-politics-again|title=Lenovo's founder Liu Chuanzhi 'talks politics' again|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Public service and awards==\n\nAs of 2002, Liu served as vice-chairman of the [[All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce]].<ref>{{cite news |title=LIU CHUANZHI CLAIMS PRC ENTREPRENEURS YEARN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF 'THREE LINKS'\n |author=Wang Zhao |url= |newspaper=World News Connection |date=18 October 2002}}</ref> Since 2004, Liu has served as director of the Computer Technology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites convert to [[Christianity]], band together and take the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gather their weapons, bury them, and commit to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites.  God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attack them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies do not attack back, instead allowing themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 have been killed, the Lamanites feel guilty and stop attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then join the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled. To avoid further attacks on them, God commands Ammon to lead the group to join the Nephites, and they change their name to the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|People of Ammon]] or Ammonites.  They are given the Land of Jershon by the Nephites.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 25 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng</ref>\n\nWhen an anti-christ named [[Korihor]] tries to teach atheism to the Ammonites, they bind him and take him to the high priest.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 30:21-29 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng</ref>\n\n===Stripling Warriors===\nIn a subsequent war between the Nephites and Lamanites, when the Ammonites saw how the Nephite army suffered in defending them, they considered breaking their oath to lay down their weapons and defend themselves; a Nephite prophet named [[Helaman (Book of Mormon)|Helaman]] persuaded them not to break their oath. Two thousand of their sons (who had been too young at the time to have made the pacifist covenant) volunteered to fight for the defense of the Nephites and the Ammonites.<ref name=\"Alma 53:18\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=53|verse=18}}</ref> The young men asked Helaman to be their commander. The young stripling warriors fought alongside the Nephite army and were one of the Nephites' most effective military units. Though every soldier was wounded at one time or another, there were no fatalities among the warriors. Helaman attributed this to the upbringing provided by their mothers and the great [[faith]] they exhibited.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 53 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng</ref>  The original 2,000 \"sons of Helaman\"<ref name=\"Alma 56:46\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=56|verse=46}}</ref> were later joined by sixty more, making a total of 2,060.<ref name=\"Alma 57:6\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=57|verse=6}}</ref>\n\nThe last time the people of Ammon are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, a large portion of them migrate to the \"land northward\" sometime between 49 and 39 BC.<ref>Book of Mormon Helaman 3:12 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng</ref>\n\n==Significance to the Latter Day Saint Movement==\nThe Anti-Nephi-Lehies are a well known and popular example of faith within the Latter Day Saint tradition, particlularly the story of the Stripling Warriors, which has become iconic, celebrated in Latter Day Saint artwork, toys, song, and literature.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 /><ref>Stripling Warriors are marketed to Latter-day Saint children. https://deseretbook.com/p/stripling-warrior-latter-day-designs-47472?variant_id=55823</ref> .<ref name=Patterson2002>Patterson, Robert. \u201cHelaman's Stripling Warriors and the Principles of Hypovolemic Shock.\u201d Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 35, no. 4, 2002, pp. 135\u2013141.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved.

Matthews, \"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337-339</ref>\n* Historian [[Dan Vogel]] notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of [[Lehi-Nephi]] was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping.  Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004).

Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W.

In both, the commandment reads, \"Get this people out of this land, ... therefore, get thee out of this land.\"<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe attack on the Nephites that is sparked by the attack on the Anti-Nephi-Lehies is described in two different narrative strands, once in Alma 16:6-9 and the other time in Alma 25:3, and 27:1.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites convert to [[Christianity]], band together and take the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gather their weapons, bury them, and commit to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E. Berrett wrote a critique of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies as part of his study of the Book of Mormon that would become a dominant narrative for the next several decades, calling their pacifist actions, \"an interesting experiment in non-resistance\" but ultimately not effective. \"Although the Anti-Nephi-Lehies received a short respite it was not long before it became apparent that to save their lives they must flee to the land of the Nephites and be protected by Nephite arms.\"<ref>William E.

Rather than commenting on the political morality of war, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies were used as examples of repentance and deep commitment that should be emulated in individual lives by \"burying\" sins in an equally permanent way.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 /><ref>Book of Mormon Seminary Teacher Outline (Salt Lake City: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1982), 161.</ref>  \n<ref>This interpretation is what historian Dan Vogel feels is the intended message of the Book of Mormon.

A textual clue occurs in Alma 23:5 which says the name was taken to be \"distinguished from their brethren [the Lamanites]\". There are several speculations as to the meaning of the name:\n\n* A common interpretation is that \"Anti\" means \"Not\" instead of \"against\", rendering the name to mean \"Not descendants of Nephi, but of Lehi\".<ref>Kent P. Jackson and Darrell L. Matthews, \"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337-339</ref>\n* Historian [[Dan Vogel]] notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of [[Lehi-Nephi]] was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping.  Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. Signature Books. e-book location 8365 of 19201</ref>\n\n\nLDS Church scholars who believe the Book of Mormon was written in [[reformed Egyptian| a language related to Egyptian]] with semitic influences suggest further potential meanings:\n\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] suggested that \"Anti\" may be a reflex of the Egyptian \"nty:\", ''he of, the one of.'' Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W. Nibley, Teachings of the Book of Mormon, Semester 2, p. 428</ref>\n* [[John Gee]], [[Brian M.

(2010). Understanding the Book of Mormon a readers guide. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  \n\nThe language that is used when the Lord commands the Anti-Nephi-Lehies to leave the Lamanite lands and go to the Nephite lands is identical in parts to an earlier section in the Book of Mormon where a prophet [[Alma the Elder|Alma]] is commanded to take his group of Nephite slaves out of the Lamanite lands.  In both, the commandment reads, \"Get this people out of this land, ... therefore, get thee out of this land.\"<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe attack on the Nephites that is sparked by the attack on the Anti-Nephi-Lehies is described in two different narrative strands, once in Alma 16:6-9 and the other time in Alma 25:3, and 27:1.  There is an inconsistency between the two accounts; in the first account the Lamanites are driven back after one great battle, while in the second there there are \"many battles\".<ref name=Hardy2010 />  Of the discrepancy, LDS Church Book of Mormon Scholar [[Grant Hardy]] writes that this might be an example of the narrator \"trying not to unduly burden his narrative with unnecessary details,\" and that one version is presented for historical reasons while the other is to promote a spiritual message.<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe text of the Book of Mormon notes that hundreds of the stripling warriors \"fainted because of blood\".<ref>Book of Mormon Chapter 57 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng</ref> Surgeon Robert Patterson observed of the miracle that \"the epic tale of the stripling warriors and their miraculous recovery from life-threatening trauma would appear, to the rational mind, highly unlikely or even outright impossible.
