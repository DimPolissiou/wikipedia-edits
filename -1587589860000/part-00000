In the UK, diagnosis is based on quite a narrow set of symptoms, and about 0.5\u20131% of children are thought to have attention or hyperactivity problems. In comparison, professionals in the U.S. used a much broader definition of the term ADHD until recently.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} This meant up to 10% of children in the U.S. were described as having ADHD. Current estimates suggest that ADHD is present internationally in about 7.2% of children.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/4/e994|journal = Pediatrics|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 25733754|pages = e994\u2013e1001|volume = 135|issue = 4|doi = 10.1542/peds.2014-3482|first = Rae|last = Thomas|first2 = Sharon|last2 = Sanders|first3 = Jenny|last3 = Doust|first4 = Elaine|last4 = Beller|first5 = Paul|last5 = Glasziou}}</ref> About five times more boys than girls are diagnosed with ADHD.

However, children from certain backgrounds may be particularly likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, because of different expectations about how they should behave.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} It is, therefore, important to ensure that a child's cultural background is understood and taken into account as part of the assessment.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1980, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-III .281980.29|DSM-III]] changed the name of the condition from \"hyperkinetic reaction of childhood\" to \"attention deficit disorder\" (ADD). That happened because research by [[Virginia Douglas]] had suggested that the attention deficits were more important than the hyperactive behaviour for understanding the disorder. The new label also reflected the observation of clinicians that attention deficits could also exist without hyperactivity.\n\nFor the first time, two subtypes were introduced: ADD with hyperactivity (ADD+H) and ADD without hyperactivity (ADD-H). While the ADD+H category was fairly consistent with previous definitions, the latter subtype represented essentially a new category. Thus, almost everything that is known about the predominantly inattentive subtype is based on research conducted since 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsource.com/LDA-CA/ADD_WO.html |first1=Jennifer |last1=Wheeler |first2=Caryn |last2=Carlson |date=3 July 1996 |title=Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity (ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type) |website=KidSource Online |accessdate=30 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111707/http://www.kidsource.com/LDA-CA/ADD_WO.html |archive-date=6 July 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = \n|  ICD10           = <!-- {{ICD10|Xxx.x}} -->\n|  ICD9            = <!-- {{ICD9|xxx}} -->\n|  ICDO            = \n|  OMIM            = \n|  MedlinePlus     = \n|  MeSH            = \n|  GeneReviewsNBK  = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n}}\n{{wiktionary|ADHD-PI|ADHD}}\n\n{{adhd|state=expanded}}\n{{amphetamine|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]\n[[Category:Amphetamine]]\n", "text_old": "{{bots|deny=Monkbot7}} <!-- keep Monkbot  from visiting this page -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n \n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive\n| synonyms        = Attention deficit disorder (without hyperactivity)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Biederman J, Faraone SV, Weber W, Russell RL, Rater M, Park KS |title=Correspondence between DSM-III-R and DSM-IV attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=1682\u20137 | date=December 1997 |pmid=9401329 |url=http://business.highbeam.com/5884/article-1G1-20383058/correspondence-between-dsmiiir-and-dsmiv-attentiondeficithyperactivity |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101145632/http://business.highbeam.com/5884/article-1G1-20383058/correspondence-between-dsmiiir-and-dsmiv-attentiondeficithyperactivity |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 1, 2013 |doi=10.1097/00004583-199712000-00016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lange KW, Reichl S, Lange KM, Tucha L, Tucha O |title=The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=241\u201355 | date=December 2010 |pmid=21258430 |pmc=3000907 |doi=10.1007/s12402-010-0045-8}}</ref>\n| image           = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = [[Psychiatry]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = Stimulant medication\n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive''' ('''ADHD-PI''' or '''ADHD-I'''),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Lawrence G.|title=WISC-IV clinical use and interpretation scientist-practitioner perspectives|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780125649315|page=237|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Eg9U9e_ICr8C&pg=PA237}}</ref> is one of the three presentations of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|author = American Psychiatric Association|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0890425558|location = Arlington|pages = [https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/59 59\u201365]|edition = 5th|url = https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/59}}</ref> In 1987&ndash;1994, there were no subtypes and thus it was not distinguished from hyperactive ADHD in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (DSM-III-R).\n\nThe 'predominantly inattentive subtype' is similar to the other presentations of ADHD except that it is characterized primarily by problems with inattention or a deficit of sustained attention, such as procrastination, hesitation, and forgetfulness.

The ADHD-PI presenting performed better than the ADHD-C group on measures of [[Flexibility (personality)|flexibility]], [[working memory]], [[Spatial ability|visual/spatial ability]], non-verbal IQ, [[Motor skill|motor ability]], and language. Both the ADHD-C and ADHD-PI groups were found to perform more poorly than the control group on measures of inhibition, however, there was no difference found between the two groups. Furthermore, the ADHD-C and ADHD-PI presenting did not differ on measures of sustained attention.\"<ref name=\"Lane, B. 2004\">{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Brittany Ann |year=2003 |title=The differential neuropsychological/cognitive profiles of ADHD presentations: A meta-analysis |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=University of Northern Colorado |oclc=56479200}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n\nIt is difficult to say exactly how many children or adults worldwide have ADHD because different countries have used different ways of diagnosing it, while some do not diagnose it at all. In the UK, diagnosis is based on quite a narrow set of symptoms, and about 0.5\u20131% of children are thought to have attention or hyperactivity problems. In comparison, professionals in the U.S. used a much broader definition of the term ADHD until recently.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} This meant up to 10% of children in the U.S. were described as having ADHD. Current estimates suggest that ADHD is present internationally in about 7.2% of children.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/4/e994|journal = Pediatrics|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 25733754|pages = e994\u2013e1001|volume = 135|issue = 4|doi = 10.1542/peds.2014-3482|first = Rae|last = Thomas|first2 = Sharon|last2 = Sanders|first3 = Jenny|last3 = Doust|first4 = Elaine|last4 = Beller|first5 = Paul|last5 = Glasziou}}</ref> About five times more boys than girls are diagnosed with ADHD.

Boys and girls both have attention problems, but boys are more likely to be overactive and difficult to manage.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} Children from all cultures and social groups are diagnosed with ADHD. However, children from certain backgrounds may be particularly likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, because of different expectations about how they should behave.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} It is, therefore, important to ensure that a child's cultural background is understood and taken into account as part of the assessment.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1980, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-III .281980.29|DSM-III]] changed the name of the condition from \"hyperkinetic reaction of childhood\" to \"attention deficit disorder\" (ADD). That happened because research by [[Virginia Douglas]] had suggested that the attention deficits were more important than the hyperactive behaviour for understanding the disorder. The new label also reflected the observation of clinicians that attention deficits could also exist without hyperactivity.\n\nFor the first time, two subtypes were introduced: ADD with hyperactivity (ADD+H) and ADD without hyperactivity (ADD-H). While the ADD+H category was fairly consistent with previous definitions, the latter subtype represented essentially a new category. Thus, almost everything that is known about the predominantly inattentive subtype is based on research conducted since 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsource.com/LDA-CA/ADD_WO.html |first1=Jennifer |last1=Wheeler |first2=Caryn |last2=Carlson |date=3 July 1996 |title=Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity (ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type) |website=KidSource Online |accessdate=30 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111707/http://www.kidsource.com/LDA-CA/ADD_WO.html |archive-date=6 July 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = \n|  ICD10           = <!-- {{ICD10|Xxx.x}} -->\n|  ICD9            = <!-- {{ICD9|xxx}} -->\n|  ICDO            = \n|  OMIM            = \n|  MedlinePlus     = \n|  MeSH            = \n|  GeneReviewsNBK  = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n}}\n{{wiktionary|ADHD-PI|ADHD}}\n\n{{adhd|state=expanded}}\n{{amphetamine|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]\n[[Category:Amphetamine]]\n", "name_user": "Philoserf", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 -WP:WCWproject (Spelling and typography)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive"}
