At the start, he was placed on the Manu tribe, along with returning ''Survivor'' castaways Kelley Wentworth and David Wright. On Day Eight, Underwood was blindsided by his tribe, who voted him out by a 5\u20132 margin. As he left the Tribal Council area, he came to a [[fork (intersection)|fork in the road]]. There, he read a sign telling him that he could either continue his game by taking a boat to the Edge of Extinction\u2014a desolate island even more brutal than the one from which he just came\u2014or go the other direction, to Ponderosa, and end his game for good. He chose the Edge of Extinction.\n\nUpon arrival at the Edge, he was greeted by fellow castaways Reem Daly and Keith Sowell, both of whom Underwood had a hand in voting out of the main game earlier. Daly welcomed him with an [[insult|acid tongue]], as payback for voting her out on Day Three. By Night 16, he had also been joined by three more castaways: Rick Devens and Wendy Diaz from his old Manu tribe, and returning player Aubry Bracco, originally from the Kama tribe. On Day 17, Underwood competed with the other voted-out castaways in a challenge that would allow the winner of it to return to the main game. Part of this challenge involved untying knots to get to the next leg, and before the challenge began, Underwood was hindered by Sowell, who played an advantage that required Underwood to untie more knots than everyone else during the course of the challenge. Devens would go on to win this challenge and return to the main competition, while the rest, including Underwood, returned to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nOn Night 19, Underwood, Daly, and Bracco were introduced to Tribal Council as the first three members of the jury. By Night 34, they would be joined on the Edge of Extinction by several other voted-off castaways who also were sent to the jury, until there were 11 players total populating the Edge of Extinction. On Day 35, another challenge took place, once again with the winner earning the right to return to the main game. This time, though, the losers would be eliminated for good, with no more chances of getting back into the main game whatsoever. Former Kama member and returning castaway Joe Anglim held the lead near the very end, but he repeatedly failed to complete the final leg of the challenge. This opened the door for Underwood, who completed the entire challenge first, thus sending him back into the main game after 27 nights on the Edge of Extinction.\n\nOnce back in the main competition, Underwood quickly made new allies in an attempt to keep the target off his back. He gave Devens one half of a two-piece immunity idol that he had received earlier in the day, as a reward for winning the challenge. Underwood also helped fellow castaway Julie Rosenberg win immunity on Day 36. He also successfully convinced Lauren O'Connell to play her hidden immunity idol on him later that night, despite the fact that he wasn't the main target at that night's Tribal Council. The next night, Devens won individual immunity and gave back the other half of Underwood's idol, allowing Underwood to play it to save himself. On Day 38, Underwood himself won immunity, but in a shocking move, gave the immunity necklace to Rosenberg so that he could try to eliminate Devens in a fire-making challenge that would determine who would join the other castaways, Gavin Whitson and Rosenberg, in the finals. Underwood would win this challenge, sending Devens out of the game again, and onto the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, the jury questioned Underwood's worthiness of being in the finals, given that he was in the main game for only 13 days. In response, Underwood noted that because he was on the edge of Extinction for so long, he only had a few days to make big moves to show that he was deserving of the title of Sole Survivor. He went on to say that he did just that, by playing one idol correctly, flushing someone else's idol as well, and giving up immunity to compete in, and win, a fire-making battle, all in the span of just three days. Jury member Julia Carter also defended him, by pointing out that he had done more in his short time in the main game than the other finalists had done in 39 days. Underwood also stated that, in the game of Survivor, one cannot \"screw around\" with other people in the game nor \"treat people like chess pieces;\" rather, one must have real relationships with others in the game in order to get to the end and win.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, it was revealed that Underwood had won the title of Sole Survivor,<ref name=\"MBOL\" /> by a 9\u20134\u20130 vote. He had received votes from everyone on the jury except Aurora McCreary, Devens, O'Connell, and Wentworth.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn August 2015, Underwood met a young woman named Katelyn Jermstad at a college party. Soon after, the two were dating, and on April 26, 2019, they got married.<ref name=\"wedding\" /> After winning the title of Sole Survivor, Underwood said that he and his wife were planning to move to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in the near future, and that he'd like to put some of his prize money into savings, while using some of it to travel before the couple starts having kids.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Donna Isabel |title='It takes a toll.'

At the start, he was placed on the Manu tribe, along with returning ''Survivor'' castaways Kelley Wentworth and David Wright. On Day Eight, Underwood was blindsided by his tribe, who voted him out by a 5\u20132 margin. As he left the Tribal Council area, he came to a [[fork (intersection)|fork in the road]]. There, he read a sign telling him that he could either continue his game by taking a boat to the Edge of Extinction\u2014a desolate island even more brutal than the one from which he just came\u2014or go the other direction, to Ponderosa, and end his game for good. He chose the Edge of Extinction.\n\nUpon arrival at the Edge, he was greeted by fellow castaways Reem Daly and Keith Sowell, both of whom Underwood had a hand in voting out of the main game earlier. Daly welcomed him with an [[insult|acid tongue]], as payback for voting her out on Day Three. By Night 16, he had also been joined by three more castaways: Rick Devens and Wendy Diaz from his old Manu tribe, and returning player Aubry Bracco, originally from the Kama tribe. On Day 17, Underwood competed with the other voted-out castaways in a challenge that would allow the winner of it to return to the main game. Part of this challenge involved untying knots to get to the next leg, and before the challenge began, Underwood was hindered by Sowell, who played an advantage that required Underwood to untie more knots than everyone else during the course of the challenge. Devens would go on to win this challenge and return to the main competition, while the rest, including Underwood, returned to the Edge of Extinction.\n\nOn Night 19, Underwood, Daly, and Bracco were introduced to Tribal Council as the first three members of the jury. By Night 34, they would be joined on the Edge of Extinction by several other voted-off castaways who also were sent to the jury, until there were 11 players total populating the Edge of Extinction. On Day 35, another challenge took place, once again with the winner earning the right to return to the main game. This time, though, the losers would be eliminated for good, with no more chances of getting back into the main game whatsoever. Former Kama member and returning castaway Joe Anglim held the lead near the very end, but he repeatedly failed to complete the final leg of the challenge. This opened the door for Underwood, who completed the entire challenge first, thus sending him back into the main game after 27 nights on the Edge of Extinction.\n\nOnce back in the main competition, Underwood quickly made new allies in an attempt to keep the target off his back. He gave Devens one half of a two-piece immunity idol that he had received earlier in the day, as a reward for winning the challenge. Underwood also helped fellow castaway Julie Rosenberg win immunity on Day 36. He also successfully convinced Lauren O'Connell to play her hidden immunity idol on him later that night, despite the fact that he wasn't the main target at that night's Tribal Council. The next night, Devens won individual immunity and gave back the other half of Underwood's idol, allowing Underwood to play it to save himself. On Day 38, Underwood himself won immunity, but in a shocking move, gave the immunity necklace to Rosenberg so that he could try to eliminate Devens in a fire-making challenge that would determine who would join the other castaways, Gavin Whitson and Rosenberg, in the finals. Underwood would win this challenge, sending Devens out of the game again, and onto the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, the jury questioned Underwood's worthiness of being in the finals, given that he was in the main game for only 13 days. In response, Underwood noted that because he was on the edge of Extinction for so long, he only had a few days to make big moves to show that he was deserving of the title of Sole Survivor. He went on to say that he did just that, by playing one idol correctly, flushing someone else's idol as well, and giving up immunity to compete in, and win, a fire-making battle, all in the span of just three days. Jury member Julia Carter also defended him, by pointing out that he had done more in his short time in the main game than the other finalists had done in 39 days. Underwood also stated that, in the game of Survivor, one cannot \"screw around\" with other people in the game nor \"treat people like chess pieces;\" rather, one must have real relationships with others in the game in order to get to the end and win.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, it was revealed that Underwood had won the title of Sole Survivor,<ref name=\"MBOL\" /> by a 9\u20134\u20130 vote. He had received votes from everyone on the jury except Aurora McCreary, Devens, O'Connell, and Wentworth.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn August 2015, Underwood met a young woman named Katelyn Jermstad at a college party. Soon after, the two were dating, and on April 26, 2019, they got married.<ref name=\"wedding\" /> After winning the title of Sole Survivor, Underwood said that he and his wife were planning to move to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in the near future, and that he'd like to put some of his prize money into savings, while using some of it to travel before the couple starts having kids.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Donna Isabel |title='It takes a toll.'

The record peaked at No 54. They had regional success in the Manchester area with \"My Tape's Gone\" (Razz 4), \"No Money\" / \"Oh Girl\" (Razz 5) and \"Yellow Spot\" (Razz 6). Radio 1, and in particular Mike Read, on his breakfast show, gave The Freshies a lot of airplay, especially the MCA release. The Freshies also produced a couple of \"jingles\" for the programme. After the \"success\" of \"I'm in Love with the Girl on the Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk\", they released further singles, \"Wrap Up the Rockets\" and \"I Can't Get Bouncing Babies by the Teardrop Explodes\", and although commercially successful in the Manchester area, they failed to make the national charts. They released 2 further cassettes, \"Manchester Plays The Freshies\" and \"London Plays The Freshies\", these were both essentially radio interviews with local and national DJs and concert recordings from each city. Chris had written his first LP by this stage, \"The Johnny Radar Story\", which, for various legal and contractual complications, was never released on vinyl. There are master copies on cassette in circulation though (albeit, very few).  By 1983, he had abandoned The Freshies and began moving in a new direction.\n\n== Frank Sidebottom ==\nThe character was instantly recognisable by his large spheroidal head, styled like an early [[Max Fleischer]] cartoon.

His character was cheerfully optimistic, enthusiastic, and seemingly oblivious to his own failings. Although supposedly 35 years old (the age always attributed to Frank irrespective of the passage of time), he still lived at home with his mother, to whom he made frequent references. His mother was apparently unaware of her son's popularity. Frank sometimes had a sidekick in the form of \"Little Frank\", a hand puppet who was otherwise a perfect copy of Frank.\n\nComedy character [[Mrs Merton]] started out as Frank's sidekick on his radio show ''Radio Timperley'', and the similarity of the characters is evident, exuding a sense of great ambition which belies a domestic lifestyle in the [[Northern England|North of England]].

The Frank Sidebottom character was initially created to be a fan of Sievey's band [[The Freshies]] but the popularity of the character led Sievey to focus his output on Frank Sidebottom comedy records, many of which were released on [[Marc Riley]]'s In-Tape record label of Manchester<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrawnandlard.co.uk/chronol.htm |title=ScrawnandLard.co.uk |publisher=ScrawnandLard.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref> and previous to that, on [[EMI]]'s [[Regal Zonophone]] imprint.\n\nHe developed a following in the late 1980s/early 1990s thanks to extensively touring the country. Performances were often varied from straightforward stand-up comedy and featured novelty components such as [[Tombola (raffle)|tombola]], and a lot of crowd interaction. Sometimes the show also included lectures. Contrasting with the [[alternative comedy|alternative comedians]] of the time, Frank Sidebottom's comedy was family-friendly, if a little bizarre for some.\n\nFrank was perhaps most popular in the [[North West of England]], where his success was caught up in that of the [[Madchester]] scene, and for a time was a regular on regional [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] station [[Granada Television|Granada]].

The record peaked at No 54. They had regional success in the Manchester area with \"My Tape's Gone\" (Razz 4), \"No Money\" / \"Oh Girl\" (Razz 5) and \"Yellow Spot\" (Razz 6). Radio 1, and in particular Mike Read, on his breakfast show, gave The Freshies a lot of airplay, especially the MCA release. The Freshies also produced a couple of \"jingles\" for the programme. After the \"success\" of \"I'm in Love with the Girl on the Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk\", they released further singles, \"Wrap Up the Rockets\" and \"I Can't Get Bouncing Babies by the Teardrop Explodes\", and although commercially successful in the Manchester area, they failed to make the national charts. They released 2 further cassettes, \"Manchester Plays The Freshies\" and \"London Plays The Freshies\", these were both essentially radio interviews with local and national DJs and concert recordings from each city. Chris had written his first LP by this stage, \"The Johnny Radar Story\", which, for various legal and contractual complications, was never released on vinyl. There are master copies on cassette in circulation though (albeit, very few).  By 1983, he had abandoned The Freshies and began moving in a new direction.\n\n== Frank Sidebottom ==\nThe character was instantly recognisable by his large spheroidal head, styled like an early [[Max Fleischer]] cartoon. This was initially made from [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], but later of [[fibreglass]].<ref name=\"ronson\">{{Cite news | last = Ronson | first = Jon | author-link = Jon Ronson | title = Oh blimey! | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 31 May 2006 | url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1786409,00.html | postscript = <!--None--> | location=London}}</ref> In the documentary ''Being Frank'', Martin Sievey (Chris's brother) states this was made using [[plaster of Paris]].<ref name=being>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beingfrankmovie.com/|title=Being Frank Movie|website=Beingfrankmovie.com}}</ref>\n\nFrank, usually dressed in a 1950s-style sharp suit, was portrayed as an aspiring pop star from the small village of [[Timperley]], near [[Manchester]]. His character was cheerfully optimistic, enthusiastic, and seemingly oblivious to his own failings. Although supposedly 35 years old (the age always attributed to Frank irrespective of the passage of time), he still lived at home with his mother, to whom he made frequent references. His mother was apparently unaware of her son's popularity. Frank sometimes had a sidekick in the form of \"Little Frank\", a hand puppet who was otherwise a perfect copy of Frank.\n\nComedy character [[Mrs Merton]] started out as Frank's sidekick on his radio show ''Radio Timperley'', and the similarity of the characters is evident, exuding a sense of great ambition which belies a domestic lifestyle in the [[Northern England|North of England]]. Sidebottom's former Oh Blimey Big Band members include [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] and [[Jon Ronson]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/may/31/art.popandrock|title=Oh blimey!|author=Jon Ronson|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 May 2006|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> and his driver was [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].<ref name=\"ronson\"/>\n\n=== History ===\n\nFrank was first revealed to the world on a [[12-inch]] promotional record which came free with the Chris Sievey-created video game ''[[The Biz (video game)|The Biz]]'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]] computer in 1984. The Frank Sidebottom character was initially created to be a fan of Sievey's band [[The Freshies]] but the popularity of the character led Sievey to focus his output on Frank Sidebottom comedy records, many of which were released on [[Marc Riley]]'s In-Tape record label of Manchester<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrawnandlard.co.uk/chronol.htm |title=ScrawnandLard.co.uk |publisher=ScrawnandLard.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref> and previous to that, on [[EMI]]'s [[Regal Zonophone]] imprint.\n\nHe developed a following in the late 1980s/early 1990s thanks to extensively touring the country. Performances were often varied from straightforward stand-up comedy and featured novelty components such as [[Tombola (raffle)|tombola]], and a lot of crowd interaction. Sometimes the show also included lectures. Contrasting with the [[alternative comedy|alternative comedians]] of the time, Frank Sidebottom's comedy was family-friendly, if a little bizarre for some.\n\nFrank was perhaps most popular in the [[North West of England]], where his success was caught up in that of the [[Madchester]] scene, and for a time was a regular on regional [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] station [[Granada Television|Granada]]. He even featured as a reporter on its regional news programme, ''Granada Reports''. At one point Frank had his own television show on ITV entitled ''Frank Sidebottom's Fantastic Shed Show'', first broadcast in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CMKK |title=Amazon.co.uk |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref> He also made numerous appearances on [[Channel 4]], including the British version of the game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)#Foreign versions and attempts|Remote Control]]'' which was presented by [[Anthony H Wilson|Tony Wilson]], where each week he would pose \"Frank's Fantastic Question\" to the contestants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycv.co.uk/franksidebottom/index.htm |title=ComedyCV.co.uk |publisher=ComedyCV.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080506122214/http://www.comedycv.co.uk/franksidebottom/index.htm |archivedate = 6 May 2008}}</ref> He also made several appearances on the [[Television South]]/ITV Saturday morning children's shows ''[[No. 73]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8752000/8752639.stm |title=BBC \u2013 Frank Sidebottom creator Chris Sievey was \"a genius\" |work=BBC News |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010}}</ref> and ''[[What's Up Doc?

His new show, ''Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show in B/W'', featured celebrity guests and animation. The first showing of each show was in black and white (\"so you don't have to turn the colour down\"), whilst subsequent repeats were shown in full colour. He also made five appearances on [[Iain Lee]]'s programme on London's [[LBC]] as well as on numerous [[community radio]] stations such as Forever Manchester. Frank appeared as a [[test card]] shown late at night on Channel M, where he and Little Frank ramble on and sing songs whilst framed in a parody of the classic [[Test Card F]]. On 6 March 2007, in an episode of ''[[the Podge and Rodge Show]]'' on Ireland's [[RT\u00c9 Two]], he appeared in their 'Sham-Rock' talent section, performing a medley of songs by [[The Smiths]]. He received an overall score of 22 points from judges [[James Nesbitt]] and [[Glenda Gilson]], putting him in first place for all the series' acts so far.\n\nFrank starred in his own exhibition of drawings, animation and cardboard at London's [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] Space Gallery next to [[Tate Britain]] between 4 July and 4 August 2007.

The words like [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''kutsiy'' and [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''kus\u00fd'', also derived from *ker-, are one of chort's most common epithets.

It is often trying to tease characters in selling their souls in exchange for something (money, power, completion of a task). This often ends badly for evil or greedy characters, who are tricked into getting useless gifts and then are carried into hell. Other times, ''\u010dert'' changes roles from trickster to tricked as he loses a bet against a hero, who outsmarts him, winning his soul back. This way, ''\u010dert'' is often tricked to build castle walls in a day, dig fish ponds or even whole river banks, move large stones or create hills and mountains. Sometimes, a positive role of ''\u010dert'' is further emphasized, namely in modern or modernized folk tales. ''\u010cert'' is trying to bring evil characters to hell, he often helps or befriends heroes in this process and gives them various magical items and treasures.\n\nThe true form of ''\u010cert'' is often a smallish hairy man with a tail, horns and one or two hoofs. But he is a shapeshifter and he tries to trick characters in his nicer forms, before they even realize what he is. In these forms, he is often represented as pretty young man, count, or huntsman (see ''[[The Devil and Kate]]''). Often, this transformation is not (and cannot be) complete, so one can recognize ''\u010dert'' by small horns hidden in black curly hair, or a single hoofed leg hidden in high boots.\n\n''\u010cert'' is not the devil, although they might have a lot in common.

One is that it's a [[Substantivization|substantivized]] t-participle of ''*ker-'' (to cut, to chop), which could be derived from chorts imagined as being lame (having one leg shorter). The words like [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''kutsiy'' and [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''kus\u00fd'', also derived from *ker-, are one of chort's most common epithets. According to a more recent hypothesis, Proto-Slavic ''*\u010d\u044crt\u044a'' represents a derivative of ''*\u010dersti / \u010d\u044crt\u01eb'' \u2018to draw a line, furrow\u2019. One way to interpret this derivation is reconstructing ''*\u010d\u044crt\u044a'' as a supernatural Draughtsman in charge of determining human fate. Under this hypothesis, the original god of destiny came to be perceived as the bringer of death and then syncretised with the embodiment of all evil in the Christian tradition <ref>I. Yakubovich. \u201cThe Slavic Draughtsman\u201d. ''Etymology and the European Lexicon. Proceedings of the 14th Fachtagung der Indogermanischen Gesellschaft'', B. S. S. Hansen et al.

It is often trying to tease characters in selling their souls in exchange for something (money, power, completion of a task). This often ends badly for evil or greedy characters, who are tricked into getting useless gifts and then are carried into hell. Other times, ''\u010dert'' changes roles from trickster to tricked as he loses a bet against a hero, who outsmarts him, winning his soul back. This way, ''\u010dert'' is often tricked to build castle walls in a day, dig fish ponds or even whole river banks, move large stones or create hills and mountains. Sometimes, a positive role of ''\u010dert'' is further emphasized, namely in modern or modernized folk tales. ''\u010cert'' is trying to bring evil characters to hell, he often helps or befriends heroes in this process and gives them various magical items and treasures.\n\nThe true form of ''\u010cert'' is often a smallish hairy man with a tail, horns and one or two hoofs. But he is a shapeshifter and he tries to trick characters in his nicer forms, before they even realize what he is. In these forms, he is often represented as pretty young man, count, or huntsman (see ''[[The Devil and Kate]]''). Often, this transformation is not (and cannot be) complete, so one can recognize ''\u010dert'' by small horns hidden in black curly hair, or a single hoofed leg hidden in high boots.\n\n''\u010cert'' is not the devil, although they might have a lot in common.
