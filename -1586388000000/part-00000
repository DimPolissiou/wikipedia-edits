His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District.

Over a nineteen-year professional career (1978\u20131997), he played for [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]], [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]].<ref name=\"Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org\"/> He won 36 caps for [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]], captaining the team from 1988 to 1992, and 2 for [[England national rugby league team|England]]. Nicknamed 'Mr Magic' and 'The Black Pearl', he played most often as a {{rlp|so}} or {{rlp|lf}} after starting out as a {{rlp|ce}} or {{rlp|wg}}. \n\nHanley won the [[Man of Steel Award]] a record three times, the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] once, and the [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award|Golden Boot]] in 1988. He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in January 1990 for services to the game. In 2005 he was inducted into the [[Rugby Football League Hall of Fame]].\n\nAfter his playing career, he had spells as head coach of Great Britain, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]] and [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].\n\n==Biography==\nHanley was born in [[Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, of Jamaican descent.<ref>http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/jamaica-s-brave-new-world-1-2556629</ref>\n\n===Bradford Northern===\nIn 1978, Hanley signed for Bradford Northern from the junior club Corpus Christi.<ref name=\"Wigan Warriors\">[http://www.wiganwarriors.com/SquadMember.asp?teamid=5&id=95 Wigan Warriors Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117120725/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/SquadMember.asp?teamid=5&id=95 |date=17 January 2006 }} Ellery Hanley MBE article.

In the 1987 season, Hanley was awarded the [[Man of Steel award]], being voted the player who made the biggest impact during the season. His play that year helped Wigan to their first league title in 27 years. He played in Wigan's [[1987 World Club Challenge]] victory against the visiting [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\nHanley holds the record for the most tries in a [[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]] (or precursors) Final with 3 [[Try (rugby)|tries]].\n\nIn 1988, Hanley was in dispute with Wigan and was stripped of the captaincy. He was transfer listed at a then record \u00a3350,000. But when Wigan reached the semi-final of the 1988 Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] against Salford, coach [[Graham Lowe]] recalled Hanley to the team. Upon his return Hanley scored a [[Try (rugby)|try]] in the final. Hanley scored a try at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Ironically it was set up by [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] \u2013 reminiscent of the two tries he scored against Wigan four years earlier. [[Ray French (rugby)|Ray French]] stated it was the second greatest ever seen in a final.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/challenge_cup/3423959.stm]\n\nHanley was then selected as captain for the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]]. The Lions defeated [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] but lost [[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]] to Australia, losing the first two tests in [[Sydney Football Stadium|Sydney]] and [[Lang Park|Brisbane]]. The third test was a triumph for Hanley and his Lions though as they defeated Australia for the first time in a test match since 5 November [[1978 Kangaroo tour|1978]], ending Australia's streak of 15 straight wins over Great Britain. The Lions then defeated New Zealand 12\u201310 in [[Addington Showground|Christchurch]] for their only test in NZ to finish the tour on a high note.\n\nIn 1989, Hanley helped the club reach the [[Challenge Cup]] Final, where they won a 27\u20130 victory over St Helens in front of a crowd of approximately 78,000 people at Wembley, the first time in [[Challenge Cup Final|Cup Final]] history at Wembley that a side had been held scoreless. He was awarded the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] for the man of the match.<ref>{{cite news \n|last = Demsteader\n|first = Christine\n|author2 = \n|title = Rugby League's home from home\n|work = BBC Sport\n|place =UK\n|pages = \n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 1 October 2000\n|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/wembley/944481.stm\n|accessdate = 4 December 2009}}</ref> For his performances throughout the season he was also awarded the Man of Steel award for the second time as a Wigan player, and the third time in his overall career. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas Golden Boot, which was awarded to the world's most outstanding player. Hanley remembers that \"It was something I always strove for. I wanted to be the best player in the world\u2026 Looking back, to be the world's best player at that time was the biggest honour of my career.\"<ref name=\"IS Ellery Hanley\">[http://www.insidesport.com.au/is/index?pg=adrenalin&spg=drinks/drinks_ellery_hanley.htm \"A few drinks with Ellery Hanley\"] article.

Hanley captained Great Britain against the [[1990 Kangaroo tour|1990 Kangaroos]], and although they pulled off a shock 19\u201312 win over Australia in the first test at Wembley with Hanley playing a prominent role, the Kangaroos would come back to win the second and third tests to extend their Ashes series streak over the Lions which dated back to [[1973 Kangaroo tour|1973]]. Prior to the arrival of the Kangaroos in England, Hanley's influence in the British game was shown. During one early season Wigan game leading English referee Robin Whitfield sent Hanley off for back-chat and as he departed the field Hanley allegedly told Whitfield that he would end up in the second division. Hanley was originally handed a 2 match suspension for his actions. However, upon appeal this was reduced to just one week, and Whitfield, despite his standing as one of the games top officials, refereed the second division for the next 6 weeks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGregor|first1=Adrian|title=Simply the Best: The 1990 Kangaroos|date=1991|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia|isbn=0702223700|page=160}}</ref>\n\nHe led Wigan to another two League and Cup doubles. By 1991 though his relationship with the media reached an all-time low. Although both Wigan and Great Britain captain, he was not expected to carry out any media role. \n\nIn total he spent around five years with the club, making 202 appearances and scoring 189 tries. In his Wigan career, he won a World Club Championship, 4 Challenge Cup winners medals, 3 Championships, 1 Premiership, 4 John Player Trophy Winners medals and 4 Lancashire Cup winners medals. He was also voted Man of Steel twice as a Wigan player. Hanley was inducted into the [[Wigan Hall of Fame]] in 2007.\n\n===Balmain (1988)===\nHanley, the Great Britain captain, was signed by Sydney club [[Balmain Tigers]] to play the remaining rounds of the [[1988 NSWRFL season]] for them once his representative commitments were fulfilled.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=John|title=Tigers sign Hanley for last Rounds|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news880629_0300_5228|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=29 June 1988}}</ref> In his first season with the club he helped them to the Grand Final in 1988 against Canterbury by defeating Penrith, [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]], [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] as well as [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]] in the preliminary finals. The preliminary final against Cronulla was a closely fought battle, until Hanley went to set up the try that would seal the victory for Balmain as they edged out their opponents 9\u20132, the win sending the club to their first Grand Final since 1969.\n\nThe first half of the Grand Final was a tight contest as [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] led 6\u20134 scoring due to a mistake from Canterbury {{rlp|fb}} [[Jason Alchin]]. In the 26th minute, Hanley was wrapped up low by [[Andrew Farrar]], and as he want to offload the ball, Terry Lamb hit Hanley with a high tackle<ref>{{cite news \n|last = Coady\n|first = Ben\n|author2 = \n|title = Grand final dramas\n|work = WA Today\n|place =Australia\n|pages = \n|publisher = Fairfax Digital\n|date = 28 September 2009\n|url = http://blogs.watoday.com.au/executive-style/sportandstyle/bencoady/2009/09/28/grandfinaldra.html\n|accessdate = 15 January 2010}}</ref> that went unnoticed by the referee.

Lamb said he was only looking to wrap the ball up and there was no intention. Lamb commented in his 1992 book that Balmain had key players such as [[Wayne Pearce]], [[Ben Elias]], [[Paul Sironen]] and [[Garry Jack]] that there was no chance to target one individual.\n\nSpeaking to '''Inside Sport Magazine''' in August 2005, Hanley was asked:\n<blockquote>\n'''What do you remember about that infamous tackle by Terry Lamb?'''\n''\"I don\u2019t know if it was caused by Terry Lamb, or if it was just my head hitting the ground. I couldn\u2019t tell you because I have never looked at it since. Some people have said Terry got a good shot on me. I suspect, however, it was more a case of my head hitting the ground. I like to think it was accidental. Afterwards, I was concussed and didn\u2019t know where I was. I didn\u2019t regain all my faculties immediately so, from a safety point of view, I had to come off the football field. It was a shame, but it is a physical game and sometimes things like that happen.\"''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Have you spoken to Lamb since then?'''\n''\"No, I never have. I have never bumped into him. I have to say I respect him as a footballer. I don't know him as a person, but by all accounts he is a good guy. Let me be clear that I have no malice towards him, none at all, regardless of the incident being deliberate or accidental.\"''<ref name=\"IS Ellery Hanley\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby League]], despite the media pressure, backed up Lamb's version of events and deemed he had no case to answer.\n\n===Western Suburbs===\nIn 1989, Hanley moved from Balmain to [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]]. He played a total of thirteen games, scoring four tries for a total of sixteen points in his one and only season for the club. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award]], which was awarded to the world's most outstanding player.\n\n===Leeds===\nIn September 1991 at the age of 30, he joined Leeds as a player and [[Coach (sport)|coach]] for \u00a3250,000, and on his arrival at the club, was immediately appointed captain. \n\nHe was selected to go on the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]], but his appearances were restricted by injury. Also in 1992 he played from the bench in Great Britain's defeat by Australia in the World Cup Final at Wembley.\n\nThe [[1993\u201394 Rugby Football League season|1993\u201394 season]] saw Hanley play in the Challenge Cup Final for the first time with Leeds. In the previous game, the Challenge Cup semi-final, Leeds faced St Helens at Central Park.  Hanley scored two tries to put the club back on the big stage for the first time in sixteen years. In the Final, the club's opponents were Hanley's former club Wigan. In front of an official attendance at Wembley of 78,348, Leeds were defeated 16\u201326 by Wigan.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 Rugby Football League season|1994\u201395 season]], Hanley set a new world record for a forward, scoring 41 tries in a season. During that season, Hanley helped the club reach the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley for the second consecutive year. Ironically it was the same opponent that they faced a year earlier in the same competition final. In front of an attendance of 78,550 they were defeated, just as they had been a year earlier by their opponents, this time going down 30\u201310.\n\nWhilst playing for Leeds, the [[NFL Europe|World League of American football]] was formed in 1991. It was reported that Hanley would play for the [[London Monarchs]] but this never materialised.\n\n===Balmain (1996\u201397)===\nIn 1996 and well past his prime, Hanley returned to the Australian club Balmain for his second spell with the club. Hanley stated that \"I wanted to be respected by the Australians as well, because their game is so superior to ours.\"<ref name=\"IS Ellery Hanley\"/>\n\n==Representative career==\nHanley won [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[England national rugby league team|England]] while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against Wales, while at Leeds in 1992 against Wales,<ref name=\"England Statistics at englandrl.co.uk\"/> and won [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against France (sub), France, Australia (3 matches), New Zealand (3 matches), and Papua New Guinea, in 1985 against France (2 matches), while at Wigan in 1985 against New Zealand (3 matches), in 1986 against France, and Australia, in 1987 against France (2 matches), and Papua New Guinea, in 1988 against France (2 matches), Papua New Guinea, Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand, in 1989 against France (2 matches), in 1990 against France, and Australia (3 matches), in 1991 against France (2 matches), while at Leeds in 1992 against Australia, in 1993 against France.<ref name=\"Great Britain Statistics at englandrl.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Great Britain===\nHe made his Great Britain d\u00e9but as a substitute, whilst still a Bradford Northern player, in January 1984 against [[France national rugby league team|France]] in [[Avignon]]. He was selected in the Great Britain squad in 1984 to tour to Australia and was one of the stars of the 1984 Ashes series, scoring a remarkable twelve tries playing mostly on the wing.\n\nIn 1988, he became a regular member of the Great Britain team and was appointed captain. In the 1988 Ashes series, he led his side to victory over Australia for the first time in 10 seasons. Along the way he also scored eight tries.\n\nHanley also toured Australia in 1992 for the Ashes series, but despite being captain of the squad, on the field he made only one appearance and played less than fifteen minutes in a minor tour match against Newcastle.\n\nIn total he was capped 34 times by Great Britain.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn 1994 following [[Mal Reilly]]'s decision to step down as both Great Britain and [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] coach to become coach of Australian club the [[Newcastle Knights]], Hanley was appointed coach of the Great Britain Lions during the Ashes series against Australia during the [[1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. His appointment meant he had become the first black person to coach or manage a major national team in Great Britain. After a 12-man Lions team pulled off a gutsy 8\u20134 win in the first test at Wembley (following the first half send-off of captain [[Shaun Edwards]] for a high tackle), they lost the series when Australia won the second test 34\u20138 at [[Old Trafford]], and 23\u20134 at [[Elland Road]] in Leeds.\n\nThe 1994 Ashes series would prove to be Hanley's only time as Great Britain coach. For the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] held in England and Wales, Great Britain was not playing, with [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] competing instead. Also, Hanley had signed with the [[Australian Rugby League]] during the [[Super League war]] which began in 1995 while the RFL were aligned with the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]].<ref name=\"Coach Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org\"/>\n\nIn 1999, he was appointed as the coach of [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] as the successor to [[Shaun McRae]]. In his first season as coach, he led St. Helens to the [[1999 Super League Grand Final]]. His side defeated the [[Bradford Bulls]], the club he began his professional playing career at, by 8\u20136 in October of that year. Whilst he harboured a strong desire to win, he could appear aloof and had several acrimonious disagreements with the St. Helens board of directors, which led to his suspension<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Blackshaw\n|first = Ian Stewart\n|authorlink = \n|title = Mediating sports disputes: national and international perspectives \n|publisher = Cambridge University Press\n|year = 2002\n|location = \n|pages = 86\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0s6hi7mGZ70C&printsec=frontcover\n|doi = \n|isbn = 9789067041461}}</ref> and eventual sacking as the manager of St Helens in 2000. [[Ian Millward]] was appointed as his successor.\n\nHe switched to rugby union coaching and took up posts with [[Bristol Rugby]], and in the England national set-up. He also got involved in the sport of [[Squash (sport)|squash]] before returning to rugby league as a coaching consultant with [[Castleford Tigers]] in 2004. He worked with Cas for just two months before leaving.\n\nOn 14 December 2007 Hanley was unveiled as the coach of National League Two Club [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/7144151.stm|title=BBC SPORT \u2013 Rugby League \u2013 Hanley appointed Doncaster coach|work=bbc.co.uk|date=14 December 2007}}</ref> He resigned from that r\u00f4le on 28 September 2008, following Doncaster's successful promotion play-off campaign.\n\n==Recognition==\nIn January 1990 he was honoured with an MBE by the Queen for his services to rugby league. In October 2005, he was inducted into the [[Rugby Football League Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news \n|last = news.bbc.co.uk\n|first = \n|author2 = \n|title = Hanley given Hall of Fame honour\n|work = BBC Sport\n|place =\n|pages = \n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 17 October 2005\n|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/4349690.stm\n|accessdate = 2 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Outside rugby==\nIn 2009 Hanley was one of thirteen celebrities taking part in the [[Dancing on Ice (Series 4)|new series]] of ''[[Dancing on Ice (UK)|Dancing on Ice]]'', partnered with [[Frankie Poultney]]. He was the sixth person to be eliminated from the show, after falling on the ice during the final dance-off.

Over a nineteen-year professional career (1978-1997), he played for [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]], [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]].<ref name=\"Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org\"/> He won 36 caps for [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]], captaining the team from 1988 to 1992, and 2 for [[England national rugby league team|England]]. Nicknamed 'Mr Magic' and 'The Black Pearl', he played most often as a {{rlp|so}} or {{rlp|lf}} after starting out as a {{rlp|ce}} or {{rlp|wg}}. \n\nHanley won the [[Man of Steel Award]] a record three times, the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] once, and the [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award|Golden Boot]] in 1988. He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in January 1990 for services to the game. In 2005 he was inducted into the [[Rugby Football League Hall of Fame]].\n\nAfter his playing career, he had spells as head coach of Great Britain, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]] and [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].\n\n==Biography==\nHanley was born in [[Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, of Jamaican descent.<ref>http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/jamaica-s-brave-new-world-1-2556629</ref>\n\n===Bradford Northern===\nIn 1978, Hanley signed for Bradford Northern from the junior club Corpus Christi.<ref name=\"Wigan Warriors\">[http://www.wiganwarriors.com/SquadMember.asp?teamid=5&id=95 Wigan Warriors Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117120725/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/SquadMember.asp?teamid=5&id=95 |date=17 January 2006 }} Ellery Hanley MBE article.

In the 1987 season, Hanley was awarded the [[Man of Steel award]], being voted the player who made the biggest impact during the season. His play that year helped Wigan to their first league title in 27 years. He played in Wigan's [[1987 World Club Challenge]] victory against the visiting [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\nHanley holds the record for the most tries in a [[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]] (or precursors) Final with 3 [[Try (rugby)|tries]].\n\nIn 1988, Hanley was in dispute with Wigan and was stripped of the captaincy. He was transfer listed at a then record \u00a3350,000. But when Wigan reached the semi-final of the 1988 Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] against Salford, coach [[Graham Lowe]] recalled Hanley to the team. Upon his return Hanley scored a [[Try (rugby)|try]] in the final. Hanley scored a try at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Ironically it was set up by [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] \u2013 reminiscent of the two tries he scored against Wigan four years earlier. [[Ray French (rugby)|Ray French]] stated it was the second greatest ever seen in a final.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/challenge_cup/3423959.stm]\n\nHanley was then selected as captain for the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]]. The Lions defeated [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] but lost [[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]] to Australia, losing the first two tests in [[Sydney Football Stadium|Sydney]] and [[Lang Park|Brisbane]]. The third test was a triumph for Hanley and his Lions though as they defeated Australia for the first time in a test match since 5 November [[1978 Kangaroo tour|1978]], ending Australia's streak of 15 straight wins over Great Britain. The Lions then defeated New Zealand 12\u201310 in [[Addington Showground|Christchurch]] for their only test in NZ to finish the tour on a high note.\n\nIn 1989, Hanley helped the club reach the [[Challenge Cup]] Final, where they won a 27\u20130 victory over St Helens in front of a crowd of approximately 78,000 people at Wembley, the first time in [[Challenge Cup Final|Cup Final]] history at Wembley that a side had been held scoreless. He was awarded the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] for the man of the match.<ref>{{cite news \n|last = Demsteader\n|first = Christine\n|author2 = \n|title = Rugby League's home from home\n|work = BBC Sport\n|place =UK\n|pages = \n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 1 October 2000\n|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/wembley/944481.stm\n|accessdate = 4 December 2009}}</ref> For his performances throughout the season he was also awarded the Man of Steel award for the second time as a Wigan player, and the third time in his overall career. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas Golden Boot, which was awarded to the world's most outstanding player. Hanley remembers that \"It was something I always strove for. I wanted to be the best player in the world\u2026 Looking back, to be the world's best player at that time was the biggest honour of my career.\"<ref name=\"IS Ellery Hanley\">[http://www.insidesport.com.au/is/index?pg=adrenalin&spg=drinks/drinks_ellery_hanley.htm \"A few drinks with Ellery Hanley\"] article. URL retrieved 5 August 2006.</ref>\n\nInternationally, 1990 was a disappointment. Hanley captained Great Britain against the [[1990 Kangaroo tour|1990 Kangaroos]], and although they pulled off a shock 19\u201312 win over Australia in the first test at Wembley with Hanley playing a prominent role, the Kangaroos would come back to win the second and third tests to extend their Ashes series streak over the Lions which dated back to [[1973 Kangaroo tour|1973]]. Prior to the arrival of the Kangaroos in England, Hanley's influence in the British game was shown. During one early season Wigan game leading English referee Robin Whitfield sent Hanley off for back-chat and as he departed the field Hanley allegedly told Whitfield that he would end up in the second division. Hanley was originally handed a 2 match suspension for his actions. However, upon appeal this was reduced to just one week, and Whitfield, despite his standing as one of the games top officials, refereed the second division for the next 6 weeks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGregor|first1=Adrian|title=Simply the Best: The 1990 Kangaroos|date=1991|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia|isbn=0702223700|page=160}}</ref>\n\nHe led Wigan to another two League and Cup doubles. By 1991 though his relationship with the media reached an all-time low. Although both Wigan and Great Britain captain, he was not expected to carry out any media role. \n\nIn total he spent around five years with the club, making 202 appearances and scoring 189 tries. In his Wigan career, he won a World Club Championship, 4 Challenge Cup winners medals, 3 Championships, 1 Premiership, 4 John Player Trophy Winners medals and 4 Lancashire Cup winners medals. He was also voted Man of Steel twice as a Wigan player. Hanley was inducted into the [[Wigan Hall of Fame]] in 2007.\n\n===Balmain (1988)===\nHanley, the Great Britain captain, was signed by Sydney club [[Balmain Tigers]] to play the remaining rounds of the [[1988 NSWRFL season]] for them once his representative commitments were fulfilled.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=John|title=Tigers sign Hanley for last Rounds|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news880629_0300_5228|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=29 June 1988}}</ref> In his first season with the club he helped them to the Grand Final in 1988 against Canterbury by defeating Penrith, [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]], [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] as well as [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]] in the preliminary finals. The preliminary final against Cronulla was a closely fought battle, until Hanley went to set up the try that would seal the victory for Balmain as they edged out their opponents 9\u20132, the win sending the club to their first Grand Final since 1969.\n\nThe first half of the Grand Final was a tight contest as [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] led 6\u20134 scoring due to a mistake from Canterbury {{rlp|fb}} [[Jason Alchin]]. In the 26th minute, Hanley was wrapped up low by [[Andrew Farrar]], and as he want to offload the ball, Terry Lamb hit Hanley with a high tackle<ref>{{cite news \n|last = Coady\n|first = Ben\n|author2 = \n|title = Grand final dramas\n|work = WA Today\n|place =Australia\n|pages = \n|publisher = Fairfax Digital\n|date = 28 September 2009\n|url = http://blogs.watoday.com.au/executive-style/sportandstyle/bencoady/2009/09/28/grandfinaldra.html\n|accessdate = 15 January 2010}}</ref> that went unnoticed by the referee. He hit the ground in an awkward position and was concussed. He played no further part in the match, and his side went on to lose the game 24\u201312. Lamb said he was only looking to wrap the ball up and there was no intention. Lamb commented in his 1992 book that Balmain had key players such as [[Wayne Pearce]], [[Ben Elias]], [[Paul Sironen]] and [[Garry Jack]] that there was no chance to target one individual.\n\nSpeaking to '''Inside Sport Magazine''' in August 2005, Hanley was asked:\n<blockquote>\n'''What do you remember about that infamous tackle by Terry Lamb?'''\n''\"I don\u2019t know if it was caused by Terry Lamb, or if it was just my head hitting the ground. I couldn\u2019t tell you because I have never looked at it since. Some people have said Terry got a good shot on me. I suspect, however, it was more a case of my head hitting the ground. I like to think it was accidental. Afterwards, I was concussed and didn\u2019t know where I was. I didn\u2019t regain all my faculties immediately so, from a safety point of view, I had to come off the football field. It was a shame, but it is a physical game and sometimes things like that happen.\"''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Have you spoken to Lamb since then?'''\n''\"No, I never have. I have never bumped into him. I have to say I respect him as a footballer. I don't know him as a person, but by all accounts he is a good guy. Let me be clear that I have no malice towards him, none at all, regardless of the incident being deliberate or accidental.\"''<ref name=\"IS Ellery Hanley\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby League]], despite the media pressure, backed up Lamb's version of events and deemed he had no case to answer.\n\n===Western Suburbs===\nIn 1989, Hanley moved from Balmain to [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]]. He played a total of thirteen games, scoring four tries for a total of sixteen points in his one and only season for the club. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas [[Rugby League World Golden Boot Award]], which was awarded to the world's most outstanding player.\n\n===Leeds===\nIn September 1991 at the age of 30, he joined Leeds as a player and [[Coach (sport)|coach]] for \u00a3250,000, and on his arrival at the club, was immediately appointed captain. \n\nHe was selected to go on the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]], but his appearances were restricted by injury. Also in 1992 he played from the bench in Great Britain's defeat by Australia in the World Cup Final at Wembley.\n\nThe [[1993\u201394 Rugby Football League season|1993\u201394 season]] saw Hanley play in the Challenge Cup Final for the first time with Leeds. In the previous game, the Challenge Cup semi-final, Leeds faced St Helens at Central Park.  Hanley scored two tries to put the club back on the big stage for the first time in sixteen years. In the Final, the club's opponents were Hanley's former club Wigan. In front of an official attendance at Wembley of 78,348, Leeds were defeated 16-26 by Wigan.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 Rugby Football League season|1994\u201395 season]], Hanley set a new world record for a forward, scoring 41 tries in a season. During that season, Hanley helped the club reach the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley for the second consecutive year. Ironically it was the same opponent that they faced a year earlier in the same competition final. In front of an attendance of 78,550 they were defeated, just as they had been a year earlier by their opponents, this time going down 30\u201310.\n\nWhilst playing for Leeds, the [[NFL Europe|World League of American football]] was formed in 1991. It was reported that Hanley would play for the [[London Monarchs]] but this never materialised.\n\n===Balmain (1996\u201397)===\nIn 1996 and well past his prime, Hanley returned to the Australian club Balmain for his second spell with the club. Hanley stated that \"I wanted to be respected by the Australians as well, because their game is so superior to ours.\"<ref name=\"IS Ellery Hanley\"/>\n\n==Representative career==\nHanley won [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[England national rugby league team|England]] while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against Wales, while at Leeds in 1992 against Wales,<ref name=\"England Statistics at englandrl.co.uk\"/> and won [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against France (sub), France, Australia (3 matches), New Zealand (3 matches), and Papua New Guinea, in 1985 against France (2 matches), while at Wigan in 1985 against New Zealand (3 matches), in 1986 against France, and Australia, in 1987 against France (2 matches), and Papua New Guinea, in 1988 against France (2 matches), Papua New Guinea, Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand, in 1989 against France (2 matches), in 1990 against France, and Australia (3 matches), in 1991 against France (2 matches), while at Leeds in 1992 against Australia, in 1993 against France.<ref name=\"Great Britain Statistics at englandrl.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Great Britain===\nHe made his Great Britain d\u00e9but as a substitute, whilst still a Bradford Northern player, in January 1984 against [[France national rugby league team|France]] in [[Avignon]]. He was selected in the Great Britain squad in 1984 to tour to Australia and was one of the stars of the 1984 Ashes series, scoring a remarkable twelve tries playing mostly on the wing.\n\nIn 1988, he became a regular member of the Great Britain team and was appointed captain. In the 1988 Ashes series, he led his side to victory over Australia for the first time in 10 seasons. Along the way he also scored eight tries.\n\nHanley also toured Australia in 1992 for the Ashes series, but despite being captain of the squad, on the field he made only one appearance and played less than fifteen minutes in a minor tour match against Newcastle.\n\nIn total he was capped 34 times by Great Britain.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn 1994 following [[Mal Reilly]]'s decision to step down as both Great Britain and [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] coach to become coach of Australian club the [[Newcastle Knights]], Hanley was appointed coach of the Great Britain Lions during the Ashes series against Australia during the [[1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. His appointment meant he had become the first black person to coach or manage a major national team in Great Britain. After a 12-man Lions team pulled off a gutsy 8-4 win in the first test at Wembley (following the first half send-off of captain [[Shaun Edwards]] for a high tackle), they lost the series when Australia won the second test 34-8 at [[Old Trafford]], and 23-4 at [[Elland Road]] in Leeds.\n\nThe 1994 Ashes series would prove to be Hanley's only time as Great Britain coach. For the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] held in England and Wales, Great Britain was not playing, with [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] competing instead. Also, Hanley had signed with the [[Australian Rugby League]] during the [[Super League war]] which began in 1995 while the RFL were aligned with the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]].<ref name=\"Coach Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org\"/>\n\nIn 1999, he was appointed as the coach of [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] as the successor to [[Shaun McRae]]. In his first season as coach, he led St. Helens to the [[1999 Super League Grand Final]]. His side defeated the [[Bradford Bulls]], the club he began his professional playing career at, by 8\u20136 in October of that year. Whilst he harboured a strong desire to win, he could appear aloof and had several acrimonious disagreements with the St. Helens board of directors, which led to his suspension<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Blackshaw\n|first = Ian Stewart\n|authorlink = \n|title = Mediating sports disputes: national and international perspectives \n|publisher = Cambridge University Press\n|year = 2002\n|location = \n|pages = 86\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0s6hi7mGZ70C&printsec=frontcover\n|doi = \n|isbn = 9789067041461}}</ref> and eventual sacking as the manager of St Helens in 2000. [[Ian Millward]] was appointed as his successor.\n\nHe switched to rugby union coaching and took up posts with [[Bristol Rugby]], and in the England national set-up. He also got involved in the sport of [[Squash (sport)|squash]] before returning to rugby league as a coaching consultant with [[Castleford Tigers]] in 2004. He worked with Cas for just two months before leaving.\n\nOn 14 December 2007 Hanley was unveiled as the coach of National League Two Club [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/7144151.stm|title=BBC SPORT - Rugby League - Hanley appointed Doncaster coach|work=bbc.co.uk|date=14 December 2007}}</ref> He resigned from that r\u00f4le on 28 September 2008, following Doncaster's successful promotion play-off campaign.\n\n==Recognition==\nIn January 1990 he was honoured with an MBE by the Queen for his services to rugby league.

She was the influential favourite of the queen of Scotland, [[Anne of Denmark]]. \n\n==Life==\nHenrietta Stewart was the daughter of [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox ]] and Catherine de Balsac. Henrietta, her sister [[Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar|Marie]] and her brother [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Ludovic]] came back to Scotland from France in 1587.\n\nOn 21 July 1588, Henrietta married [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]], then [[Earl of Huntly]], at [[Holyroodhouse]]. [[James VI of Scotland]] wrote a masque to be performed at the wedding.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/newpoemsbyjamesi00jameiala/page/46 Allan Westcott, ''New poems by James I of England: from a hitherto unpublished manuscript'' (Columbia University Press, 1911), pp. 47\u201352]: Jane Rickard, ''Authorship and Authority in the writings of James VI and I'' (Manchester, 2007), pp. 54-56: Rhodes Dunlap, 'King James's Own Masque', ''Philological Quarterly'', 41 (1962), pp. 249-56.</ref> The wedding celebrations at [[Holyroodhouse]] involving \"plays and masquerades\" lasted two or three days. [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]] gave her a chain of pearls and hair garnishings.<ref>''HMC Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquess of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), pp. 336 no. 691, 341 no. 709.</ref> The king sent requests to lairds, like Murray of [[Abercairny]], for \"venison, wild fowls, fed capons\" for the feast.<ref>''HMC 3rd Report: Moray'' (London, 1872), p. 419.</ref> Before the wedding the couple were made to declare their (Protestant) faith, without which the minister John Craig would not declare the banns.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), pp. 583, 587.</ref>\n\nMarie Stewart became a lady-in-waiting in the household of [[Anne of Denmark]] in December 1590 at Henrietta's request, which increased Henrietta's access at court, and she married the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1558\u20131634)|Earl of Mar]] in December 1592.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 429.</ref> Their younger sister Gabrielle was a nun in France at Glatigny, but a scheme for her to marry Hugh Montgomerie, 5th [[Earl of Eglinton]] in 1598 came to nothing.<ref>''Scots Peerage'' vol. 5 (1908), p. 356: William Fraser, ''Memorials of the Montgomeries Earls of Eglinton'', vol 2 (Edinburgh, 1859), no. 201, now NRS GD3/2/15/10.</ref>\n\nIn February 1593 King James came north to punish and subdue the earls of Huntly, Angus, and Erroll for plotting on behalf of the Catholic faith but they went into hiding. Henrieta and [[Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll]] came to him at Aberdeen and he allowed them to keep their houses and estates.<ref>''Historie and Life of King James the Sext'' (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 268.</ref>\n\nEventually, Henrietta came to be a favourite of the queen, and exerted an influence over her which became controversial.  Henrietta was known to be a fervent Catholic, and the friendship between her and Anne was politically sensitive and developed into a cause for conflict between the king and the queen.  It also brought Queen Anne negative publicity and exposed her to criticism from the Scottish church.  Henrietta Stewart is speculated to have played a part in Queen Anne's rumoured secret Catholic conversion. \n\nHenrietta was able to further her husband's cause at court even when he was forfeited, except in June 1594 when James expressly forbade her attendance. She defied his order and visited Anne of Denmark at [[Holyroodhouse]] in \"base array\", disguised as a servant, on a day when the king had gone to [[Stirling Castle]] to see the building work on the new Chapel Royal.<ref>Grant (2017), p. 71: ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 362\u20133.</ref>\n\nIn 1596 pressure was exerted on her and her husband to convert from Catholicism by taking away her eldest son [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly|Lord Gordon]]. He was to be brought up and court and sent to the [[University of Edinburgh]] as a pupil of [[Robert Rollock]].

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staff.<ref name=\"20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staff.<ref name=\"20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7A]]' strafe it to sink it<ref name=\"A3H\" />. \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nThe 1980s saw VQ-2 continue flying the EP-3E and EA-3B aircraft at a high tempo. The squadron maintained a permanent detachment in Athens, but unlike its sister squadron, VQ-1 who had a permanently assigned Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at its [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi]] detachment, VQ-2 rotated its OIC with the aircrews. Throughout the decade, the squadron regular had detachments at [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig]], [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Keflavik]], [[RAF Machrihanish|Machrihanish]], and [[Naval Air Station Sigonella|Sigonella]]. The squadron also manned detachments on all Sixthfleet carriers until October 1987, when the Navy deemed the A-3 no longer capable of safe, routine carrier operations after multiple mishaps with high loss of life in the active and reserve A-3 community.\n\n\n\nAnother milestone came at the end of the decade when the authorization for women to fly in non-combat.\n\n===Eastern and Central Med Hot Spots===\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall]], [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig]], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7A]]' strafe it to sink it<ref name=\"A3H\" />. \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nThe 1980s saw VQ-2 continue flying the EP-3E and EA-3B aircraft at a high tempo. The squadron maintained a permanent detachment in Athens, but unlike its sister squadron, VQ-1 who had a permanently assigned Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at its [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi]] detachment, VQ-2 rotated its OIC with the aircrews.

The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.
