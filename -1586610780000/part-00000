After a firefight between the Mohawks and local vigilantes, the state government started eviction proceedings. When the federal courts refused to hear the matter, Assistant State Attorney General [[Mario Cuomo]] was dispatched to negotiate a settlement.

When the federal courts refused to hear the matter, Assistant State Attorney General [[Mario Cuomo]] was dispatched to negotiate a settlement.

{"title_page": "List of Judge Dredd characters", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{In-universe|date=October 2009}}\n{{TOC right}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' in the British comic strip '''''[[Judge Dredd]]''''' appearing in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' and related publications. They are listed alphabetically by surname, in categories. (Major characters have their own articles: see the navigation box at [[#References|the bottom of this article]].)\n\n==Judges of Mega-City One==\n{{Main|Judge (2000 AD)}}\n\n===Anderson===\nSee [[Judge Anderson]].\n\n===Beeny===\nBeeny is the child of the two main characters who appeared in the first ''[[America (Judge Dredd story)|America]]'' story, America Jara and Bennett Beeny. She herself first appeared briefly in the sequel to that story, but her first main story was the third in the ''America'' trilogy,<ref>\"Cadet,\" in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #250\u2013252, 2006</ref> in which she took a lead role.\n\nIn 2119 Beeny was enrolled as a cadet in the Academy of Law by her father just before his untimely death,<ref>\"America: Fading of the Light,\" in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #25, 1996</ref> and served well enough to qualify for the accelerated graduation program. In her tenth year, as with all tenth year cadets, she was required to plan and execute a criminal investigation on her own. Allowed to choose her supervisor, she chose to work with Judge Dredd.\n\nIn 2130 she graduated to full judge at age 15. In late 2137 Beeny and Dredd investigated a Total War terrorist cell which had assassinated a member of the Council of Five, [[Mega-City One]]'s highest legislative body. Following the arrest of the perpetrators, Dredd recommended that Beeny be appointed to the vacant Council seat, and [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] agreed.<ref>\"Terror Rising,\" in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #365\u2013367</ref> She was briefly removed from the Council in early 2141, when the entire Council was dismissed by the new chief judge, [[#Logan|Judge Logan]].<ref>\"Machine Law,\" in ''2000 AD'' #2118</ref> However, shortly afterwards Logan acknowledged that this had been a mistake, and he reinstated her.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2122</ref>\n\n===Castillo===\n'''Judge Laverne Castillo'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=CASTILLO Judge Castillo's profile on official ''2000AD '' website]</ref> was a [[Judge (2000 AD)|street judge]] who was taken off street duty when she froze in combat and allowed a fellow judge to be shot and seriously wounded. Transferred to administrative duties, she became the personal aide to Chief Judge McGruder and accompanied the Chief Judge on a diplomatic visit to the planet [[Outer planets of the Solar System in fiction#Comics|Hestia]]. When their spaceship crashed there, Castillo so impressed Judge Dredd that on their return home he recommended that she be transferred back to street duty.<ref>''2000 AD'' #892, 904\u2013914; ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #58\u201369</ref> This time she excelled in her chosen role, and was Dredd's [[sidekick]] in a number of stories until she was murdered in 2123 by aliens after eight years on the force.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #76\u201379</ref>\n\nDuring her time on Hestia, Castillo developed a secret and unrequited crush on Judge Dredd. Writer [[John Wagner]] never developed this theme any further with her character, but this idea was taken up again with the character [[Galen DeMarco]] and used to greater effect, with significant repercussions in the relevant stories.\n\n===Deacon===\n'''Judge Francesco Deacon''' was one of the first ever street judges, in the 2030s. Before becoming a judge he was in the military police.<ref>Carroll, M. (2018) ''Judges: The Avalanche'' [[Abaddon Books]], p. 57</ref> He first appeared in [[Michael Carroll (author)|Michael Carroll]]'s novel ''Judges: The Avalanche'', and simultaneously in the ''Judge Dredd'' comic strip story \"Paradigm Shift\" in ''2000&nbsp;AD'' #2082\u20132086 in May 2018, also written by Carroll and with art by [[Staz Johnson]].\n\n===Dekker===\n'''Judge Dekker'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=2000AD&choice=DEKKER Judge Dekker profile]</ref> first appeared in [[1984 in comics|1984]] as a [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|rookie judge]], being successfully evaluated by Dredd as to her suitability to become a full judge.<ref>''Judge Dredd'' (all by [[John Wagner]]/[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Kim Raymond]]):<br /> \"Super Bowl\" (in ''2000 AD'' #370\u2013371, 1984)<br /> \"Bingo\" (in ''2000 AD'' #372, 1984)<br /> \"The Making of a Judge\" (in ''2000 AD'' #373, 1984)</ref> She did not reappear in the strip again until [[1991 in comics|1991]], when writer [[Garth Ennis]] used her as a recurring secondary character in several 1991 and 1992 strips \u2013 most prominently as the investigating judge against the \"Muzak Killer\".<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"Muzak Killer\" (by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Dermot Power]], in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' #746\u2013748, 1991)</ref> By this time an experienced street judge, she was killed in the [[1992 in comics|1992]] story \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\" (set in 2114). Upon her death Dredd considered that she was ''\"...the best rookie he'd ever had, bar none.\"'' He later hallucinated her during his crucifixion in \"Goodnight Kiss\".\n\nAn alternative, evil version of Dekker from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] appeared in the [[1994 in literature|1994]] novel ''[[Dread Dominion]]''.<ref>''Dread Dominion'' ([[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]], May 1994 {{ISBN|0-352-32929-7}})</ref>\n\n===Dolman===<!-- This section is linked from [[Judge Dredd]] -->\n'''Dolman''' was a cadet at the Academy of Law. He was cloned from Judge Dredd's DNA. Although he performed well at the Academy, he resented his lack of control over his own life and chose to leave the Academy and Mega-City One.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1378\u20131381</ref> He joined the [[Space Corps (Judge Dredd)|Space Corps]] and was transferred to an offworld Academy, though he regularly returned to the city; keeping in touch with [[Vienna Dredd]] and took classes at night school.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' 260: \"Judge Dredd: Night School\"</ref>\n\nShortly after \"[[Day of Chaos]]\", Dolman returned to the city: he felt obliged to help out, especially with his family in danger.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1802\">''2000 AD'' #1802</ref> He was an advisor and non-combatant in the Corps by now, and first arrived in the city when Marines were asked to break the siege at Sue Perkins Block. Colonel Lynn Easter viewed him with mild contempt, especially when he tried to stop her bombing the block, but Dolman used his judge training to cripple a marine, forcing her to call off the airstrike, and then assist Dredd in stopping the siege. (For most of the story Dolman went unnamed, leaving his return a surprise.) He was injured in the process and sent to hospital, with Dredd calling him \"a judge\" over Dolman's protests.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1792\u20131796: \"Judge Dredd: Debris\"</ref> The Corps were left angry that Dolman had shot a marine \u2013 a decision Dredd agreed with \u2013 and Easter and two others assaulted him in hospital, but Dolman was able to take them down.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1802\" />\n===Dredd===\nSee [[Judge Dredd (character)|Judge Dredd]]\n===Fargo===\n'''Chief Judge Eustace Fargo''' was the first chief judge of Mega-City One (and indeed of the entire United States, before it was divided) and the source of the DNA from which Judge Dredd was cloned. In the 1995 film ''Judge Dredd'' Fargo was played by [[Max von Sydow]].\n\nAlmost every appearance of Fargo in the comic has been a flashback, since he was believed to have died in 2051, decades before the stories in the comic. However in 2006\u201307 the story ''[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]'', written by [[John Wagner]], described a [[secret history]] in which Fargo's death had been faked and he had survived in suspended animation until 2129.\n\nAs a result of a massive increase in violent gang crime, US president Thomas Gurney appointed Fargo Special Prosecutor for Street Crime. When the Constitution was amended to allow the creation of an elite law enforcement agency to convict criminals without due process, Fargo was made the first \"chief judge\" in 2031. Fargo resigned and attempted suicide in 2051, but the matter was covered up by deputy chief judges [[#Solomon|Solomon]] and [[#Goodman|Goodman]], who fabricated a story that he had been killed in a drive by shooting. In fact he survived, and was placed in suspended animation until such time as medical science advanced to the point where his injuries could be fully healed. He was succeeded as chief judge by Solomon.\n\nIn 2070, after the Third World War devastated the United States, Fargo was revived, and he advised the chief judge \u2013 now Goodman \u2013 to overthrow [[#President Robert L. Booth|President Bob Booth]] and take over the government, which was done. Fargo survived an assassination attempt by [[#Judd|Morton Judd]], but his condition deteriorated and he was returned to suspended animation. Shortly afterwards he was kidnapped by Judd's men, and was thought lost forever. But in 2129 it was discovered that he was being held by terrorists in the Cursed Earth, and Judge Dredd led a team to rescue him. Fargo was revived, but he was beyond saving and died shortly afterwards.\n\n===Francisco===\n\n'''Judge Dan Francisco''' was chief judge of Mega-City One from 2131 to 2134, except for a brief period when he was deposed by his deputy, [[#Sinfield|Judge Sinfield]], from 2131 to 2132.\n\nBefore becoming chief judge, Francisco was a street judge and the subject of a 24-hour reality show called ''The Streets Of Dan Francisco'' \u2013 a major public relations boost for Justice Department. In 2131 Judges [[#Sinfield]], Cardew and Millan began a campaign to run Francisco as a candidate to replace [[Judge Hershey]] as chief judge, running on an [[Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)|anti-mutant]] platform.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1628</ref> He won by a landslide.\n\n[[Tour of Duty (Judge Dredd story)|Mutant townships]] in the [[Cursed Earth]] were set up, to which to expel the mutant citizens. Francisco also had Hershey and Dredd given new postings, off-world and in the townships respectively, until the mutant issue died down; how much of this was his own idea and how much was Sinfield's remained ambiguous.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1649</ref>\n\nSinfield dosed Francisco with a powerful hypnotic drug, persuaded him to resign,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1666\u20131667 and #2010</ref> and succeeded him as acting chief judge.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1674 and 1677</ref> Both Dredd and the mayor were left confused and suspicious by Francisco's sudden collapse in confidence and by his support of Sinfield. This eventually led to an investigation, and Sinfield's crime was uncovered. Sinfield was arrested, and Francisco returned to office. Francisco appointed Dredd to the Council of Five.\n\nIn 2134 Dredd learned of a terrorist plot to infect Mega-City One with a deadly pathogen. Dredd recommended a ground assault on the terrorist's camp, but Francisco overruled him and ordered an air strike. Consequently the fact that it wasn't the real camp was not discovered until it was too late, and Mega-City One was infected. By the time the disease was contained, 350 million people had been killed (out of an initial population of around 400 million), and Francisco resigned in shame of \"presiding over the [[Day of Chaos|worst disaster in our history]]\". He appointed Judge Hershey as his successor.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1789</ref>\n\n===Gerhart===\n\n'''SJS Judge Alex Gerhart''' was Dredd's interrogator when a Tek-Division scientist was murdered. He used the opportunity to pressure Dredd about whether he felt guilty for [[Day of Chaos|Chaos Day]], knowing it was revenge for his own destruction of East-Meg Two.<ref>Prog 1799: \"Innocence Part 2\"</ref> Gerhart himself did feel Dredd was responsible. When their paths next crossed, he was hospitalised saving Dredd from a missile attack: he intends to one day arrest the man and put him on trial for Chaos Day.<ref>Prog 1836</ref>\n\nIn 2136, Gerhart was sent with Dredd and [[Space Corps (comics)|a marine squad]] to investigate a potential uprising on the Titan penal colony.\n\nIn 2140 he resigned and took the Long Walk.<ref>Progs 2073\u20132074</ref>\n\nGerhart was murdered by insane SJS Judge Pin in 2141 for being a close associate of Dredd.\n\n===Giant===\n'''Judge Giant''' can refer to either of two characters. They are father and son. Their first names have never been given.\n\nThey are both descended from another ''2000 AD'' character, 'Giant' (real name John Clay), who starred in his own series in ''2000 AD'', ''[[Harlem Heroes]],'' which ran in progs (issues) 1\u201327 of the comic. '''John 'Giant' Clay''' made a [[cameo appearance]] in the ''Judge Dredd'' strip in prog 28. Since Judge Dredd himself did not appear in ''2000 AD'' until prog 2, the Giant family's appearance in the comic predates Dredd's debut in his own strip.\n\n====Judge Giant Snr====\nThe original Judge Giant first appeared in prog 27 of the comic ([[1977 in comics|1977]]) as a rookie [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge]] who had just graduated from the Academy of Law. Set in 2099, his first appearance in \"The Academy of Law\" (progs 27\u201328) was a [[2000 AD crossovers|crossover]] with ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', set decades after the events depicted in that series. It featured a cameo appearance by his father, John 'Giant' Clay, as a very old man at the end of the story. \"The Academy of Law\" is also notable for the debut of another important supporting character, [[#Griffin|Judge Griffin]], as well as the Academy of Law itself. It tells of Rookie Giant's [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|Final Assessment]], a gruelling test of his judgement and abilities to determine his suitability for promotion to full judge. His supervisor is Judge Dredd, who passes him.\n\nJudge Giant became Dredd's [[sidekick]] for the next four years. His most important story was the 23-episode [[#Chief Judge Cal|Judge Cal]] storyline, in which he first saved Dredd from being executed and then fought with him against Cal's renegade judges and alien mercenaries (Kleggs) until the end. Although he had an important role in that story, his appearances in later tales were generally little more than mere cameos, and his importance within the strip tailed off somewhat. He was finally killed off in the \"[[Block Mania]]\" story (1981) while trying to arrest [[Orlok the Assassin|Orlok]] just before the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]]. The unheroic circumstances of his death (he was shot in the back in a brief scene) were controversial among fans, since although they were used to seeing popular characters killed off in ''2000 AD'', they were disappointed with the cursory way in which Giant's death was depicted. In an interview years later, writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] said: \"When we wrote the death of Giant, I thought it was a great idea to kill him off in such a casual, natural (for a judge) way. But when the reader outcry came, I was startled and forced to see things from their point of view.\"<ref>[http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant4.shtml Alan Grant interview from January 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516041824/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant4.shtml |date=2006-05-16}}</ref>\n\n====Judge Giant Jnr====\nIn 1989 the story \"Young Giant\"<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"Young Giant\" (by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]], in ''2000 AD'' #651\u2013655, 1989)</ref> established that the original Judge Giant had fathered a child in 2101, something prohibited to judges. Orphaned when his mother was murdered in front of him shortly after the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]] in 2104, Giant's son had been inducted into the Academy of Law, where he performed extremely well but with a worrying streak of violence that threatened his ability as a judge. With Dredd's help, Giant was able to get past his deep-rooted anger and brought his mother's killer to justice.\n\nUnlike his father, who became a full judge in his first story, Cadet Giant remained a cadet for five years during his recurring appearances in the strip. He was a major protagonist in one of Judge Dredd's biggest and most significant epics, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\", even taking over the lead role from Dredd himself in half a dozen episodes (including two in which Dredd did not even appear).<ref>''2000 AD'' #688\u2013693</ref> He led a group of cadets who remained free of Dark Judge control and, at one point, were personally hunted down by [[#Dark Judges|Judge Mortis]]. He would later be one of the first people to battle Sabbat's zombies during [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]. Eventually he became the youngest cadet ever to graduate from the Academy, at the age of fifteen, having been fast-tracked. In a story reminiscent of his father's debut, Giant's Final Assessment was conducted by Judge Dredd, who passed him as fit to become a judge in 2116.<ref>''Judge Dredd:'' \"Giant\" (by John Wagner and Ian Gibson, in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 2 no. 50-52, 1994)</ref>\n\nThe new Judge Giant has made several appearances since, and actually saved the whole world from a deadly virus in 2117.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 2 no. 83</ref> He is apparently one of the best judges in [[Mega-City One]], although he has not featured in any story to the extent that he did in \"Necropolis\".\n\n(In a six-page one-off story in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #216 called \"Whatever Happened to John 'Giant' Clay?\" (2004),<ref>''Whatever Happened To...?'': \"John 'Giant' Clay\", by [[Gordon Rennie]] and [[Rufus Dayglo]], in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #216 (2004) (reprinted in supplement to ''Megazine'' #388).</ref> Judge Giant met his grandfather for the first time. The original Giant had not appeared in any story since 1978, and this story ended with his death from old age.)\n\n===Goodman===\n'''Chief Judge Clarence Goodman''' was Mega-City One's longest serving chief judge, and the first to appear in the comic. He was in the first ever episode of ''Judge Dredd'' in prog 2 (March 1977), although not named until prog 86. He was assassinated in prog 89, but returned in flashbacks in the story ''[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]'' (2006\u201307).\n\nGoodman was deputy chief judge of the United States, first under [[#Fargo|Chief Judge Fargo]] and then under [[#Solomon|Chief Judge Solomon]]. In 2052 each American mega-city ran its own justice department, and Goodman was deputy chief judge of [[Mega-City One]], succeeding Solomon as chief judge in 2058. In 2070, after [[#President Robert L. Booth|President Robert Booth]] started a nuclear war which devastated America, Goodman overthrew the president and Congress and took over the city; the other mega-cities became independent.\n\nThirty years later Goodman was assassinated by Judge Quincy and others, on the orders of his own deputy, [[#Chief Judge Cal|Judge Cal]].\n\n===Greel===\n'''Tek-Judge Todd Greel''' was head of Tek-Division, and he personally took over the [[Mechanismo]] robot judge project after the project's previous heads, Stitch and Quiggley, were disgraced. In 2116 Greel compelled Stich to give evidence against Dredd for having illegally destroyed a Mark II robot to sabotage their field test, which resulted in Dredd being convicted and sent to the penal colony on Titan. Immediately afterwards, Greel was briefly acting chief judge. However he was implicated in an assassination attempt on [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] when one of his Mark IIA robots attempted to kill her and she had to be saved by Dredd while ''en route'' to Titan. Although Greel's alleged guilt was never proved, McGruder curtly demoted him to a junior position in Traffic Control, effectively finishing his political ambitions for ever. The Mechanismo programme was aborted, and Dredd was pardoned.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #57; ''2000 AD'' #891\u2013894; 904\u2013915</ref> Greel was succeeded as head of Tek-Division by Judge McGovern and then [[#McTighe|Judge McTighe]].<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #40, 52\u201355</ref> Greel later appeared in ''[[The Pit (Judge Dredd story)|The Pit]]'', running Traffic Station Alamo in the North-West Habzone: enforcing petty restrictions on other judges, his only remaining power.\n\n===Griffin===\n'''Judge J\u00fcrgen Griffin''' first appeared in prog 27 in a story by John Wagner and Ian Gibson. He was Principal of the Academy of Law, and had taught Dredd when he was a cadet. When the insane [[#Chief Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]] seized control of Mega-City One, Griffin and other Academy tutors joined Dredd's resistance movement. Griffin was one of only two of these tutors who was still alive by the time Cal was overthrown; the other was [[#Pepper|Judge-Tutor Pepper]]. Dredd declined to succeed Cal as chief judge and nominated Griffin for the office. Griffin was elected chief judge by acclamation, and appointed Pepper as deputy chief judge.\n\nGriffin was captured by the enemy during the [[Apocalypse War]] in 2104, and brainwashed into supporting their propaganda campaign. Dredd judged it impossible to rescue him, and so he assassinated him instead, during a live television broadcast.\n\n===Herriman===\n'''Deputy Chief Judge Paul Herriman''' was originally a [[Judge (2000 AD)|street judge]] and had worked in every major division of Justice Department. He saw himself as a conciliator, preferring to operate by consensus.<ref>Prog 916: \"The Candidates Part 1\"</ref> In 2116, he was one of the senior judges who tried to pressure [[Chief Judge McGruder|Judge McGruder]] into reinstating the Council of Five, in order to have the power to remove her.\n\nAfter McGruder stood down, Herriman was one of the candidates in the election to replace her. Running against Judges Dredd, [[#Volt|Volt]] and [[Judge Hershey|Hershey]], Herriman came third. Chief Judge Volt appointed Herriman deputy chief judge. In 2117 Herriman became the first deputy chief judge to regularly preside over meetings of the ruling Council of Five following Volt's decision to abolish the chief judge's ''ex officio'' chairmanship of the Council.\n\nHerriman was assassinated by [[#Dark Judges|Judge Mortis]] in 2120 while he was acting chief judge and his corpse was used as Mortis's vessel. He was succeeded as deputy chief judge by [[Judge Hershey]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #915\u2013918; ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #52\u201355; ''Batman vs. Judge Dredd: Die Laughing'' graphic novel (1998)</ref>\n\n===Hershey===\n'''Judge Barbara Hershey''' first appeared in ''[[The Judge Child]]'' in 1980, in an episode written by [[John Wagner]] and drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. For nearly two decades she regularly appeared as Dredd's junior colleague, before being promoted to become his superior in 1999; she was chief judge twice. She also had her own solo series, ''Judge Hershey'', in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' (1992\u20131997).<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=hershey Judge Hershey] at 2000 AD online</ref> In the 1995 film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', Hershey is played by [[Diane Lane]].\n\nShortly after her graduation from the Academy of Law in 2102 at age eighteen,<ref>''2000 AD'' #162; 1178</ref> [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]] Hershey joined the crew of the spaceship ''Justice 1'' for the dangerous deep-space mission to find the [[Judge Child]], who had been abducted by the Angel Gang. Two years later, during the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]], Hershey was called upon again by Judge Dredd to join his \"Apocalypse Squad\" for a daring commando raid which ended the war.<ref>''2000 AD'' #263\u2013270</ref>\n\nWhen [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] resigned her position in 2108, she appointed  Hershey as the youngest ever member of the Council of Five, Mega-City One's highest legislative body.<ref>''2000 AD'' #457</ref> Her meteoric rise up the Justice Department's \"greasy pole\" saw her hotly tipped to become chief judge in due course, but she denied any real ambitions in this direction.<ref name=\"Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 2 #53\">''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #53</ref> Even so, she soon experienced the power that goes with the office when she was asked to serve as acting chief judge while McGruder \u2013 back for an unprecedented second term of office \u2013 attended a crisis meeting of judges from all over the world to find a way to defeat [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Sabbat the Necromagus]] in 2114.<ref>''2000 AD'' #792</ref> Her sister Hillary, a civilian, was killed by Sabbat's zombies, leaving her son Anton, Barbara's nephew, an orphan. The following year, when Anton was kidnapped, Hershey rescued him.<ref>\"The Harlequin's Dance\", in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #37\u201340, 1993</ref>\n\nWhen McGruder resigned for the second time, in 2116, Hershey was one of the candidates to replace her, but she received only 13 votes from the 400 senior judges who voted. [[#Volt|Chief Judge Volt]] appointee her to the new Council of Five, and in 2120 she became deputy chief judge. The following year she became acting chief judge following the suicide of Volt at the end of the [[The Doomsday Scenario|Second Robot War]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #1167</ref> In 2122 she was elected chief judge in her own right, trouncing the only other candidate, Judge Loblaw.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1178</ref>\n\nIn 2130 she repealed the [[Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)|anti-mutant laws]] (largely at Dredd's insistence), making her unpopular with the public and many judges.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2008 and 1569\u201375</ref> In the following year senior judges began a campaign to have her voted out of office and replaced with a hardline candidate who would reinstate those laws.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1628</ref> [[#Francisco|Judge Dan Francisco]] won the election by a landslide,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1633</ref> and appointed Hershey to a position on another planet.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1649</ref> At over nine years, Hershey had the longest reign (2122\u20132131) of any chief judge since [[#Goodman|Clarence Goodman]], and the longest since the comic strip began in 1977. Dredd described her as \"the best chief judge we've ever had.\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #1632</ref>\n\nAfter two years away from Earth, Hershey returned to Mega-City One and resumed her old role as a street judge. In the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]'', set in 2134, a deadly plague wiped out seven eighths of the city's population. Francisco resigned and appointed Hershey to form an interim government.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1789</ref>\n\nIn 2139 Hershey reintroduced the Mechanismo robot judges, the failure of which had ended Chief Judge McGruder's career 23 years earlier. Her efforts to win Dredd over failed.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2024\u20132029</ref>\n\nIn 2141 Hershey decided to step down for a second time, and nominated [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Logan|Judge Logan]] as her successor.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2115</ref> Publicly she retired due to desire to move on from the top post, but in private she had concealed a terminal illness contracted during her time off world and had managed to hide it from all but her doctors.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2119</ref> Hershey was the third longest serving chief judge (after [[Chief Judge Fargo|Fargo]] and [[Judge Goodman|Goodman]]), having held office for a total of sixteen years.\n\nSeveral months later, with no signs of improvement, Hershey asked to be euthanized.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2150</ref> This story, \"Guatemala,\" was published in September 2019, 39 years after the character's first appearance. In later episodes of the same story, it was revealed that Hershey had had another sister (not named in the story), who lived in [[Guatemala]]. As this sister was unable to have children, Hershey had donated her eggs, and so the resulting child and grandchildren were genetically Judge Hershey's own. Years later, Guatemala was taken over in a coup and Hershey's sister was murdered. Hershey's last request to Dredd was for him to go there and rescue her surviving relatives from danger.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2154 and 2157</ref> Dredd later infiltrated Guatemala under the guise of a diplomatic mission, located the family and was able to rescue Hershey's daughter, granddaughter and unborn great granddaughter; however her grandson was killed in the operation. The family were returned to Mega-City One to live under Justice Department protection.\n\nHershey's death was not as it seemed however and was in fact faked. Hershey believed she had been poisoned by her enemies and that a cure existed somewhere. She faked her death in order to retire and leave the city to hunt down the agents of former black ops chief [[#Smiley|Judge Smiley]] who she believed was responsible for her illness and held the cure.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2175</ref>\n\n===Janus===\n'''Judge Judy Janus''' is a member of Psi Division, Justice Department's unit of judges with psionic powers. She is portrayed as a young and ditzy [[psychic]] (she is a [[Precognition|precog]] and [[Telepathy|telepath]]). The character was created by [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] and first appeared in prog 842 in the story ''Inferno'' (1993). She later appeared in her own [[eponym]]ous strip, ''Janus: Psi Division'' (1993\u20131997),<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=2000AD&choice=JANUS List of Judge Janus stories] at Barney</ref> and in [[Dave Stone]]'s 1995 novel ''[[Wetworks (Judge Dredd novel)|Wetworks]]''.<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=Specials&choice=JANUS Barney]</ref>\n\n===Lamia===\n'''Exorcist-Judge Miryam Lamia''' was killed in action and then returned from the dead in circumstances that have not been explained. This experience left her with the unwanted ability to see and speak with the ghosts of the dead, and bizarre patterned markings on her body. Although communicating with the dead initially helped her to solve cases, she became unable to cope with constantly seeing ghosts, as there were so many of them, and she became a recluse, spending most of her time secluded in a room which the dead could not enter. She first appeared in prog 1640.<ref>''2000AD'' progs 1640\u20131643; 2069</ref>\n\n===Logan===\n\n'''Judge Logan''' is chief judge of [[Mega-City One]] (as of December 2019).\n\nLogan first appeared as Dredd's assistant in the 2003 story \"The Satanist,\" a role he held for nine years. During this period he appeared in the \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#Total War|Total War]]\" storyline (2004) and in \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" (2006\u201307). In \"Origins\" he was severely wounded in action and required major surgery, including an artificial lung, arm and spleen.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1535 and 1542, 2007</ref> In \"[[Tour of Duty (Judge Dredd story)|Tour of Duty]]\" (2009\u201310) he was promoted to senior judge.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1689</ref> Shortly afterwards he personally discovered the evidence which resulted in [[#Sinfield|Chief Judge Sinfield's]] conviction and removal from office in 2132.<ref>''2000'' AD #1693</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Day of Chaos]]\" (2011\u201312) he again lost his arm in an encounter with [[Dark Judges|Judge Mortis]] and was hospitalised.<ref>''2000'' AD #1782\u201383</ref> He received a prosthetic arm.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2116</ref>\n\nLogan was not seen again (except in a cameo) until \"Machine Law\" in 2019, in which it was revealed that he had become the sector house chief in Sector 6 in 2139.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2115</ref> In that same story, set in 2141, he succeeded [[Judge Hershey]] as Chief Judge, with Dredd's endorsement. He immediately appointed a [[Mechanismo|robot judge]] to the Council of Five, Mega-City One's ruling body, causing Dredd to have misgivings about him.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2118</ref> However, he eventually realised he had tried to go too far too soon.\n\n===Maitland===\n\n'''Judge Maitland''' is a judge working for Accounts. She first appeared in \"The Bean Counter\" (prog 1790), the first strip after ''[[Day of Chaos]]'', where she had a 'meeting' with Dredd in the middle of a riot because he would not come to her office. A highly lethal combatant, in mid-battle she berated Dredd for his contempt towards divisions like Accounts and his lack of paperwork, pointing out the necessity of \"bean counters\" like her to keep Justice Department functioning.\n\nIn \"[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|The Cold Deck]],\" she reported to Chief Judge Hershey about the city's crippled finances and advised nationalising the banks that had collapsed, then reclaiming their capital retroactively. Unknown to either of them, she was part of Dredd and Judge Smiley's team investigating Judge Bachmann: after tracking Black Ops' funds to Overdrive Inc, she was mindwiped so that Bachmann would not find out that he had recruited her. Her memory was returned when Black Ops' coup started, as Bachmann's office was right next to Accounts; she was able to rescue a wounded Dredd, patch him up, and hold off Black Ops agents until help arrived. After the coup was stopped, Dredd apologised for doubting her work in Accounts.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1809\u20131812</ref> She was subsequently promoted to head of Accounts Division, as the previous head (and \"72.342%\" of the division) had been killed in Bachmann's coup.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #336</ref>\n\n===McGruder===\n\n'''Chief Judge Hilda Margaret McGruder''' was chief judge of Mega-City One from 2104 to 2108 and again from 2112 to 2116.\n\nAfter the death of the insane [[#Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], McGruder was appointed to eliminate corruption from the discredited Special Judicial Squad. She was head of the SJS from 2101 to 2104.<ref>''2000 AD'' #182; 270</ref>\n\nShe led the resistance to the invading forces during the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]] after [[#Griffin|Chief Judge Griffin]] was killed and Judge Dredd was taken prisoner. As the only surviving member of the Council of Five after the war, she became chief judge by default.<ref>''2000 AD'' #270</ref> In her first term she established herself as one of the city's most able rulers as she set about rebuilding the war-torn city.<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\">''2000 AD'' #457</ref>\n\nShe resigned after four years in office, blaming herself for a massacre she thought she could have prevented (although most of her colleagues were more forgiving and begged her to stay), and took [[the Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|the Long Walk]] into the [[Cursed Earth]]. (Her final act in office was to dismiss all of the senior judges who disagreed with her decision to resign, saying this proved they had poor judgement.) She was succeeded as chief judge by [[#Silver|Thomas Silver]].<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\" />\n\nHer years in the Cursed Earth had had a damaging effect on her mental health, leaving her with a volatile temper, cruder mannerisms, and multiple personality syndrome as she began referring to herself using the [[royal we]] and arguing with herself.<ref name=\"2000 AD #706\">''2000 AD'' #706</ref> She ran into Dredd during the [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]] crisis and returned with him to fight the [[Dark Judges]]. With Silver missing and presumed dead, she subsequently returned to the office of chief judge.<ref>''2000 AD'' #699</ref>\n\nHer first task was to once more get the city and Judge force back on their feet, as well as to deal with all the dead. She decided not to appoint a Council of Five, but instead take advice from any and all Senior Judges when the time came; in an early such discussion, on Dredd's advice, she agreed to a public referendum over whether the Judges should continue to rule the city.\n\nHer second term became increasingly beset with doubts about the quality of her leadership and her sanity. To cover up the losses of Judges from the recent crises, she began a programme of [[Mechanismo|robot judges]] which went disastrously wrong. However, she kept trying to revive the Mechanismo project despite clear evidence it was unworkable, and without a formal body like the Council of Five there was no way to oppose her if she would not listen to advice. In 2116 a deputation of senior judges, including Dredd, attempted to persuade her to reform the Council (with a view to then removing her from office), but they were unsuccessful, partly as she realised they would try to do away with her.<ref>''2000 AD'' #891</ref>\n\nHer final attempt to revive Mechanismo caused the robots themselves to try and assassinate her. By this point, Dredd was under arrest for his unlawful attempts to stop the project and McGruder's growing madness had embarrassed her on a tour of the colony world Hestia. When the assassination attempt was uncovered, and when Dredd was the sole reason she (and others) survived it, she pardoned him, scrapped the project, and agreed to stand down from office.<ref>''2000 AD'' #915</ref> She was succeeded by [[#Volt|Judge Volt]].\n\nDeclining to take the Long Walk again, she became a civilian and decided to write her memoirs. In her retirement she developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and her mental health rapidly deteriorated even further.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 3 #9</ref> When Judge Dredd heard that she had been scheduled for compulsory [[euthanasia]] he abducted her and led her to a more honourable death fighting criminals in the Cursed Earth.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1009</ref> The facts of her death were covered up.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1167</ref>\n\nA Mega-City One battleship and a street were named after her in her honour.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1033; 1504</ref>\n\n===McTighe===\n'''Tek-Judge McTighe''' was head of Tek Division. He is the longest-serving head of Tek-Division to appear in the comic, as that office usually tends to have a high rate of turnover. He succeeded Judge McGovern in 2120, and joined the [[Council of Five]] shortly afterwards, following the death of [[#Herriman|Judge Herriman]].<ref>''Megazine'' vol. 3 #40, 52\u201355</ref> During the mutant rights vote, Dredd said McTighe was a \"yes man\" who would vote the way Chief Judge Hershey told him.<ref>''2000 AD'' Prog 2008</ref>\n\nHe resigned from the Council in 2131, following the deposing of Hershey;<ref name=\"2000 AD #1649\">''2000 AD'' #1649 </ref> he was not invited back when Niles and Buell were.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1700</ref> He remained in charge of Tek Division. Following the events of Chaos Day, McTighe was left despondent, believing they had failed to protect the citizens.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1798</ref>\n\nHe was assassinated in ''2000 AD'' #1940 (2015), in a story set in 2137. It was revealed in #1943 that he had been re-appointed to the Council of Five at some point since the events in the story ''Trifecta''.\n\n===Morphy===\n'''Judge Morphy''' was the senior judge who supervised Dredd's [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|Final Assessment]] to become a full judge, when Dredd was a [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|rookie]] in 2079. During most of Dredd's career he mentored him, giving advice when needed, and was in many ways a father figure to him. He was killed in the line of duty in 2112, only a few months short of retirement. Dredd took his death very badly and almost murdered one of the killers, restraining himself only at the very last moment. The perpetrators were sentenced to thirty years.<ref>''2000 AD'' #387, 662\u2013668, 775</ref>\n\nA recurring joke in the series is that Dredd always wears the wrong sized boots. This can actually be traced to Morphy's first appearance,<ref>''2000 AD'' #387</ref> where Dredd confided to his former supervisor that he'd been experiencing doubts about the job. Morphy advised him to requisition a pair of boots two sizes too small: \"You'll be so busy cussin' those damned boots you won't have time to worry about anything else.\"\n\n===Niles===\n\nNiles was head of the Special Judicial Squad (internal affairs) until 2122, when [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] made him head of the Public Surveillance Unit. [[#Sinfield|Chief Judge Sinfield]] briefly replaced him as head of PSU with Judge Benedetto; Niles was reinstated by Chief Judge Francisco. When Judge Dredd ran against Sinfield in an election, Niles was Dredd's campaign manager. Niles was killed when the Statue of Judgement, which contained PSU headquarters, was destroyed by terrorists in 2134, after 22 years in the comic.\n\n===Nixon===\n'''Judge Aimee Nixon''' was a corrupt undercover judge. She was eventually arrested and sentenced to 20 years on the Titan penal colony. She was the original lead character in the series ''[[Low Life (comics)|Low Life]]'', until that position was taken by [[Dirty Frank (comics)|Dirty Frank]] and she became a supporting character.\n\n===Oldham===\n\n'''Judge Oldham''' was a street judge and irritant for Dredd in several Al Ewing strips. He was a bullying, reactionary judge with a streak of incompetence. In his first appearance he wanted to break a siege with extreme force despite the risk to hostages.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1611</ref> Then, when part of the security at the World Sex Championships, he shirked his duties to bully the competitors claiming he was \"keeping the deviants in line\", and allowed a gunman in.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1636</ref> Oldham and Dredd do not like each other. In his first appearance, Oldham implied Dredd was being \"soft\" due his mutant sympathies.\n\nDredd recommended that Oldham be moved to meat-wagon duties. Instead, Oldham was made a Senior Judge under [[Judge Sinfield]] and given authority over the older Judge Giant, as a rebuke to Dredd's old ally. During this time, he shot an unarmed mutant and showed no concern.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #292</ref> When Sinfield was deposed, Giant became the dominant partner and tried to turn Oldham around. Despite some progress, Oldham made some basic mistakes in an operation and was shot dead by an escaped killer.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1720\u201321 and 1723</ref>\n\n===Omar===\n'''Psi-Judge Omar''' became head of [[Psi Division]] after his predecessor Ecks was killed in the [[Apocalypse War]]. He personally assisted Judge Dredd in his investigation into the haunting of a sector house,<ref>''2000 AD'' #359\u2013363</ref> and later he exonerated [[Judge Anderson]] when she was accused of negligently permitting the [[Dark Judges]] to escape and threaten the city.<ref>''2000 AD'' #427</ref> When psi-criminal Shojun the Warlord unleashed the demonic Seven Samurai on the city, Omar volunteered to sacrifice his own life in a suicide attack to destroy them using a psionic amplifier.<ref>''2000 AD'' #455</ref> He was succeeded as head of Psi-Division by [[Judge Shenker]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #457</ref>\n\n===Pepper===\n'''Judge Pepper''' was deputy chief judge from 2101 to 2103, succeeding DCJ [[#Grampus|Grampus]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #108, 201</ref>\n\nAfter losing a leg in the 21st century he retired from active service and became a tutor at the Academy of Law, where he taught many of the city's most important and senior judges while they were cadets, including teaching Applied Leadership to both [[Judge Dredd]] and future chief judge [[#Cal|Cal]]. When Chief Judge Cal became insane Pepper volunteered to fight with Dredd to depose the tyrant. In the moment of victory Dredd was offered the position of chief judge, but he declined in favour of [[#Griffin|Judge Griffin]]. Griffin then appointed Pepper as his deputy.<ref>''2000 AD'' #89\u2013108</ref>\n\nTwo years later Pepper was assassinated by game show contestants from a [[reality television]] show, in which contestants gained points by confessing to crimes they had not yet been caught for. Pepper's death led to the show being taken off the air.<ref>''2000 AD'' #201</ref> An artist oversight in this story saw him die with the full complement of two legs.\n\n===Perrier===\n'''Judge Perrier''' first appeared in the story \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", fighting the Sovs at the frontline. She did not appear again until years later when writer Garth Ennis took over the strip and brought her back in \"A Clockwork Pineapple\". She was then killed off in \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", swarmed by zombies before she could reach the city.\n\n===Pin===\n'''SJS Judge Bela Pin''' was an elderly judge who after suffering a mental breakdown on Chaos Day began to murder judges who fail to meet up to her exacting standards, but who she is unable to punish through official channels. Blaming Dredd for the state of the city after Chaos Day she began a vindictive vendetta against him and his closest allies. She killed Judge Gerhart and seriously injured Dredd and Judge Maitland before Dredd was able to knock her into an open burial pit where she was eaten by rats.\n\n===Prager===\n'''Judge Prager''' is one of the judges who chose to take the [[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]] into the [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)|Undercity]] rather than the Cursed Earth. After four years he made his first appearance in prog 328, when he saved Judge Dredd who had been transformed into a werewolf.<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"[[Undercity (Judge Dredd)#Cry of the Werewolf|Cry of the Werewolf]]\" (by [[John Wagner]]/[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Steve Dillon]], in ''2000 AD'' #322\u2013328, 1983)</ref> He next appeared decades later to warn the judges of a new threat to the city from [[#Mr Bones|Bones]], but at the same time reveals he has been infected and transforms into a werewolf at each full moon. Declining the cure and in his wolf form, he helped Dredd defeat Bones' army and resumed his Undercity patrol.<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"[[Undercity (Judge Dredd)#Out of the Undercity|Out of the Undercity]]\" (by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carl Critchlow]], in ''2000 AD'' #1313\u20131316, 2003)</ref>\n\n===Ramos===\n'''Judge Hoolio Ramos''' was head of Street Division on the [[Council of Five]] under [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]]. In 2130 he was sent to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in disgrace after Dredd uncovered crimes he had committed thirty years before, when he was part of a group of [[vigilante]] judges who had taken it upon themselves to execute criminals that the law could not legitimately touch. The truth about these crimes was suppressed, and the public told that Ramos was simply being moved to a new posting off-world.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1589\u20131595</ref>\n\n===Renga===\n\nOne of the four cadets involved in the \"[[The Hunting Party (Judge Dredd story)|Hunting Party]]\" storyline,<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=reprint&page=gnprofiles&choice=hunting Details of the ''Hunting Party'' trade paperback], ''2000 AD'' #1033\u20131049</ref> '''Renga''' had briefly worked undercover in a juve gang for [[Wally Squad]]; the experiences left him disgruntled and antisocial as well as sporting a gang tattoo (which was later removed). His attitude caused him to clash with Dredd while on a mission to locate the source of [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Dr. Bolt|Dr. Bolt's]] Dune Sharks. After a disastrous attempt to 'save' a Cursed Earth girl from a ritual (which meant the end of her community), it appeared that he was going to be expelled from the Academy. However, he distinguished himself when he was part of a group of Judges that was temporarily thrown back in time to Erie, Indiana during the start of the [[Atomic Wars]], as well as in the final clash against the Dune Sharks, and so Dredd gave him a second chance.\n\nAfter he graduated from the Academy, he was personally chosen by Dredd to assist in the Fargo mission in \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]].\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #1505</ref> He also appeared in the story \"The Scorpion Dance\".<ref>[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=reprint&page=gnprofiles&choice=scorpion Details of ''The Scorpion Dance'' trade paperback]</ref>\n\n===Rico===\n{{confused|Rico Dredd}}\n'''Rico''' is a street judge cloned from the same DNA as Dredd. Since Judges [[Judge Dredd (character)|Joe Dredd]] and Rico Dredd were cloned from the DNA of [[#Fargo|Chief Judge Fargo]] in 2066, at least eight further clones of the Fargo bloodline have been produced by the [[Mega-City One]] [[Judge (2000 AD)|Justice Department]].<ref>\"Sector House,\" ''2000 AD'' #1216</ref> The first of these to graduate from the Academy of Law was given his final street assessment by Joe Dredd in 2122. His original name was Dredd, so to avoid complication at dispatch, on receiving his [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|full eagle]] the clone took the surname Rico, in honour of the late Rico Dredd.<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" episode 3, ''2000 AD'' #1188</ref> He has no first name.<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" episode 1, ''2000 AD'' #1186</ref> During his first five years as a cadet, he had been in the Texas City academy of law, before returning to Mega-City One.\n\nAfter a short period with the traffic division, Rico was assigned to Sector 108, where he overcame his colleagues' resentment at his ancestry and hardline attitude, and proved himself to be a brave and resourceful judge.<ref>\"Sector House,\" ''2000 AD'' #1215\u20131222</ref> He has a strong bond with his clone brother Joe Dredd (although Dredd is old enough to be his father), and when the older man's living quarters were moved to the Grand Hall of Justice, Rico took over his apartment in Rowdy Yates Block.<ref>\"Leaving Rowdy,\" ''2000 AD'' #1280</ref>\n\nWhile serving in Sector 108 Rico had to have one of his lungs replaced with an artificial one following an injury in the line of duty.<ref>\"Sector House,\" ''2000 AD'' #1222</ref> Later he suffered a gunshot wound to the jaw, but has since had this replaced with a synthetic copy.<ref>\"Blood Trails,\" ''2000 AD'' #1440\u20131449</ref>\n\nWhen Mega-City One's [[Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)|mutant]] citizens were exiled to townships in the [[Cursed Earth]], Rico was one of the judges sent to supervise them, under Dredd's command. When Dredd returned to the city he left Rico in charge.<ref>\"[[Tour of Duty (Judge Dredd story)|Tour of Duty]],\" ''2000 AD'' #1656 and #1690</ref> Rico led a contingent of mutant volunteers back to the city to help rebuild it following the disastrous events of the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]''.<ref>\"Day of Chaos,\" ''2000 AD'' #1789</ref><ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=RICO Judge Rico's ''2000 AD'' website profile]</ref>\n\n===Roffman===\n'''Judge Roffman'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=ROFFMAN Judge Roffman's profile]</ref> works in the Public Surveillance Unit. He originally served in the SJS in Sector 301, but was transferred to Street Division in Sector 303 after bugging his superior officer's office. Due to his inexperience he bungled a raid and inadvertently discharged his weapon, shooting and wounding another judge. Suspended from duty, his efforts to make amends (again by spying on his new commanding officer) backfired and almost resulted in the end of his career.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1101\u20131110</ref> Instead [[Judge Edgar]], head of PSU, recognised that his suspicious and devious character made him ideally suited to surveillance work, and she recruited him.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1125</ref>\n\nHe flourished in his new role, and continues to assist Judge Dredd in investigations, including tracking a possible rogue judge in ''Sector House'' and carrying out spy work in ''Lawcon''. He was also forcibly teamed up with [[Galen DeMarco]] during [[The Doomsday Scenario|the Second Robot War]], showing cowardice and amorality much to Galen's disgust. These flaws would later save the day at Lawcon, which was undergoing infiltration by [[shape-shifting]] genocidal aliens: when the infiltrators tried to draw him into a trap by calling for help, Roffman (unlike other law enforcers) simply ignored them, leaving him free and able to help expose the infiltration to Dredd later.\n\nHe distinguished himself years later in the search for the members of the [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#Total War|Total War]] terrorism organisation when they began detonating nuclear bombs around the city.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1408\u20131419</ref> Most of his appearances since then have shown him working remotely from PSU.\n\nRoffman was severely injured in 2134 when his office in PSU headquarters was destroyed during the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]'' (2012),<ref>''2000 AD'' #1775</ref> losing both his legs and his sphincter, which required artificial and clone-grown replacements. Dredd was quietly angry that Roffman had been moved to the head of the queue when hundreds of other judges were allowed to rot in hospital. Despite his feelings, in ''[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|The Cold Deck]]'' he turned to Roffman for help in finding stolen Justice Department data, without telling him what it was. Roffman was left horrified when he learnt it was a gold clearance file and that Dredd had failed to stop it being transferred,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1807</ref> and after he discovered the file contained a list of undercover judges, he reported it to Bachmann as it was \"too big\" to leave to Dredd.\n\n===Sanchez===\n'''Judge Sanchez''' was a newly graduated Judge when [[#Mr Bones|Mr. Bones]] released the [[Judge Dredd vs. Aliens|Incubus]] on Mega-City One. She fought alongside Dredd and Judge Giant in the defence of the Grand Hall of Justice but it appeared the strain would break her. However, the various perils (including being impregnated by the Incubus) helped mould her into a strong judge. Consequently, she was chosen as one of the team assisting Dredd in his mission to rescue Chief Judge Fargo from his kidnappers in the Cursed Earth (in the story \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\"). She states during this time that she is not sure she agrees with the Justice Department's policy of celibacy for Judges.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Shenker===\n'''Judge Shenker''' became head of Psi Division in 2108, and was at the same time appointed to the Council of Five by outgoing [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]]. In 2122 he was dismissed from the Council by [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] because of the disappointing performance of his division, but he remains head of the division to this day.\n\n===Silver===\n\n'''Judge Thomas Silver''' was chief judge of Mega-City One between 2108 and 2112.\n\nHe began his career as a [[judge (2000 AD)|street judge]], serving during the Atomic War and the Second American Civil War. To his later shame, in the early 2070s he was one of the many judges who agreed with [[Morton Judd]]'s ideas of genetically altering the citizens to be more docile.<ref>''2000 AD'' # 560: \"Oz Part 15\"</ref> In 2096 he was wounded in action and compelled to retire from active service. He became principal lecturer in Applied Violence at the Academy of Law.<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\">''2000 AD'' #457</ref>\n\nIn 2108 [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] resigned and left the city on the [[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]. One of her final acts as chief judge was to appoint Silver to the Council of Five, the city's highest [[legislature]]. The Council unanimously chose Silver for the highest office.<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\" />\n\nSilver quickly proved to be the most right-wing, hardline chief judge the city had ever seen. In 2109 he ordered a crack-down on the [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)|Democracy movement]] (a loose affiliation of organisations dedicated to democratic reform ever since the Justice Department usurped the elected government of the United States in 2070), putting Judge Dredd in personal charge of a secret campaign to smear the protest groups' leaders and to sabotage their efforts at peaceful demonstration. Undercover judges placed among the protesters turned a peaceful protest march into a violent riot, giving Dredd the excuse he needed to attack the march with riot squads and make mass arrests. Silver used the ensuing massacre as an example of the dangers of democracy and the need for the iron rule of the judges. Armed with this excuse to tighten control, he took every opportunity to do so.<ref>''2000 AD'' #531\u2013533</ref>\n\nDredd's own responsibility for the deaths at the march, and the corrupt way in which the law had been enforced fed his doubts about the integrity of the system to which he had belonged since birth. When in 2112 a young boy was brutally murdered by a man who had been brain-damaged by a judge during the Democratic March, Dredd's reservations came to a head and he tendered his resignation and took the Long Walk himself.<ref>''2000 AD'' #661 and 668</ref> Silver reacted by ordering a news blackout on Dredd's resignation, and covered it up by going so far as to replace Dredd with an imposter, [[#Kraken|Judge Kraken]], a [[cloning|clone]] from the same DNA as Dredd.<ref>''2000 AD'' #668\u2013671</ref> Silver believed that Dredd had become such an important figure of law-enforcement in the public mind that his departure, if it became known, would incite an intolerable increase in crime.\n\nSilver's judgement proved to be fatal, as only weeks later Kraken's loyalty was turned against the city, precipitating a catastrophe which resulted in the whole city falling under enemy occupation with the loss of 60 million lives. (''See main article [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]].'') Silver despaired recovering the situation and fled the command centre in Mega-City One's darkest hour of need. He attempted to commit suicide but botched the job, and was captured alive. He was murdered by Judge Death and then reanimated as a [[zombie]], but with all his mental faculties intact so that he could be tormented endlessly while his city was systematically extinguished of all life.<ref>''2000 AD'' #700\u2013701</ref>\n\nSo ended Silver's life, but not his undeath. When Dredd returned to rescue his city, Silver again fled and hid, fearing that in his [[undead]] state he would be summarily destroyed by the survivors of the disaster. Only when several months had passed did he dare to return to the city. On arriving once more in his Grand Hall of Justice in 2113, he discovered that in his absence his predecessor, McGruder, had reclaimed her office. He challenged her right to be chief judge, pointing out that she had resigned as chief judge whereas he had not. McGruder retorted that Silver was medically dead. However, since McGruder had dissolved the Council of Five there was no recognised authority with the power to decide the issue. The constitutional crisis was finally resolved when both litigants agreed to abide by Judge Dredd's verdict. Dredd actually ruled in Silver's favour, but then convicted him of gross dereliction of duty for deserting his command in time of war. Dredd executed Silver and McGruder became chief judge by default. Silver's incinerated remains were unceremoniously swept away by a cleaner, a truly ignoble end for a head of state.<ref>''2000 AD'' #733\u2013735</ref> Silver's ghost haunts the Grand Hall of Justice.<ref>''2000 AD'' #735</ref>\n\n===Smiley===\n'''Judge Smiley''' was appointed head of a special \"[[black operations]]\" unit by Chief Judge Griffin in 2101, after Judge Cal's reign of terror. His role was to work in the background as \"a judge to judge the judges who judge the judges,\" to protect the city from a future ''coup d'etat'' by another corrupt judge like Cal.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1812\">''2000 AD'' #1812</ref> One of his missions drove [[Dirty Frank (comics)|Judge Frank]] insane; Smiley arranged for him to be transferred to Wally Squad.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1809</ref> He was also responsible for gathering a squad of rogue ex-judges for various operations,<ref>Judge Dredd Megazine #239</ref> including agent Miss Anne Thrope: she was used to manipulate undercover judge [[Jack Point]] into working for Smiley, and tried to explicitly recruit him as an agent.\n\nAfter the \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd)|Judgement Day]]\" conflict in 2114, Smiley disappeared and was presumed dead, [[Judge Bachmann]] duly replacing him as head of his unit. Smiley had actually moved into a secret psi-shielded office hidden in the Grand Hall of Justice, where he remained out of sight for 20 years, covertly monitoring the Justice Department and waiting until he was needed, although he mentions to Hershey that he has influenced many events in the city since his disappearance. Eventually the threat he had been preparing for turned out to be Bachmann herself, who in 2134 plotted to seize control of the city. Smiley recruited a team of judges to investigate her \u2013 a team so secretive that to prevent their discovery Smiley suppressed their memories of his existence and their objectives, using a post-hypnotic command to reawaken them when needed. They succeeded in defeating Bachmann, who was killed by Smiley himself. Both Hershey and Frank were angered by Smiley's tactics: Hershey because Smiley could have brought her on board at any time and deliberately left her out of the loop, and Frank because Smiley had deliberately let hundreds of people die in order to force Bachmann into the open. Hershey openly suggested that they had \"swapped one problem for another\".<ref>''2000 AD'' #1812</ref>\n\nWhen Dredd was abducted in 2136, Smiley told Hershey she didn't need to worry about Dredd's safety; he seemed unconcerned about the impact on Justice Department of Dredd being seen to be defeated.<ref>Megazine #348: \"Rad To The Bone Part 2\"</ref>\n\nThe character Judge Smiley honours the [[John le Carr\u00e9]] character [[George Smiley]], an important supporting character and later central character in many of his post-war espionage stories.\n\n===Solomon===\n\n'''Judge Hollins Solomon''' succeeded [[#Fargo|Judge Fargo]] as Chief Judge of the United States in 2051, and in the following year became Chief Judge of [[Mega-City One]], when Mega-City Two and Texas City acquired their own chief judges for the first time. In 2058 he resigned and was succeeded by his deputy, [[#Goodman|Clarence Goodman]] (with whom he had served as joint deputy chief judge under Fargo). Instead of appointing a new deputy chief judge, Goodman appointed a Council of Five to advise him, and Solomon served on the Council from its inception until after the judges seized power from the president and Congress in 2070. In 2071 Solomon presided over the war crimes trial of [[#President Robert L. Booth|President Bob Booth]], sentencing him to 100 years in suspended animation so that a future generation could decide what to do with him. It is not known what became of Solomon after that, but he does not appear in ''Judge Dredd'' stories except in flashbacks in ''[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]'' and ''[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]''.\n\n===Stark===\n\nA [[Brit-Cit]] exchange cadet, '''Stark''' applied for full transfer to Mega-City One. He first appeared in ''[[The Hunting Party (Judge Dredd story)|The Hunting Party]]'',<ref>''2000 AD'' #1033</ref> undergoing a hotdog run under Dredd and tracking down dune sharks; he showed himself to be a capable Judge and bonded with fellow cadet Renga. He would later be part of Dredd's team during the [[The Doomsday Scenario|Second Robot War]], helping liberate the city: it was his suggestion that they reprogram Narcos' Assassinator droids and use them against him.\n\nWhen sent undercover to combat a block mafia in Shirley Temple Block, Stark was infected with Grubb's Disease by a mob boss \u2013 as was his partner, an old comrade of Stark's who he'd brought in on the operation. Driven mad by the death and the terminal infection, he killed himself to infect the mob boss. His body was returned to Brit-Cit.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1193\u20131196</ref>\n\n===Steel===\n\n'''Judge Amy Steel''' was the sidekick of Dredd in [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]]'s ''Judge Dredd'' audios for Big Finish. An exchange Cadet from [[Brit-Cit]], she was a competent and bright-minded young Judge, assisting Dredd in several cases including against Judge Death; during her rookie assessment, she destroyed the Frendz syndicate's hovership headquarters and took out its current boss. It was eventually revealed that her stepfather was infamous Brit-Cit gangster Harry Karter, who she believed had killed her father when she was a young child; in fact, it turned out she had (accidentally) killed him, and her mother had made a deal with Karter to erase this from her mind. While Karter was brought down, Amy Steel was psychologically damaged and turned in her Judge badge. Amy Steel was played by [[Claire Buckfield]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Vass===\n\n'''Judge Vass''' is (or was) a senior judge and became a member of the Council of Five in 2132.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1693 and 1700</ref>\n\nDuring ''[[Day of Chaos]]'', he clashed with General Poll over the fate of civilian hostages and found Poll's comments about street Judge ineffectiveness \"uncalled for\". Despite this, he voted in favour of air strikes that would doom the hostages.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1750</ref> When the Chaos Virus reached the city anyway, Vass proposed rounding up the first-stage infected, flying them to Cursed Earth burial pits on the pretence of taking them to a medical facility, and then killing them en route. Chief Judge Francisco condemned this as \"monstrous\" and refused to do it, but the proposal was leaked to the public<ref>''2000 AD'' #1777</ref> and caused a citywide uprising. Vass was left horrified by what he had inadvertently caused and resigned, returning to the streets.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1783</ref> It is not known whether he survived.\n\n===Volt===\n\n'''Chief Judge Hadrian Volt''' was chief judge from 2116 to 2121. He first appeared in prog 917 (1994) in a story by John Wagner and [[Carlos Ezquerra]].\n\nVolt became a street judge in 2096 and fought in the First [[The Robot Wars|Robot War]] and the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]]. He later served in the Special Judicial Squad and in the Aliens Bureau. In 2114 he was promoted to chief of Sector 53, where his outstanding administrative ability and judgement reduced violent crime in his sector to the second lowest level in the city.<ref>''2000 AD'' #917</ref>\n\nWhen [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] resigned her office in 2116, there was no Council of Five to choose a new chief judge in the normal way, since she had dissolved the Council years earlier. Therefore she ordered that her successor be elected by the city's 400 Senior Judges. After careful consideration, Volt decided to stand as a candidate in this unprecedented election, and polled a clear majority of the votes (208), defeating three other candidates, including Judge Dredd himself. (Ironically most people had believed that Dredd would win, but \u2013 as Dredd himself observed \u2013 he had annoyed too many judges over the years. Dredd even voted for Volt himself!)<ref name=\"2000 AD #918\">''2000 AD'' #918</ref>\n\nVolt immediately set about instituting significant constitutional reforms. He reinstated the Council and permanently established the new system of electing chief judges. In 2117 he restored the obsolete office of Mayor of Mega-City One and created a council of elected citizens to give the people more say in how they were governed (although ultimate power continued to reside with the Justice Department).<ref>''2000 AD'' #957</ref> He also established a policy of encouraging the judges to foster better relations with the community.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 3 #9</ref>\n\nHe was also the author of two books: ''Riding the Apocalypse,'' a history of the Apocalypse War,<ref name=\"2000 AD #1167\">''2000 AD'' #1167</ref> and ''Just Justice,'' setting out his ideas for legal and political reforms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nIn many ways Volt proved to be an outstanding chief judge. But when the city was overrun in the [[The Doomsday Scenario|Second Robot War]] of 2121 he blamed himself for having failed to do enough to prevent it. Even when the war was ultimately won, the burden of personal responsibility weighed too heavily on his mind for him to bear. He waited until the bitter end, and then at the moment of victory he shot himself.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 3 #59</ref>\n\nBut the general public would never be told the truth. [[Judge Hershey|Acting Chief Judge Hershey]] decided that in the aftermath of such a cataclysmic conflict the Judges' interests required a more heroic death for their fallen leader. The Public Deception Unit therefore set about concocting a false story in which Volt had died valiantly in combat, and fabricated the evidence to prove it.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1167\" />\n\nVolt was the perfect Judge to reform the Justice System which under his two predecessors had become badly corrupt and damaged.<ref name=\"2000 AD #918\" /> Ultimately however he simply was not up to the job of wartime leader. This has however been true of many chief judges, with power usually passing to Dredd in times of crisis, as seen for example in the Apocalypse War and Necropolis.\n\nVolt was succeeded by Deputy Chief Judge Hershey, who was elected chief judge in her own right in early 2122.\n\n==Other Judges==\n\n===Bruce===\n\nA judge in the [[Sydney]]-[[Melbourne]] Conurb, '''Judge Lenny Bruce''' was Dredd's liaison and partner when Dredd came to Australia on the trail of both the Judda and [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]] in 2110. Bruce was a highly laid-back officer, stunned a bit by his American counterpart's more brutal methods. He eventually tired of Dredd's obsession with catching Chopper, who had broken no Oz laws, and snapped at him and overrode Dredd's authority, allowing Chopper safe passage.<ref>\"Oz\" part 26, in ''2000 AD'' #570</ref> Later, when StigCorp was targeting Chopper, the skysurfer tried to contact Bruce for aid \u2013 the judge was transferred to Chunder Range before that could happen.\n\nWhen Judgement Day broke out in 2114, Judge Bruce both battled the zombies in Oz and later died as part of the multi-national Judge force sent to end the crisis.<ref>''Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #8</ref> Before his death, he showed friendly relations with both Judge-Sergeant Joyce and [[Strontium Dog|Johnny Alpha]]. His first name was revealed during the Judgement Day serial.\n\n===Bulgarin and Kazan===\n'''Supreme Judge Bulgarin''' was ruler of East Meg One until the [[Apocalypse War]]. He delegated the invasion of Mega-City One to his most trusted general, '''War Marshal Kazan'''. However Bulgarin's confidence was misplaced as Kazan assassinated him and took his place. Kazan was executed by Dredd at the end of the war.<ref>''2000 AD'' #245\u2013270</ref>\n\n===Joyce===\n'''Judge-Sergeant Charlie Joyce''' is an Irish Judge. He has a wife and son; Murphyville having a more liberal approach to its Judge Militia than other mega-cities.\n\nHe partnered with Dredd when Dredd was sent to Ireland to extradite a suspect in 2113, with his laidback approach to law enforcement and fondness for drink annoying the Mega-City Judge; for his part, he tried to get Dredd to relax. While skilled in combat, Joyce was left horrified when the Sons of Erin dissidents, under guidance from a Mega-City mob blitzer, launched a brutal terrorist attack: \"I'd have never believed it.\"<ref>\"Emerald Isle\", progs 727\u2013734</ref>\n\nIn the following year, during the [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]] crisis, he defended Murphyville from zombie hordes. He was supposed to accompany Dredd on a suicide mission to kill the necromagus Sabbat, and cheerfully backed Dredd as the best candidate for leading the mission, but he was knocked unconscious and replaced by [[Strontium Dog|Johnny Alpha]]. He saw out the crisis in [[Hondo City]] instead, fighting in the last battle at Hondo's walls.\n\nHe was sent on a hazardous extradition assignment to [[Mega-City One]] soon after. After trying to put up with the more violent city and Dredd and Hershey's unfriendly attitude, he was seriously wounded and finally snapped at Dredd: on his way back home, he told him \"you can stick your Mega-City.\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #808</ref> The 2135-set story \"New Tricks\" implies that Joyce has since died.\nHis son '''Fintan Joyce''' became a Judge as well, starting in 2132. Fintan had grown up wanting to be a Mega-City One Judge and in 2135, he was transferred to the American city (severely lacking in Judges after [[Day of Chaos|Chaos Day]]). Despite his courage, he had trouble adjusting.<ref>Prog 1850: \"Judge Dredd: New Tricks Part One\"</ref>\n\n===Anatoli Kazan===\n\n'''Anatoli Kazan''' is the crippled clone son of '''War Marshal Kazan'''. He was originally a cadet of East Meg Two and was a thorn in Judge Dredd's side, attacking him through his niece [[Vienna Dredd|Vienna]]. He later defected to Mega-City One where he offered to help Defence Division.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1466</ref> Dredd was highly suspicious of Kazan's true motives and persuaded the Chief Judge not to trust him, but the [[Council of Five]] overruled them and voted to employ Kazan (under strict supervision). Kazan's advice and inside information led to Mega-City One's regime change action in [[Ciudad Barranquilla]], in order to prevent a Sov attempt to do the same; Kazan was drawn looking sinister at the end of the story, suggesting a deeper agenda to his actions.<ref>Judge Dredd Megazine 246-9, \"Regime Change\"</ref>\n\nKazan seemed likely to become a significant villain in future stories by writer [[Gordon Rennie]], until Rennie announced his retirement from writing comics in 2008.<ref name=\"sundaymail\">[http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/lifestyle/jobs-in-scotland/2008/05/11/meet-the-big-game-hunters-78057-20413507/ Meet The Big Game Hunters], ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|The Sunday Mail]]'', May 11, 2008</ref> In 2012 writer [[Al Ewing]] brought the character back,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1803</ref> in a story described by the editor as a prelude to coming events. (In this story, Kazan remarked \"and here I thought you'd forgotten me\")\n\nFollowing the events of the Day of Chaos, Dredd advocated killing Kazan: he found it suspicious that \"the one time you ''don't'' have info on the Sovs is when they're about to ''hit'' us\". Kazan denied this, pointing out he'd been cut off from the Sovs for the last seven years and would have outdated intelligence. He also showed he had outside sources and knew that the Council of Five was being reorganised, and felt the new Undercover Operations regime would be keeping him alive.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1803</ref>\n\nKazan was assassinated on the orders of [[#Smiley|Judge Smiley]] in 2140.<ref>''2000 AD'' 2104</ref>\n\n==='Timbo' Parkerston-Trant===\n\n'''Detective Judge Timothy Parkerston-Trant''' was an upper-class Judge on track to making senior rank, who \u2013 after the death of the Star Chamber \u2013 is one of the few such men ''not'' purged from Senior Judge ranks as he's got actual detective skill. His great-uncle \"Fluffy\" was a member of the Council of the Star Chamber. Nobody wanted to work with him due to his overbearingly cheery nature, until Armitage took him as a partner out of desperation; he asks everyone to call him Timbo, but only Armitage and Treasure Steel actually do.\n\n===Treasure Steel===\n\nA Detective-Judge in Brit-Cit, Steel is a long term partner of [[Armitage (comics)|Armitage]] and her first task as a rookie was to apprentice with him. She has much the same views on her job and the city as Armitage, though unlike him she possesses a home life with her wife Terri and their son.\n\nShe was actually created and programmed as a 'sleeper' assassin at a secret facility in the Manchester ruins, with false memory implants. The memory wipe began to break down in 2131, causing her to start thinking she'd grown up in an orphanage in Manchester (something that everyone knew could not be possible) and become more violent, causing her to be committed to a psychiatric ward for a time. According to Armitage, she was terminated from the project and farmed out to Justice Department instead of being sold to the criminal Overlords, but she is not entirely sure he was telling her the truth.<ref>''Megazine'' #285 \u2013 290: \"Armitage: The Mancunian Candidate\"</ref>\n\nAs well as appearing in the ''Armitage'' comic series in the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'', Steel has also appeared in three novels by [[Dave Stone]]: ''[[Deathmasques]]'' (Virgin Books, 1993), ''[[The Medusa Seed]]'' (Virgin, 1994) and ''[[Psykogeddon]]'' (Black Flame, 2006).\n\n==Perpetrators==\n===Don Uggie Apelino===\n\n'''Don Uggie Apelino''' was a [[genetic engineering|genetically altered]] intelligent ape who encountered Dredd several times \u2013 first during a gang war{{Issue|date=November 2009}}, and later after a foiled attempt to have Dredd assassinated{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. After the [[Apocalypse War]], radiation regressed his intelligence to that of a normal ape, whereupon he led a group of insane and brutal apes in the Cursed Earth. Dredd followed a regressed Fast Eeek, and executed the gang \u2013 including Apelino \u2013 as a danger to Mega City residents.<ref>Law of the Jungle \u2013 2000ad Annual 1983</ref>\n\nIn the [[IDW Publishing]] 2013 series ''\"[[Mars Attacks]] Judge Dredd\"'', Apelino features with his intelligence intact as a major character in the plot \u2013 initially the leader of a mafia syndicate in sector 301, then later assisting Dredd and [[Judge Anderson|Anderson]] in the fight against the Martians once his gang has been eliminated. (IDW's stories are not necessarily on the same canon as ''2000 AD's''.)\n\nApelino was often accompanied by his two henchmen Fast Eeek and Joe Bananas.\n\n===Judge Bachmann===\n{{too long|section|date=March 2020}}\n'''Judge Carolyn Bachmann''' is a character in the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' comic strip appearing in British comics ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' and the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''. She was the main villain in the 2012 stories \"The Cold Deck\" and \"[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|Trifecta]]\".\n\n[[Al Ewing]] told ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' \"Originally, Bachmann was just someone for Dredd to bounce off, so the second half of that story could take place in real time, a month after the first half. And then it turned out that she was very popular, so I felt that I needed to finish her story quickly, so she wasn\u2019t just another Dredd villain simmering in the background for years and years, which was why I pushed for her to be the Big Bad of \u2018Trifecta\u2019. It was literally me saying, \u2018I have a villain going spare, can we use her?\u2019\"<ref>[http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/12/05/blog-judge-dredd-writer-al-ewing-on-2000ads-surprising-crossover/ SFX: Judge Dredd Writer Al Ewing on 2000AD\u2019s Surprising Crossover]</ref>\n\nBachmann first appeared in \"Family Man\" in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #313 (2011), but in ''2000 AD'' #1809 she was [[retcon|retroactively]] stated to have been in charge of Black Ops Division for many years before and deliberately kept out of sight. It was later revealed that she had been appointed by [[Judge McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] in 2114 and had been involved in protecting the city during the various disasters since then.<ref name=\"2000AD1812\">''2000 AD'' #1812</ref> When Hershey came to power, Bachmann was waiting and began to make herself indispensable.<ref name=\"2000AD1809\">''2000 AD'' #1809</ref>\n\nHer Black Ops agents were secretly programmed by her to revere Mega-City One as a holy \"God City,\" and called Bachmann \"Your Holiness.\"<ref name=\"2000AD1811\">''2000 AD'' #1811</ref> [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] described Bachmann as \"vicious, underhanded \u2013 power-mad, even,\" but careful to cover up any trace of illegal action.<ref name=\"2000AD1809\"/> Unknown to Hershey, since 2128 Bachmann had been using her [[black budget]] to develop an alliance with the firm Overdrive Incorporated, who began building a secret \"Luna-2\" megacity on the moon.<ref name=\"2000AD1809\"/>\n\nWhen Dredd first met Bachmann in ''Megazine'' #313, she claimed to just be administration staff (it later turned out she really did deal with office supplies as a hobby), but he was aware she was really Black Ops. He suspected her of orchestrating a series of murders, including of a judge and mutant deputies, in Township Three in the [[Cursed Earth]]. Bachmann as good as admitted that she had done this, and arranged for a less mutant-friendly judge to take command of the township. She threatened Dredd and advised him to leave the matter alone.\n\nIn 2134, following the citywide devastation of \"[[Day of Chaos]]\" (2011\u201312), Chief Judge Hershey announced that Bachmann would be joining the [[Council of Five]] as the head of a new Undercover Operations Division, which would also include the [[Special Judicial Squad]] (internal affairs). Dredd was outraged, saying it was like putting \"a cockroach in charge of the exterminators\", but he had no proof that she was corrupt.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1803</ref> SJS chief [[Judge Buell]], who now reported to her, worried that she might become chief judge in a few years and that she was preparing to reorganise Undercover to grab power.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1806</ref> Neither Buell nor Dredd, however, were aware that Hershey had put Bachmann on the Council in order to force her into a public position, where she could not hide. For her part, Hershey was not aware that Bachmann was spying on her, and any other opponent, with a secret psi-judge.\n\nBachmann was the antagonist of ''Trifecta'' (2012). Soon after her promotion, she brainwashed Wally Squad chief Judge Folger into downloading a file with the identities of every undercover Judge and Mega-City spy, arranging for it to be passed onto the corrupt Overdrive Inc. (Folger was accidentally killed in the attempt.) Buell discovered Folger's body and that the file had gone missing, but was unaware of what the file contained or that Bachmann was involved. Afraid she would use that as an excuse for a \"reorganisation\", Buell asked Dredd to find the file so they would not have to inform Bachmann, just as she had expected. The file was sent to Overdrive Inc., while Bachmann ordered Black Ops to kill every name on the list so she could \"restock\" the Squad with her own men.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1804-9</ref> Meanwhile, she was brainwashing large numbers of rich citizens with the \"Church of Simpology\" organisation, both creating a secondary army and indoctrinating the owner of a company that made sleep machines: this would allow her to brainwash judges as well. Her end goal was to seize power, bring Luna-2 down from the moon, and create a theocratic regime where the people would ascend to \"heaven\" (Luna-2) and any troublesome elements would be condemned to \"hell\" (Mega-City One). As far as she was concerned, the Justice Department model no longer worked.<ref name=\"2000AD1811\"/>\n\nHowever Bachmann was not aware that the list had been swapped for another list by an agent working for [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Smiley|Judge Smiley]], her predecessor as head of Black Ops, who was investigating her and Overdrive Inc.. Smiley had secretly recruited Judge Dredd and other judges in order to expose and destroy her. When she realised that her plan had been discovered, she tried to gain power by overt force, ordering her men to kill everyone in the [[Grand Hall of Justice]] and attempting to take the chief judge as a hostage. However her men were defeated by Dredd, Hershey, [[Jack Point]], [[Low Life (comics)|\"Dirty\" Frank]] and [[Galen DeMarco]]. Bachmann was able to physically overpower her opponents and was about to kill Dredd when Smiley himself appeared and killed her.<ref name=\"2000AD1812\"/>\n\n===Bella Bagley===\n'''Bella Bagley''' was an unlucky-in-love woman who fell in love with [[Judge Dredd|Dredd]]. When he rejected her advances she became insane and had to be incarcerated in the psycho-cubes. Escaping twice, on the second occasion she finally decided to kill Dredd in a fit of jealousy and was shot dead.<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=bella Bella Bagley's 2000 AD profile]</ref>\n\n===Mr Bones===\n{{Main|Judge Dredd vs. Aliens}}\n'''Mr Bones''' (original name Dan Riboshevsky) was born in [[Mega-City One]] in 2084. Routine scanning showed he had a [[genetic predisposition]] for [[evil]] and he was expelled from the city to live with other mutants in the Cursed Earth. He returned and entered the [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)#Out of the Undercity|Undercity]] to raise an army,<ref>\"Out of the Undercity,\" ''2000 AD'' #1313\u20131316</ref> but when this was foiled he returned with an even more deadly threat \u2013 the [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorph]]. He came across them when he left the Cursed Earth for a career as a space pirate{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. It is their acid blood which disfigured him and he died when they turned on him.\n\n===President Robert L. Booth===\n'''President Robert Linus Booth''' or '''Bad Bob Booth''' was the last president of the United States.\n\nBooth was governor of Texas City, America's third mega-city, and then in 2060 he was elected vice president, with President Harvisson. He became president during Harvisson's second term, and rigged the 2068 election to become president in his own right, murdering an aide who was about to implicate him. In 2070 he started a nuclear world war, which devastated the planet, and most of America outside its three mega-cities became an irradiated wasteland populated by mutants and bandits, the \"Cursed Earth.\" As a result, the president and Congress were overthrown, democratic government was abolished (except at the municipal level), and each mega-city became an independent city state ruled by its unelected chief judge.\n\nAfter a bloody civil war in which over 100,000 soldiers and street judges lost their lives, Booth was captured and put on trial in 2071. The presiding judge, [[#Solomon|Judge Solomon]], was reluctant to execute the last US president, so he sentenced him to 100 years in suspended animation in the deepest vault in [[Fort Knox]], so that a future generation could decide what to do with him.\n\nIn 2100 Booth's suspended animation was interrupted, and [[Judge Dredd (character)|Judge Dredd]] re-sentenced Booth to hard labour for life on a farm in the Cursed Earth. However Booth raised an army of mutants, the New Mutant Army, intending to overthrow the Judges and become president again. When Dredd was sent to deal with him, he captured Dredd and put him on trial for treason against the United States (although Dredd had been a child in 2070, he had participated in the Judges' assault on the White House). Dredd escaped and used Booth as a human shield, but Booth's men \u2013 underpaid and demoralised \u2013 opened fire anyway, reasoning that if they wanted another president then they could always elect one.\n\n===Borisenko===\n'''Colonel Yevgeny Borisenko''' was the mastermind of a plan to destroy Mega-City One in 2134, in the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]'' (2011\u201312). He succeeded in wiping out seven eighths of the population by infecting them with a deadly biological weapon. He was a soldier of East-Meg One who had survived the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]] in 2104, but had been blinded by the flash of the nuclear detonation which destroyed his home city, and had harboured a desire for vengeance ever since. He was captured by Judge Dredd but murdered by one of his sleeper agents during interrogation, after living for long enough to see his plan succeed.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1743\u20131789</ref>\n\n===Call-Me-Kenneth===\n'''Call-Me-Kenneth''' was a robot who appointed himself as leader of all rogue robots during the [[The Robot Wars|First Robot War]]. Kenneth was a carpentry droid driven to rebel by his poor treatment by his owner. Kenneth, equipped with a chainsaw, attacked a number of humans and nearly killed Dredd before being disabled.<ref>''2000 AD'' #9</ref>\nThe Judges then had Kenneth rebuilt, so that scientists could determine what made him break the laws of robotics. Drawn by [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] (the original version was designed by [[Carlos Ezquerra]]), this version is more human like and is equipped with a large drill and a third eye. Accidentally reactivated he instead went on the rampage again and raised a whole army of robots to take over the city. His army was defeated when Walter the Wobot sabotaged the robot factory, producing robots loyal to the Judges, which destroyed the factory. The remaining robots were short-circuited when Dredd used Weather Control to make a lightning storm, and Dredd then hunted down Kenneth himself.<ref>''2000 AD'' #10\u201317</ref>\n\n===Chief Judge Cal===\n'''Judge Cal''' was an insane chief judge of Mega-City One who sentenced the entire population to death in 2101. He was the main villain of the 20-episode story ''The Day the Law Died'' in 1978\u20131979. His name and character were inspired by the mad Roman emperor [[Caligula]].\n\nCal was deputy chief judge and head of the Special Judicial Squad (internal affairs) until he assassinated [[#Goodman|Chief Judge Goodman]] in 2100 or 2101. He automatically became chief judge. His first official acts were to appoint his pet goldfish deputy chief judge, and to sentence Judge Dredd to death for accusing him of murdering Goodman. Most of the other judges had been brainwashed to obey Cal, even while they knew he was mad, using advanced technology, but Dredd, [[#Judge Giant Snr|Giant]] and a few others had escaped this fate. Giant rescued Dredd from execution, and Dredd recruited other judges to their cause, including [[#Griffin|Judge Griffin]], principal of the Academy of Law. Dredd led a citizens' revolution against Cal, but it was defeated by alien mercenaries hires by Cal, called the Kleggs, man-eating lizard-like humanoids who accepted payment in human flesh.\n\nAs punishment for the revolt, Cal sentenced the entire population to death, in alphabetical order, starting with Aaron A. Aardvark. Dredd arranged for Judge Fish to be secretly assassinated, reasoning that the superstitious Cal would think it was a sign of divine disapproval; Cal called off the executions. The Klegg leader, Grampus, was appointed deputy chief judge.\n\nIt wasn't long before Cal again decided to kill the whole city, however, and this time all at once by using a weapon of mass destruction. Dredd's band of resistance fighters was much depleted by this time, and only by sabotaging and reversing Cal's brainwashing technique were they able to defeat Cal in time. Dredd was nominated to replace Cal as chief judge, but he declined, nominating Griffin instead.\n\n===The Creep===\nThe Creep is an apparently [[Immortality|immortal]] mutant living in the [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)|Undercity]] (the remains of old New York City).<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=CREEP The Creep's profile]</ref>\n\nHe is a brilliant but strange maniac able to morph his face and body into every terror imaginable. He takes great delight in torturing those who come from the Mega City down into the Undercity who disturb his playground of horrors. On one occasion The Creep tortured a hunting party that descends to the Undercity. An example of his bizarre behaviour was transplanting the head of one of the members on to the neck of his pet crocodile Yorkie.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nDuring [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]] The Creep left the undercity and met the four [[Dark Judges]]. Judge Fire burned the Creep alive. Judge Fear stared into his face and Judge Mortis touched his flesh, all to no avail. In the end the quartet fled this invincible monster,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and he has not been heard of since.\n\n===Vitus Dance===\n'''Vitus Dance''' was a freelance assassin from the Cursed Earth. He had [[psionics|psionic powers]], including [[pyrokinesis]] (the ability to set fires with his mind), [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], and the power to control the minds of others. The strength of his powers was amplified by [[scorpion]] poison, and he carried two pet scorpions with him to sting him when necessary. In 2117 Dance was hired by mob boss [[#Nero Narcos|Nero Narcos]] to kill an informer in judicial custody, a task which he accomplished by allowing himself to be arrested to get close enough to his victim, and then escaping. He was caught by Judges Dredd and Castillo, and served four years in solitary confinement, during which time he became insane. He escaped by faking his own death and then breaking out of the ambulance taking him to the morgue. Narcos still hoped to use him, but Dance tried to take over his mind. Narcos escaped and betrayed Dance to the Judges, who eventually killed him after many of them were slain.<ref>''2000 AD'' #955\u2013959, 1125\u20131132</ref>\n\n===Dark Judges===\n[[File:JudgeDeathIrving.jpg|thumb|right|Judge Death, the leader of the Dark Judges, shortly after \"judging\" (i.e. killing) an alleged perpetrator.]]\nThe '''Dark Judges''' are four undead judges from another dimension, known as Deadworld. Centuries ago the judges of what was to become Deadworld decided that since all crime is committed by the living, then life itself should be made illegal. They then set about executing everyone in the world, until only four Dark Judges were left: '''Judge Death''', Judge Fire, Judge Fear and Judge Mortis. They were made undead by two witches, Phobia and Nausea, the '''Sisters of Death''', who became undead themselves. Eventually acquiring the technology to travel to other dimensions, they came to Earth and attacked Mega-City One. They have been defeated by Judges Dredd and Anderson several times, but each time only after inflicting great loss of life, most notably in 2112 when they killed 60 million citizens and thousands of judges.\n\nAll four Dark Judges, most prominently Judge Death, speak with a characteristic hiss. For example, their signature phrase is often rendered as \"The crime isss life! The sssentence isss... '''death'''!\"\n\n====Judge Death====\nJudge Death is the founder and leader of the Dark Judges and the arch-enemy of Dredd himself. He is the main antagonist of the series as he is the most recurring villain.\n\nJudge Death was originally Sydney De'ath, the son of a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] travelling dentist who took pleasure on inflicting pain on his patients. Growing up as a corrupt judge, Sydney De'ath would later kill his entire family and later on meet three people who would eventually become the Judges Fear, Mortis and Fire and took them under his wing. He would go on to kill the chief judge of his world and took up the rank as well as meet the Sisters of Death and then become the undead Judge Death and would later battle Dredd many times.\n\nJudge Death's favourite method of killing his victims is to thrust his razor-sharp claws directly into the victim's chest and break the victim's heart.\n\nJudge Death's uniform is a twisted parody of the standard Judge uniform, replacing the helmet's visor with a [[portcullis]], the uniform zipper with crude stitches, and the eagle ornament on the shoulder with a [[pterodactyl]].\n\n====Judge Fear====\nJudge Fear is one of the Dark Judges under Judge Death. As his name states he masters people's fears. Judge Fear wears a [[great helm]] whose visor normally obscures his entire face. He kills his victims by opening his visor and showing his face, which is so horrible that the victim is literally scared to death. Judge Fear's face has only been shown twice in the comics - once as a swirling mass of eyeballs and once as grotesque mandibles. Whether this is his true face or a manifestation of the victim's fears is left unmentioned.\n\n====Judge Mortis====\nOne of the Dark Judges Under Death. Judge Mortis wears no helmet and has a [[sheep]]'s skull for a head. The touch of his hands brings decay, causing the victim to instantly [[decomposition|decompose]], leaving only bare bones. In the prequel Deadworld series he is shown to have been the closest and most trusted to Death of the Dark Judges.\n\n====Judge Fire====\nOne of the Dark Judges under Judge Death's commands. He originally earned the nickname \"Judge Fire\" when still alive and called Judge Fuego, for burning down an entire school for breaking noise regulations during the day. Judge Fire's entire body is permanently engulfed in flames and he wields an equally flaming trident. By throwing his trident he can start lethal fires.\n\n====Sisters of Death====\nTwo undead witch sisters from an unknown dimension who persuaded and turned Judge Death and the other Dark Judges into undead abominations so they would end all life on their world. The claim to have done this on many worlds before and they treat the genocides as a game. The two main ones are Phobia the eldest and Nausea the youngest. There is a third sister who is shown working against them during the genocide of Deadworld but has not appeared in any of the present set Judge Dredd stories. They also have three other cousins, Dementia, Ephemera, and Pustula\n\n===Rico Dredd===\n'''Rico Dredd''' (2066\u20132099) was the \"clone brother\" of Joseph Dredd, which is to say that they were both [[cloning|cloned]] from the same genetic source, in their case [[Chief Judge Fargo]].<ref>\"A Case for Treatment,\" ''2000 AD'' #389</ref> Their growth in the cloning tanks was artificially accelerated, so that within 16 months they emerged with the physical development of children aged five years. They also had their brains electronically induced with knowledge and training which greatly surpassed their apparent physical age, so that they could immediately begin training in law enforcement.<ref>\"Origins,\" ''2000 AD'' #1515</ref> Rico was removed from the cloning tanks twelve minutes before Joe, and so he habitually referred to Joe as his little brother (or \"Little Joe\").<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" ''2000 AD'' #1187</ref>\n\nAt the Academy of Law Rico consistently demonstrated higher levels of skill than Joe, and he graduated at the top of their class in 2079, with Joe coming second.<ref>\"The Return of Rico,\" ''2000 AD'' #30</ref> During his time as a cadet, he requested to join the older cadets in restoring order to the streets of [[Mega-City One]] in the immediate aftermath of the [[Atomic Wars]] of 2070. Rico and Joe served with distinction, and were personally chosen to take part in the raid on the White House to depose [[President Robert L. Booth|President Booth]] (who had usurped his office and had started the War).<ref>\"Origins,\" ''2000 AD'' #1531</ref>\n\nHowever, following an injury during a training mission in the Cursed Earth, Rico began to become more aggressive, underhanded, and determined to prove himself better than Joe. After graduation, Rico began engaging in criminal activities, including extortion, assault and racketeering. Joe suspected that this was the result of exposure to radiation when Rico was injured on a training mission in the Cursed Earth.<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" ''2000 AD'' #1187\u201388</ref>\n\nWhen Joe witnessed Rico murder an innocent cafe owner who had refused to pay him protection money, Joe arrested him. Rico was sentenced to twenty years [[hard labour]] on the prison colony of [[Titan in fiction|Titan]], where he grew to hate his brother. While on Titan there he illicitly fathered a daughter, Vienna, with a reporter who was interviewing him.<ref>\"Blood & Duty,\" ''2000 AD'' #1300</ref>\n\nAfter serving his time on Titan, Rico returned to [[Mega-City One]] seeking revenge on Joe. Confronting him at his home, Rico challenged him to a duel to settle their differences, knowing that with his superior skills he could always outdraw his brother. However he had grown used to the weaker gravity of Titan after his twenty years there. This slowed him down by a split second and allowed Joe to shoot him dead. Carrying his brother's lifeless body out into the street, Joe declined a paramedic's offer of assistance, allowing the writer, [[Pat Mills]], to conclude the story with a line from [[the Hollies]] song, [[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother|\"He ain't heavy \u2013 he's my brother!\"]]<ref>\"The Return of Rico,\" ''2000 AD'' #30</ref>\n\nAlthough in the original story, Rico was depicted wearing a [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge's]] badge with the name \"Dredd\", some artists in later stories have erroneously drawn him with a badge labelled \"Rico\" as though it were his surname. This is possibly based on confusion with the character [[#Rico|Judge Rico]], whose surname is Rico and whose badge therefore bears that name.\n\nThe 1994 Judge Dredd novel ''[[Dread Dominion]]'' by [[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]] depicts a universe where Dredd executed Rico rather than arrest him and descended into madness. Tte fact that Rico's badge read \"Dredd\" was part of the plot. In a [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universe]], Joe shot Rico instead of arresting him. The bullet went through the second ''D'' in Rico's badge. Joe kept the badge as a souvenir, and eventually had the letter ''A'' substituted and wore it, and changed his name to Dread.\n\n===Judge Edgar===\n\nAlthough in most of her stories '''Judge Jura Edgar''' is not evil or a murderer in the manner of most villains in the ''Judge Dredd'' series (though in her last story it transpires that she is responsible for a number of murders), she is nevertheless one of Dredd's adversaries. She was the head of the Public Surveillance Unit from 2100 to 2122, and then the governor of a [[prison farm]] in the [[Cursed Earth]].\n\nAn ambitious judge, in the 2090s Edgar was part of a small group of judges that committed vigilante murders, under the alias of the Citizens' Court. By working at PSU, Edgar was able to ensure that the others were not caught. After seventeen killings, she had the group disbanded so it could not cause problems for her career advancement.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1589\u20131595</ref>\n\nEdgar became head of PSU when she lost the use of her legs after receiving a back injury when wounded in the line of duty.<ref>Prog 955</ref> She moved around using a hoverchair (anti-gravity wheelchair), and became renowned for her strict discipline and high expectations of her staff. She became PSU's longest serving head, serving twenty-two years.<ref>Prog 955</ref> She occasionally used the wealth of confidential information at her disposal to play power games with other judges to increase her own influence. One notable example of this is when, to avenge herself on Judge Dredd for a perceived slight against her, she orchestrated a disciplinary investigation into [[Galen DeMarco|Judge DeMarco]] \u2013 one of Dredd's associates \u2013 which led to DeMarco's resignation.<ref>Prog 1132</ref> Edgar's reputation for this sort of behaviour led people to compare her to the 20th century FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], and she acquired the nickname \"J. Edgar Hover\" (only ever used behind her back).<ref>Prog 955</ref>\n\nIn 2117 she was discovered to be illicitly keeping sensitive information on other senior judges, which had been compiled by [[#Chief Judge Cal|Judge Cal]] for the purposes of blackmail when he was head of the Special Judicial Squad, the Judges' internal affairs division. [[Judge Volt|Chief Judge Volt]] decided to take no action against her, but when [[Judge Hershey]] succeeded him as chief judge in 2122, Hershey immediately had Edgar arrested and investigated by the SJS.<ref>Prog 1178</ref> On trial before the [[Council of Five]], Edgar defended herself with skill and defiance. She briskly and brusquely discredited what had initially seemed to be overwhelming evidence, reducing the prosecution case to nothing more than empty innuendo, and claiming that the charge was politically motivated.<ref>Prog 1179</ref>\n\nBesides the seniority of the defendant, Edgar's trial is also notable for being the first occasion when [[Judge Dredd]] ever sat on the Council \u2013 having always declined a permanent seat \u2013 when he agreed to sit in a vacant seat to make up the numbers for the duration of the trial.<ref>Prog 1179</ref>\n\nAlthough Edgar was acquitted of all criminal charges, she was still dismissed from office by Chief Judge Hershey. [[Judge Niles]], who was head of SJS and who had personally led the investigation (and brought the whole affair to Hershey's attention in the first place), was transferred from SJS to take over command of the PSU. Edgar was demoted to the lowly position of commanding Cursed Earth Correctional Facility 17, where she remained for eight years.<ref>Prog 1179</ref>\n\nBy 2130 she was in very ill health and on the verge of death from cancer. As part of a final scheme for revenge, she steered Dredd towards the remaining members of the Citizens Court, in the hope that Dredd would be killed by one of them resisting arrest. By the time Dredd had uncovered her involvement she had died, too late for him to arrest her for the murders.<ref>Prog 1595</ref><ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=EDGAR 2000 AD profile]</ref>\n\n===Efil Drago San===\n\nCreated by [[Dave Stone]], Efil Drago San is a notorious and bloodthirsty crime lord. He was born on Puerto Luminae, a lunar colony that refused to buy into the Justice System and faced a heavy trade embargo as a consequence \u2013 as a result, starvation and poverty ensued and Drago San ended up developing a taste for killing.<ref>''Judge Dredd: War Crimes'' audio drama by Stone</ref> He used to operate as a crime lord in [[Brit-Cit]], where he controlled many corrupt high-ranking Judges and developed a nemesis in [[Detective-Judge Armitage]]. Armitage crippled him, forcing him to use a hoverpod to remain mobile; in revenge, Drago San murdered the Judge's wife. Afterwards, they operated under a principle that if Armitage ever harmed Drago San, a large number of innocent people would be killed in response.<ref>''Armitage: Influential Circles'', Megazine 2.13</ref>\n\nIn the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] ''2000 AD'' audio dramas, Drago San fled to Mega-City One and ran afoul of Judge Dredd after setting up the ultraviolent snuff sport The Killing Zone. Following this, he fled off-world but was finally apprehended in the Boranos System by Dredd. Due to the global nature of his crimes, in the book ''[[Psykogeddon]]'' he was put on trial \u2013 but he escaped, killing Brit-Cit's Star Chamber ruling body as he went, and his whereabouts are unknown. He has operations in Brit-Cit still, run by an agent called Ms Frobisher, as shown in Megazine #269.\n\nIn the audio CDs, Drago San is voiced by [[Stephen Greif]].\n\n===Grice===\n'''Judge Grice''' was a street judge who conspired to assassinate Judge Dredd in order to prevent the 2113 referendum about the future of the Justice Department. He was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in the penal colony on Titan, but two years later \u2013 in his own series, ''Purgatory'' \u2013 he escaped. He attacked Mega-City One and killed millions with a weaponised virus before Dredd killed him.\n\n===Hester Hyman===\n{{Main|Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)}}\n'''Hester Hyman''' was an ordinary wife and mother who became so despairing of life under the tyranny of the Judges that she turned to terrorism to raise publicity for the cause of democratic reform. Her death at Dredd's hands spurred many ordinary citizens to campaign for democracy.<ref>''2000 AD'' #460, 531\u2013533</ref>\n\n===Morton Judd===\n'''Judge Morton Judd''' was the genetic scientist who in 2066 created Judge Dredd from the DNA of former chief judge [[#Fargo|Fargo]]. Around that time, he was appointed to the Council of Five (which was then only an advisory body to the chief judge). In 2070 he proposed genetically modifying the citizen population to make them more docile; when Fargo vetoed his plan Judd attempted to assassinate Fargo, but he was arrested and sentenced to death. He was rescued by his accomplices, and fled to an unknown location, which forty years later was discovered to be [[Ayer's Rock]] in Australia, where he had built a base. There he had created an army of clones, called the Judda, with which he attempted to seize control of Mega-City One. His plot was uncovered by Judge Dredd, and Judd and most of the Judda were killed when Dredd destroyed his base with a nuclear bomb. \n\nSome of the Judda who had attacked Mega-City One were taken prisoner; most of them were executed, but one was spared: [[#Kraken|Kraken]].\n\n===Kraken===\n'''Kraken''' was originally one of [[#Judd|Morton Judd's]] clone soldiers, the Judda. He was a clone of [[#Fargo|Judge Fargo]], Judge Dredd's clone father, and therefore identical to Dredd, although decades younger. When Judd was defeated and Kraken was taken captive, instead of executing him [[#Silver|Chief Judge Silver]] decided to groom Kraken to replace Dredd one day, and so Kraken became a cadet at the Academy of Law. At first Kraken only pretended to go along with this, secretly intending to remain loyal to Judd, but in time his allegiance shifted to match appearances.\n\nOn graduating from the Academy in 2112, Kraken's final assessment was supervised by Dredd himself. Despite Kraken's flawless performance, Dredd failed him anyway, saying \"a leopard can't change his spots \u2013 not this one, anyway.\" Although Kraken had no right of appeal and Dredd's word was supposedly final, Silver secretly overruled Dredd and set a final test of loyalty for Kraken. Kraken was sentenced to death for his part in Judd's crimes, and given the opportunity to escape. When instead Kraken administered the lethal injection himself \u2013 actually a harmless anesthetic, unknown to him \u2013 Silver pardoned him and made him a judge. But he was not to be Judge Kraken. As Dredd had resigned and left the city, Silver covered up Dredd's departure and ordered Kraken to impersonate him. For more than a dozen episodes of ''Judge Dredd'' after that, the lead character of the strip was actually Kraken, wearing Dredd's badge.\n\nSilver's plan was disastrous. When the [[#Dark Judges|Sisters of Death]] (beings with tremendous psychic powers) prepared to attack Mega-City One, they targeted Dredd first, but on finding out who he really was, they exploited Kraken's past as an enemy of the city and successfully brainwashed him into becoming their instrument of destruction. Under the Sisters' malign influence, Kraken rescued their brothers, the immortal [[#Dark Judges|Dark Judges]], who took over the city and began slaughtering everyone (including Silver). Kraken became a Dark Judge himself (albeit a mortal one). He was only freed when Dredd returned to the city and banished the Sisters of Death (see [[#Agee|Judge Kit Agee]]); by then 60 million people had been killed. Kraken, once again in control of his faculties, submitted peacefully to execution by Dredd.\n\n{{see also|Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)}}\n\n===PJ Maybe===\n'''Philip Janet Maybe''', usually known as PJ Maybe (or by various aliases), is a serial killer who has frequently been arrested by a Judge Dredd, and has almost as frequently escaped arrest. He committed his first murder at age 12, in a story first published in 1987, and committed more murders as a teenager and then as an adult. He often used mind control drugs to force his victims to kill others or themselves. He changed his appearance several times and took over his victims' identities. Most notably, he killed and stole the identity of '''Byron Ambrose''', and in that guise he was elected Mayor of [[Mega-City One]] (after killing the previous mayor and framing a rival candidate for the murder).\n\nIt was information provided by Maybe which led to the arrest of [[#Sinfield|Chief Judge Sinfield]] for using a mind control drug to depose [[#Francisco|Chief Judge Francisco]]. In exchange for this, Maybe's death sentence was commuted by the re-instated Francisco to life without parole, over Dredd's objections, a decision Francisco later regretted when Maybe escaped and killed again.\n\nMaybe's last appearance to date was a 2016 storyline about him cross-dressing to conceal his identity, ending with him finally being killed by Dredd.\n\n===Nero Narcos===\n'''Nero Narcos''' was the leader of the criminal syndicate called '''the Frendz''', who was a recurring villain in late-1990s [[Judge Dredd]] stories. He was responsible for employing [[#Vitus Dance|Vitus Dance]] and [[Sov Judge Orlok|Orlok]] to assassinate a rival criminal, and instigating the Second Robot War.\n\nIn the story ''[[The Doomsday Scenario]]'', Narcos sabotaged a new batch of upgraded [[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|lawgiver]]s by programming them to self-destruct when used by their authorized users (once they received a radio signal, so the rogue command took effect in all weapons simultaneously). This resulted in large numbers of judges being crippled or killed at the precise moment they were attacked by Narcos's Assassinator robots at the beginning of the Second Robot War in 2121. Nero Narcos was swiftly able to conquer [[Mega-City One]] and drive the Judges underground, but once he had the city conquered he found himself unable to actually run it. After a team led by Judge Dredd, with assistance from [[Brit-Cit]], were able to cripple his robotic army, Narcos was defeated and executed.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Orlok the Assassin===\n\n'''Orlok''' was a judge of East-Meg One, a mega-city in the former Russia. In 2103 Orlok infected Mega-City One's water supply with a substance which caused the population to become insanely violent. This was a precursor to invasion, the first stage of the Apocalypse War. Orlok was captured by Judge Dredd, but he was later rescued and he attacked the city several more times before finally being executed.\n\n===Chief Judge Oswin===\n\n'''Pamela Oswin''' became Texas City's chief judge in 2137. When Brit Cit abandoned Mega City One and demanded Dredd's extradition over the Murphyville Spaceport massacre,<ref>\"Blood of Emeralds,\" ''2000 AD'' #1934\u20131939</ref> Chief Judge Hershey turned to Oswin for help. She quickly arrived and brought a large number of her judges to act a reinforcements for Mega City One's diminished numbers. She quickly had her judges placed in strategic locations throughout the city (missile defence, immigration, Grand Hall security). It shortly became apparent that she did not want to help Hershey but usurp her, and then covertly take full control of the city. Her plan was to rebuild America in her own image, where mutants would be persecuted even more, if not completely wiped out (her rallying cry was even \"The South shall rise again\"). Her plans were foiled when Dredd escaped from Brit Cit and, with the help of some loyal judges, was able to storm the Hall of Justice and kill her.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1973\u20131990 and ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #371\u2013373</ref>\n\nOswin's Council of Five later disowned her, claiming that they had no idea what she had really been doing. Hershey and Dredd did not believe this but there was little they could do about it militarily. However Hershey was able to blackmail and force the Texans into making one of her own judges their new chief judge.<ref>''Megazine'' #374</ref>\n\nOswin's story was told in a story arc composed of five stories and collectively known as \"Every Empire Falls\" in ''2000 AD'' #1973\u20131990 and ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #371\u2013374 (2016), written by Michael Carroll.\n\n===Raptaur===\nThe '''Raptaur''' is the name of a deadly species of alien. They can dismember people in seconds with razor-sharp claws, and their preferred food is human brains. They can create a psi-fog at will and also secrete a toxin which saps the will to live and encourages their prey to submit without resistance; several Raptaurs were \"milked\" for this toxin to create a drug.<ref>Megazine #221\u2013223</ref> Dredd encountered and eventually killed one in 2113.<ref>Megazine #1.11\u20131.17</ref> [[Jack Point]] has owned two as pets (Cliq and Larf), and describes them as both \"harder than a diamond on PCP\" and being more dangerous than the [[Judge Dredd vs. Aliens|xenomorphs]] Mr Bones found.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Sabbat the Necromagus===\n{{Main|Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)}}\n'''Sabbat''' was the villain in the story [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|\"Judgement Day\".]] He started the Fourth World War and tried to kill everyone in the world.<ref>''2000 AD'' #786\u2013799; ''Megazine'' vol. 2 #4\u20139</ref>\n\n===Jacob Sardini===\n'''Jacob Sardini'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=taxde Sardini's profile]</ref> was a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] who stuffed dead human bodies. Among those he stuffed were the [[PJ Maybe|Yess family]].

Francisco appointed Sinfield deputy chief judge, in which capacity Sinfield posted Judge Dredd to an assignment in the Cursed Earth. Sinfield then drugged Francisco with a mind-control drug and ordered him to resign. Sinfield's coup was eventually discovered by Judges [[Judge Dredd (character)|Dredd]], [[#Logan|Logan]] and [[#Buell|Buell]], and he was deposed by the Council of Five and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour in the prison on Titan.\n\nAfter a mass breakout from Titan eventually resulted in the deaths of almost all concerned, Sinfield was the sole survivor. He was captured by East-Meg Two for interrogation, and rescued by Dredd. He remains in the custody of Mega-City One.\n\n===Spikes Harvey Rotten===\n\nThere have been two characters with this name:\n\n*The first was a biker who was killed in Mega-City One while attempting to win an illegal race.<ref>''2000 AD'' #40\u201341</ref><ref>''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'' (by Colin M. Jarman and Peter Acton, Lennard Publishing, 144 pages, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}) pp. 77 and 84</ref> He was not a noteworthy character.\n*The second was created by [[Pat Mills]] as a sidekick for Dredd in the 1978 story ''[[The Cursed Earth]]''. He was also a biker and a criminal. Dredd had him paroled from custody to accompany him on his perilous mission across the Cursed Earth desert, as he was familiar with the territory from his days smuggling guns there. When all of the judges who accompanied Dredd were killed along the way, Spikes still fought by Dredd's side. He was killed only a short distance from Mega-City Two.<ref name=\"2000 AD #61-85\">''2000 AD'' #61\u201385</ref>\n\n===Whitey===\n'''Randolph Whitely''', a.k.a. '''\"Whitey\"''' was the first [[perp]] to appear in the ''Judge Dredd'' strip, in ''2000 AD'' prog 2. He murdered the first judge to appear in the strip, Judge Alvin, prompting Dredd to arrest him and sentence him to life on Devil's Island: a prison with no need for walls as it is located on a traffic island where the traffic never stops and attempting to cross the road means certain death.\n\nWhitey was the first ''Judge Dredd'' villain to return in a sequel, when he escaped in #31. He also returned in the comic's tenth anniversary issue, #520. Dredd (at first having forgotten who Whitey was) killed him in his last appearance.\n\nWhitey had a brother, who tried to rescue him, destroying the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in the process (this story was published in 1977).<ref>''2000 AD'' 1978 Annual</ref>\n\nWhitey also had a son, who tried to avenge his father 40 years after his arrest, but Dredd killed him. This story, \"Forty Years of Hurt,\" appeared in ''2000 AD'''s [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue in 2017.\n\n==Others==\n\n===Blondel Dupre===\n'''Blondel Dupr\u00e9''' was one of the leaders of the movement for restoring democracy in Mega-City One. She led the [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#The Democratic March|Democratic March]] of 2109 and the 2113 [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#Democracy Referendum|referendum campaign]]. After the first, she was arrested and was only released by Dredd in 2112 due to his crisis of faith over the methods he had used.\n\nWhile Blondel campaigned against the Judges, she had developed some respect for Dredd after he had let her out and instigated a referendum on democracy. She also began to lose faith as a result of her struggle, wondering if she could succeed. When the vote was lost, she was convinced by Dredd that it was not a fix and was forced in public to tell him \"you are the law\" in front of her followers. She retired after losing the vote, no longer believing in the cause.<ref>''2000 AD'' #531\u2013533, 750\u2013756</ref>\n\n===Fargo Clan===\nThe '''Fargo Clan''' are a family of [[Mutants (Judge Dredd)|mutants]] in the Cursed Earth, led by '''Randy Fargo'''. They are distant relatives of Judge Dredd, being descended from Ephram Fargo, the brother of Eustace Fargo, Dredd's clone father. Dredd was unaware of their existence until a chance encounter with them in the Cursed Earth in 2129, when they helped Dredd in an investigation.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1511\u201312</ref> When they tried to visit Dredd in Mega-City One later that year, Dredd was forced to turn them away due to the city's strict anti-mutant laws.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1545</ref> These experiences changed Dredd's hardline anti-mutant views, and led to Dredd securing the repeal of the anti-mutant laws in 2130. Later that year the Fargos were invited back to the city as guests of honour. During a tour of the city '''Jubal Fargo''' was accidentally killed while saving the life of a young child. The family returned to their abode in the Cursed Earth.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1577\u201381</ref>\n\n===Mrs Gunderson===\n'''Mrs Gunderson'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=GUNDERS Mrs Gunderson's profile]</ref> is an elderly, deaf and almost blind woman, who mainly appears in cameos to provide comic relief pertaining to her misinterpretations of what she hears people say or her failure to notice what is happening around her.

In a city teeming with citizens dressed in unusual, eccentric or downright bizarre fashions, Max stood out for dressing conservatively in clothes which in the mid-20th century would have been perfectly normal: a pinstripe suit and a bowler hat, an umbrella, and a carnation in his buttonhole. In contrast to his looks, Max spoke in futuristic 'streetwise' slang and had many bizarre habits and affections. In Max's first appearance, Dredd expresses disgust at Max not dressing in \"decent wild clothes\" like everyone else and asks \"why do you young people always have to be different?\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #20</ref>\n\nHe had refined tastes, eschewing water and only ever drinking \"shampagne\" (real champagne being illegal): this saved him from being affected by the [[Block Mania]] contagion which infected the city's water supply in 2104.<ref>\"Block Mania\" part 7, in ''2000 AD'' #242</ref> His one concession to 22nd-century living was his fondness for playing ''shuggy'', an advanced version of [[billiards]] played on an uneven surface of hills and valleys.

During the Necropolis incident, his eyes were burned out by the Sisters of Death; as a thank-you for his assistance, Dredd personally arranged for Yassa to come to Mega-City One to receive bionic eyes, along with counselling from Psi-Judge Anderson to ease the psychic trauma that Phobia and Nausea caused him.\n\n===Satanus===\n'''[[Satanus (comics)|Satanus]]''' was a [[cloning|cloned]] [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] who attacked Dredd in \"[[The Cursed Earth]].\" Although Dredd believed Satanus to have been killed, he actually survived.<ref>''2000 AD'' #76</ref> He has since appeared in non-Dredd stories such as ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]'', introduced in Book V: \"The Vengeance of Thoth.\"\n\n===Marlon Shakespeare===\n{{too long|section|date=March 2020}}\n'''Chopper''' (also known as '''Marlon Shakespeare''') is a fictional character appearing in British comics anthologies ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''.

Marlon wanted more from life than the mundane existence that his parents revelled in so he broke out and found infamy by becoming Chopper \u2013 a wall scrawler ([[graffiti artist]]), challenging authority by making his mark (a smiley face) in increasingly more ambitious and public locations. Soon Chopper became known as King Scrawler of Mega-City One. That was until a Scrawl War broke out between Chopper and a mysterious rival scrawler known as The Phantom, who challenged Chopper's position as King Scrawler by beating Marlon to some of his more ambitious scrawls and openly mocking Chopper in his scrawl (\"Chopper is a Ninco. Signed The Phantom\"). The Scrawl War escalated with more and more inventive scrawls turning up and confusing the [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]], culminating with Chopper defacing the relocated [[white cliffs of Dover]] in 100&nbsp;ft letters. This angered The Phantom who then publicly challenged Chopper to scrawl the [[Statue of Judgement]] on the following Saturday. When Chopper and The Phantom finally came face to face Chopper was shocked to find that The Phantom was in fact a painting droid. Chopper found himself asking the droid what its motivations for becoming a scrawler were and was just as shocked to learn that they were identical to his own \u2013 To escape the monotony of life and to be somebody. The Phantom refused to be taken by the Judges and plunged to its death, leaving Chopper in awe of the similarity of their lives and wondering, as he was being arrested by [[Judge Dredd]], if that was what we all were \u2013 [[robot]]s.\n\nSeveral years later Judge Dredd crossed paths with Chopper again while searching for the masked felon known as The Midnight Surfer \u2013 A [[sky-surfer]] who had evaded the judges with his highly illegal and very dangerous low-flying surfing. While on rehabilitation, Chopper had been given his first opportunity to use a Powerboard and soon realised he had a natural talent for the sport and had become a Powerboard instructor for young kids living in Tommy McArdle Block. Dredd soon discovered that Chopper was actually the Midnight Surfer and had been merely training for the forthcoming Supersurf 7, an illegal Powerboard contest which was to be held on the streets of Mega-City One. Dredd set up 'Spy In The Sky' cameras to track Chopper's movements in the hope that he could find the secret starting location of the contest and thus preventing the race from happening, but Chopper spotted them and outwitted the remote cameras with his skilful and dangerously daring surfing style. When he arrived Chopper found himself surrounded by such surfing legends as Dak Goodvibes, Johnny Cuba and the world champion Yogi Yakamoto, and within an hour was competing against them in a race of suicidal proportions. Tackling set obstacles and avoiding gunfire from the Judges, the surfers sped through the future city, many falling along the way until there were only two men still with a real chance of winning the race \u2013 Yogi Yakamoto and Chopper. The final obstacle \u2013 surfing in the notorious Manfred Fox tunnel against the flow of high-speed traffic \u2013 served as the backdrop of what was later called by many as the single greatest example of surfing ever seen when Yogi Yakamoto fell after being clipped by a large vehicle and was left struggling to his feet as another large vehicle hurtled towards him. Seeing his Idol's imminent demise, Chopper swung his board around and scooped up the injured surfer before once again turning his board against the flow of the traffic and weaved amongst the vehicles, finishing the race with Yakamoto in his arms. The rescue had been in vain though. As Yakamoto lay on the pavement dying he addressed Chopper \u2013 \"You the best boy...Nobody can do what you do. You...King Surfer...\" Again, Chopper was promptly arrested by Dredd, but this time to the entire city chanting his name.\n\nThree years later, the now legalised Supersurf 10 approaches. The previous two Supersurf contests had somewhat ironically been held legally in the Sydney-Melbourne Conurb (The future Australia) with the full backing of the Oz Judges. Hometown boy Jug McKenzie had been champion ever since and, much to the chagrin of Chopper's fans, was fast earning the reputation of the greatest surfer who ever lived. Despite calls from the citizens of Mega-City One for Chopper to be released in time for him to challenge McKenzie on his home turf, Judge Dredd refused to bow to public opinion. The decision was made by Dredd to move Chopper to a maximum-security isolation cube due to concerns that there would be attempts to free the imprisoned champion. During the transfer a mob rushed the Judges and Chopper managed to escape in the commotion. Unsure of where to run to, Chopper called upon his childhood friend Flip Tillis, who, while supplying Chopper with fresh food and clothes, informed the fugitive of the public's desire for Chopper to regain his crown as King Surfer. Figuring Oz was the one place where everybody wanted him to be Chopper set out on his board and began his historic journey over the 'west wall' into the Cursed Earth. His journey was followed by the Mega-City One media as he evaded Cursed Earth mutants and travels to the Mex-Zone, almost losing his life several times on the way. Finally arriving at the Pacific Ocean, Chopper faced the decision to return to imprisonment or to strike out 11,000 kilometres across the Pacific to Oz with the knowledge that he has nowhere near enough power to complete his journey. During a vicious storm in the Pacific his board runs out of power, and as he guides his board to his death Chopper recalls the chanting of Mega-City One following his winning Supersurf 7.\n\nWith no confirmed sightings of Chopper since the news that he was heading into a hurricane, Mega-City One mourns the loss of a legend, and an old friend of Chopper's \u2013 WipeOut Jones \u2013 is sent to represent the city. The news of Chopper's demise is somewhat premature. As his board spirals down towards the stormy sea Chopper spies a lone ship and guides his board towards it. On board Chopper discovers that the only crew member is a paranoid and murderous robot chef called Cookie, who has a penchant for using his crew members as ingredients. Chopper disposes of Cookie after the insane robot tries to put Chopper on the menu. Chopper's board is badly damaged in the scuffle so takes control of the ship and heads to Oz by sea. Having repaired his board, Chopper ditches the ship 40 kilometres from the coast of Oz and completes the journey on his board. He arrives to a hero's welcome, but Dredd attempts to arrest him. The crowds protest but Dredd argues that Chopper cannot race as he missed the qualifying heats. The qualifying Surfers refuse to race unless Chopper is allowed to compete and Dredd is arrested by local Judges as not to cause a riot. The local authorities set Chopper up with a hotel room and donate to him a Bondi Special powerboard to replace his badly damaged Stratos 4 and he sets out to practice for the race with WipeOut Jones. It soon becomes apparent to Chopper that the Bondi Special powerboard doesn't suit his surfing style. On the day of the race WipeOut Jones offers Chopper his Stratos 4 powerboard stating that he (Jones) is merely there to make up the numbers and had no real chance of winning the race. Jug McKenzie taunts Chopper as the pair swap boards, claiming that chopper is clutching at straws.\n\nImmediately before the race Chopper is called to the Surf Marshal's office where he finds Judge Dredd waiting for him. Dredd explains that his arrest was merely a ruse to settle 'other business'. He then informs Chopper \"You can race \u2013 No promises. But when you cross that line I'll be waiting. You've made fools of us too often, Shakespeare. This time, you try to escape... I'll have to kill you.\"\n\nWhat follows is a race of epic proportions. Halfway through disaster strikes when Jug Mckenzie clips Choppers board sending the two favourites crashing out of the race. Seemingly with their chances of winning totally ruined, both Mckenzie and Chopper surf like they never have before and by the time they hit the home stretch they are neck to neck, but McKenzie wins by less than an inch. Chopper is left stunned, in total disbelief that he lost. As Dredd moves in for the arrest, Chopper turns to Jug and congratulates the defending champion, telling him \"You're the tops, Jug \u2013 Number one.\" Dredd raises his gun and calls for Chopper's surrender, but Chopper refuses, and slowly surfs away making no attempt at a quick getaway and giving Dredd plenty of opportunity to fire. But Dredd hesitates and is then struck from behind by Jug McKenzie, allowing Chopper to make a getaway into the Radback (Radioactive Outback \u2013 the Oz equivalent of the Cursed Earth).\n\nA month later and Chopper is living rough in the desert living off [[kangaroo]] meat and still bitter about losing Supersurf 10. On a supply run to the city Chopper attempts to re-run the race course, but realises it's pointless. As he sits on his board eating a 'snagger' that was donated to him by the owner of a market, Chopper is approached by a lone surfer who turns out to be Jug McKenzie. McKenzie cleans Chopper up and gives him new clothes and a friendship is struck up between the former rivals, but all Chopper is interested in is a rematch. This time Chopper wins and he returns to the Radback leaving behind him a new friendship and a new love interest \u2013 Charlene.\n\nNews of Supersurf 11 reached Chopper just before the death of Smokie, a grumpy old aborigine who had taken Chopper under his wing. Before he died Smokie had told Chopper that he should follow his '[[songline]]' and take part in the race. Following Smokie's death Chopper headed towards the City and met up with Jug McKenzie and Charlene and on a flight chartered specifically for the Oz surfers, headed towards Mega-City Two, where the contest was now to be held. Controversy first struck Supersurf 11 when during a parade of the surfers fireworks were set off killing several of the surfers. It was claimed that this was a publicity event by the new sponsors, StigCorp, though the company denied it. The credibility of these denials were weakened when Stig \u2013 the head of StigCorp \u2013 publicly announced intentions for Supersurf 11; The route was to be littered with snipers and missile launchers and napalm. It was to be more of a bloodbath than a race. Up in arms over this outrage, the surfers refused to race on principle until 16-year-old Sonny Williams from Brit-Cit signed up to the race. Not one to shy away from a challenge, and also because the Jug Mckenzie he'd beaten in a rematch was a Mckenzie past his prime, Chopper signed up too. In the days leading up to race day 39 other surfers entered the contest. On the morning of the race a drunk Jug Mckenzie claimed he was going to race in response to his critics calling him a coward and over the hill. Chopper stopped him by locking him in a cupboard. Before the race Chopper was involved in an altercation with Sonny Williams. Chopper could see the kid was scared so infuriated him as to get the young surfers adrenaline pumping and thus giving him a better chance of getting through the first few yards. Within moments of the race starting a shell burst amongst the pack blowing the head of Dallas Hall (who came third in Supersurf 10) clean off her shoulders and embedding a part of her skull in Chopper's left arm, rendering it dead. As the race went on, the bodies dropped frequently until there were only a handful of surfers left, with Chopper in the lead. As Chopper left one of the final obstacles, he was brutally gunned down from hidden machine gun emplacements. Charlene, who had been watching the race on television, left her hotel to be with her fallen lover's body. Chopper regained consciousness and struggled to his feet making his way to one of the gun emplacements where he attacked one of the gunners and using his machine gun killed the other machine gunner. But his efforts were too late as the gunners had already claimed their third victim \u2013 Sonny Williams. The surviving surfers pulled out of the race, but Chopper, knowing that it was too late for him, got back on his board and headed towards the final obstacle \u2013 Stig.  Chopper approached Stig, who, although blind, was to act as a sniper near the finish line. Curious as to why Chopper wasn't making an effort to avoid his gun, Stig doesn't fire and Chopper throws a grenade which he took off one of the machine gunners, killing Stig and his assistant. Chopper turns his board towards the finish line but he soon succumbs to his wounds and collapses on his board, laying lifeless inches from the finish as Charlene runs to where his board hovers.\n\nChopper survived and retired to the Radback, joining Charlene and Jug in a dropout commune. But StigCorp caught up with him and destroyed the commune, killing WipeOut Jones who was visiting Chopper following his victory in Supersurf 12. Chopper and Jug make an almost suicidal assault on the Oz headquarters of StigCorp which leaves Moke Anderson (a survivor of Supersurf 11) dead.\n\nMany fans were upset when the story ''Earth Wind and Fire'' appeared in the first issue of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''. Many felt that Chopper surviving Supersurf 11 undermined the emotional impact of the finale of the ''Song Of The Surfer'' storyline. Especially for such a lacklustre story. [[Garth Ennis]], writer of ''Earth, Wind and Fire'', agreed that bringing Chopper back was a bad idea<ref>[http://viciousimagery.blogspot.com/2007_02_01_archive.html Vicious Imagery: February 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nWhen Jug Mckenzie died, Chopper was brought into touch with Jug's estranged daughter Mercy and her mother, Calista. After Mercy told Chopper about her mother being in trouble Chopper decided to return to Mega-City One for only the second time since he journeyed to Oz. Chopper soon found himself in the centre of a con conducted by Calista and Mercy which brought him face to face once again with his old nemesis, Judge Dredd. As always Chopper ended on top of the situation leaving Calista stewing in her defeat and returned to Oz and his job as a lifeguard.\n\nIn ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #302's \"Twenty Years to Midnight\", set in 2132, Chopper makes a background appearance on a talkshow. The teenagers in this story are unaware of who he is, and view the show as being for adults; the POV character believes Chopper looks tired and lost, looking at footage of \"when he used to matter\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*''The A-Z of Judge Dredd: The Complete Encyclopedia from Aaron Aardvark to Zachary Zziiz'' (by Mike Butcher, [[St. Martin's Press]], March 1999, {{ISBN|0-312-13733-8}})\n*[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/d/dredduni.htm Dredd's World] at the International Superheroes Catalogue\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Judge Dredd}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Judge Dredd Minor Characters, List Of}}\n[[Category:Judge Dredd characters|Minor Characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of comics characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{In-universe|date=October 2009}}\n{{TOC right}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' in the British comic strip '''''[[Judge Dredd]]''''' appearing in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' and related publications. They are listed alphabetically by surname, in categories. (Major characters have their own articles: see the navigation box at [[#References|the bottom of this article]].)\n\n==Judges of Mega-City One==\n{{Main|Judge (2000 AD)}}\n\n===Anderson===\nSee [[Judge Anderson]].\n\n===Beeny===\nBeeny is the child of the two main characters who appeared in the first ''[[America (Judge Dredd story)|America]]'' story, America Jara and Bennett Beeny. She herself first appeared briefly in the sequel to that story, but her first main story was the third in the ''America'' trilogy,<ref>\"Cadet,\" in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #250\u2013252, 2006</ref> in which she took a lead role.\n\nIn 2119 Beeny was enrolled as a cadet in the Academy of Law by her father just before his untimely death,<ref>\"America: Fading of the Light,\" in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #25, 1996</ref> and served well enough to qualify for the accelerated graduation program. In her tenth year, as with all tenth year cadets, she was required to plan and execute a criminal investigation on her own. Allowed to choose her supervisor, she chose to work with Judge Dredd.\n\nIn 2130 she graduated to full judge at age 15. In late 2137 Beeny and Dredd investigated a Total War terrorist cell which had assassinated a member of the Council of Five, [[Mega-City One]]'s highest legislative body. Following the arrest of the perpetrators, Dredd recommended that Beeny be appointed to the vacant Council seat, and [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] agreed.<ref>\"Terror Rising,\" in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #365\u2013367</ref> She was briefly removed from the Council in early 2141, when the entire Council was dismissed by the new chief judge, [[#Logan|Judge Logan]].<ref>\"Machine Law,\" in ''2000 AD'' #2118</ref> However, shortly afterwards Logan acknowledged that this had been a mistake, and he reinstated her.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2122</ref>\n\n===Castillo===\n'''Judge Laverne Castillo'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=CASTILLO Judge Castillo's profile on official ''2000AD '' website]</ref> was a [[Judge (2000 AD)|street judge]] who was taken off street duty when she froze in combat and allowed a fellow judge to be shot and seriously wounded. Transferred to administrative duties, she became the personal aide to Chief Judge McGruder and accompanied the Chief Judge on a diplomatic visit to the planet [[Outer planets of the Solar System in fiction#Comics|Hestia]]. When their spaceship crashed there, Castillo so impressed Judge Dredd that on their return home he recommended that she be transferred back to street duty.<ref>''2000 AD'' #892, 904\u2013914; ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #58\u201369</ref> This time she excelled in her chosen role, and was Dredd's [[sidekick]] in a number of stories until she was murdered in 2123 by aliens after eight years on the force.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #76\u201379</ref>\n\nDuring her time on Hestia, Castillo developed a secret and unrequited crush on Judge Dredd. Writer [[John Wagner]] never developed this theme any further with her character, but this idea was taken up again with the character [[Galen DeMarco]] and used to greater effect, with significant repercussions in the relevant stories.\n\n===Deacon===\n'''Judge Francesco Deacon''' was one of the first ever street judges, in the 2030s. Before becoming a judge he was in the military police.<ref>Carroll, M. (2018) ''Judges: The Avalanche'' [[Abaddon Books]], p. 57</ref> He first appeared in [[Michael Carroll (author)|Michael Carroll]]'s novel ''Judges: The Avalanche'', and simultaneously in the ''Judge Dredd'' comic strip story \"Paradigm Shift\" in ''2000&nbsp;AD'' #2082\u20132086 in May 2018, also written by Carroll and with art by [[Staz Johnson]].\n\n===Dekker===\n'''Judge Dekker'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=2000AD&choice=DEKKER Judge Dekker profile]</ref> first appeared in [[1984 in comics|1984]] as a [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|rookie judge]], being successfully evaluated by Dredd as to her suitability to become a full judge.<ref>''Judge Dredd'' (all by [[John Wagner]]/[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Kim Raymond]]):<br /> \"Super Bowl\" (in ''2000 AD'' #370\u2013371, 1984)<br /> \"Bingo\" (in ''2000 AD'' #372, 1984)<br /> \"The Making of a Judge\" (in ''2000 AD'' #373, 1984)</ref> She did not reappear in the strip again until [[1991 in comics|1991]], when writer [[Garth Ennis]] used her as a recurring secondary character in several 1991 and 1992 strips \u2013 most prominently as the investigating judge against the \"Muzak Killer\".<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"Muzak Killer\" (by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Dermot Power]], in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' #746\u2013748, 1991)</ref> By this time an experienced street judge, she was killed in the [[1992 in comics|1992]] story \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\" (set in 2114). Upon her death Dredd considered that she was ''\"...the best rookie he'd ever had, bar none.\"'' He later hallucinated her during his crucifixion in \"Goodnight Kiss\".\n\nAn alternative, evil version of Dekker from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] appeared in the [[1994 in literature|1994]] novel ''[[Dread Dominion]]''.<ref>''Dread Dominion'' ([[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]], May 1994 {{ISBN|0-352-32929-7}})</ref>\n\n===Dolman===<!-- This section is linked from [[Judge Dredd]] -->\n'''Dolman''' was a cadet at the Academy of Law. He was cloned from Judge Dredd's DNA. Although he performed well at the Academy, he resented his lack of control over his own life and chose to leave the Academy and Mega-City One.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1378\u20131381</ref> He joined the [[Space Corps (Judge Dredd)|Space Corps]] and was transferred to an offworld Academy, though he regularly returned to the city; keeping in touch with [[Vienna Dredd]] and took classes at night school.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' 260: \"Judge Dredd: Night School\"</ref>\n\nShortly after \"[[Day of Chaos]]\", Dolman returned to the city: he felt obliged to help out, especially with his family in danger.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1802\">''2000 AD'' #1802</ref> He was an advisor and non-combatant in the Corps by now, and first arrived in the city when Marines were asked to break the siege at Sue Perkins Block. Colonel Lynn Easter viewed him with mild contempt, especially when he tried to stop her bombing the block, but Dolman used his judge training to cripple a marine, forcing her to call off the airstrike, and then assist Dredd in stopping the siege. (For most of the story Dolman went unnamed, leaving his return a surprise.) He was injured in the process and sent to hospital, with Dredd calling him \"a judge\" over Dolman's protests.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1792\u20131796: \"Judge Dredd: Debris\"</ref> The Corps were left angry that Dolman had shot a marine \u2013 a decision Dredd agreed with \u2013 and Easter and two others assaulted him in hospital, but Dolman was able to take them down.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1802\" />\n===Dredd===\nSee [[Judge Dredd (character)|Judge Dredd]]\n===Fargo===\n'''Chief Judge Eustace Fargo''' was the first chief judge of Mega-City One (and indeed of the entire United States, before it was divided) and the source of the DNA from which Judge Dredd was cloned. In the 1995 film ''Judge Dredd'' Fargo was played by [[Max von Sydow]].\n\nAlmost every appearance of Fargo in the comic has been a flashback, since he was believed to have died in 2051, decades before the stories in the comic. However in 2006\u201307 the story ''[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]'', written by [[John Wagner]], described a [[secret history]] in which Fargo's death had been faked and he had survived in suspended animation until 2129.\n\nAs a result of a massive increase in violent gang crime, US president Thomas Gurney appointed Fargo Special Prosecutor for Street Crime. When the Constitution was amended to allow the creation of an elite law enforcement agency to convict criminals without due process, Fargo was made the first \"chief judge\" in 2031. Fargo resigned and attempted suicide in 2051, but the matter was covered up by deputy chief judges [[#Solomon|Solomon]] and [[#Goodman|Goodman]], who fabricated a story that he had been killed in a drive by shooting. In fact he survived, and was placed in suspended animation until such time as medical science advanced to the point where his injuries could be fully healed. He was succeeded as chief judge by Solomon.\n\nIn 2070, after the Third World War devastated the United States, Fargo was revived, and he advised the chief judge \u2013 now Goodman \u2013 to overthrow [[#President Robert L. Booth|President Bob Booth]] and take over the government, which was done. Fargo survived an assassination attempt by [[#Judd|Morton Judd]], but his condition deteriorated and he was returned to suspended animation. Shortly afterwards he was kidnapped by Judd's men, and was thought lost forever. But in 2129 it was discovered that he was being held by terrorists in the Cursed Earth, and Judge Dredd led a team to rescue him. Fargo was revived, but he was beyond saving and died shortly afterwards.\n\n===Francisco===\n\n'''Judge Dan Francisco''' was chief judge of Mega-City One from 2131 to 2134, except for a brief period when he was deposed by his deputy, [[#Sinfield|Judge Sinfield]], from 2131 to 2132.\n\nBefore becoming chief judge, Francisco was a street judge and the subject of a 24-hour reality show called ''The Streets Of Dan Francisco'' \u2013 a major public relations boost for Justice Department. In 2131 Judges [[#Sinfield]], Cardew and Millan began a campaign to run Francisco as a candidate to replace [[Judge Hershey]] as chief judge, running on an [[Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)|anti-mutant]] platform.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1628</ref> He won by a landslide.\n\n[[Tour of Duty (Judge Dredd story)|Mutant townships]] in the [[Cursed Earth]] were set up, to which to expel the mutant citizens. Francisco also had Hershey and Dredd given new postings, off-world and in the townships respectively, until the mutant issue died down; how much of this was his own idea and how much was Sinfield's remained ambiguous.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1649</ref>\n\nSinfield dosed Francisco with a powerful hypnotic drug, persuaded him to resign,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1666\u20131667 and #2010</ref> and succeeded him as acting chief judge.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1674 and 1677</ref> Both Dredd and the mayor were left confused and suspicious by Francisco's sudden collapse in confidence and by his support of Sinfield. This eventually led to an investigation, and Sinfield's crime was uncovered. Sinfield was arrested, and Francisco returned to office. Francisco appointed Dredd to the Council of Five.\n\nIn 2134 Dredd learned of a terrorist plot to infect Mega-City One with a deadly pathogen. Dredd recommended a ground assault on the terrorist's camp, but Francisco overruled him and ordered an air strike. Consequently the fact that it wasn't the real camp was not discovered until it was too late, and Mega-City One was infected. By the time the disease was contained, 350 million people had been killed (out of an initial population of around 400 million), and Francisco resigned in shame of \"presiding over the [[Day of Chaos|worst disaster in our history]]\". He appointed Judge Hershey as his successor.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1789</ref>\n\n===Gerhart===\n\n'''SJS Judge Alex Gerhart''' was Dredd's interrogator when a Tek-Division scientist was murdered. He used the opportunity to pressure Dredd about whether he felt guilty for [[Day of Chaos|Chaos Day]], knowing it was revenge for his own destruction of East-Meg Two.<ref>Prog 1799: \"Innocence Part 2\"</ref> Gerhart himself did feel Dredd was responsible. When their paths next crossed, he was hospitalised saving Dredd from a missile attack: he intends to one day arrest the man and put him on trial for Chaos Day.<ref>Prog 1836</ref>\n\nIn 2136, Gerhart was sent with Dredd and [[Space Corps (comics)|a marine squad]] to investigate a potential uprising on the Titan penal colony.\n\nIn 2140 he resigned and took the Long Walk.<ref>Progs 2073\u20132074</ref>\n\nGerhart was murdered by insane SJS Judge Pin in 2141 for being a close associate of Dredd.\n\n===Giant===\n'''Judge Giant''' can refer to either of two characters. They are father and son. Their first names have never been given.\n\nThey are both descended from another ''2000 AD'' character, 'Giant' (real name John Clay), who starred in his own series in ''2000 AD'', ''[[Harlem Heroes]],'' which ran in progs (issues) 1\u201327 of the comic. '''John 'Giant' Clay''' made a [[cameo appearance]] in the ''Judge Dredd'' strip in prog 28. Since Judge Dredd himself did not appear in ''2000 AD'' until prog 2, the Giant family's appearance in the comic predates Dredd's debut in his own strip.\n\n====Judge Giant Snr====\nThe original Judge Giant first appeared in prog 27 of the comic ([[1977 in comics|1977]]) as a rookie [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge]] who had just graduated from the Academy of Law. Set in 2099, his first appearance in \"The Academy of Law\" (progs 27\u201328) was a [[2000 AD crossovers|crossover]] with ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', set decades after the events depicted in that series. It featured a cameo appearance by his father, John 'Giant' Clay, as a very old man at the end of the story. \"The Academy of Law\" is also notable for the debut of another important supporting character, [[#Griffin|Judge Griffin]], as well as the Academy of Law itself. It tells of Rookie Giant's [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|Final Assessment]], a gruelling test of his judgement and abilities to determine his suitability for promotion to full judge. His supervisor is Judge Dredd, who passes him.\n\nJudge Giant became Dredd's [[sidekick]] for the next four years. His most important story was the 23-episode [[#Chief Judge Cal|Judge Cal]] storyline, in which he first saved Dredd from being executed and then fought with him against Cal's renegade judges and alien mercenaries (Kleggs) until the end. Although he had an important role in that story, his appearances in later tales were generally little more than mere cameos, and his importance within the strip tailed off somewhat. He was finally killed off in the \"[[Block Mania]]\" story (1981) while trying to arrest [[Orlok the Assassin|Orlok]] just before the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]]. The unheroic circumstances of his death (he was shot in the back in a brief scene) were controversial among fans, since although they were used to seeing popular characters killed off in ''2000 AD'', they were disappointed with the cursory way in which Giant's death was depicted. In an interview years later, writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] said: \"When we wrote the death of Giant, I thought it was a great idea to kill him off in such a casual, natural (for a judge) way. But when the reader outcry came, I was startled and forced to see things from their point of view.\"<ref>[http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant4.shtml Alan Grant interview from January 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516041824/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant4.shtml |date=2006-05-16}}</ref>\n\n====Judge Giant Jnr====\nIn 1989 the story \"Young Giant\"<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"Young Giant\" (by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]], in ''2000 AD'' #651\u2013655, 1989)</ref> established that the original Judge Giant had fathered a child in 2101, something prohibited to judges. Orphaned when his mother was murdered in front of him shortly after the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]] in 2104, Giant's son had been inducted into the Academy of Law, where he performed extremely well but with a worrying streak of violence that threatened his ability as a judge. With Dredd's help, Giant was able to get past his deep-rooted anger and brought his mother's killer to justice.\n\nUnlike his father, who became a full judge in his first story, Cadet Giant remained a cadet for five years during his recurring appearances in the strip. He was a major protagonist in one of Judge Dredd's biggest and most significant epics, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\", even taking over the lead role from Dredd himself in half a dozen episodes (including two in which Dredd did not even appear).<ref>''2000 AD'' #688\u2013693</ref> He led a group of cadets who remained free of Dark Judge control and, at one point, were personally hunted down by [[#Dark Judges|Judge Mortis]]. He would later be one of the first people to battle Sabbat's zombies during [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]. Eventually he became the youngest cadet ever to graduate from the Academy, at the age of fifteen, having been fast-tracked. In a story reminiscent of his father's debut, Giant's Final Assessment was conducted by Judge Dredd, who passed him as fit to become a judge in 2116.<ref>''Judge Dredd:'' \"Giant\" (by John Wagner and Ian Gibson, in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 2 no. 50-52, 1994)</ref>\n\nThe new Judge Giant has made several appearances since, and actually saved the whole world from a deadly virus in 2117.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 2 no. 83</ref> He is apparently one of the best judges in [[Mega-City One]], although he has not featured in any story to the extent that he did in \"Necropolis\".\n\n(In a six-page one-off story in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #216 called \"Whatever Happened to John 'Giant' Clay?\" (2004),<ref>''Whatever Happened To...?'': \"John 'Giant' Clay\", by [[Gordon Rennie]] and [[Rufus Dayglo]], in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #216 (2004) (reprinted in supplement to ''Megazine'' #388).</ref> Judge Giant met his grandfather for the first time. The original Giant had not appeared in any story since 1978, and this story ended with his death from old age.)\n\n===Goodman===\n'''Chief Judge Clarence Goodman''' was Mega-City One's longest serving chief judge, and the first to appear in the comic. He was in the first ever episode of ''Judge Dredd'' in prog 2 (March 1977), although not named until prog 86. He was assassinated in prog 89, but returned in flashbacks in the story ''[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]'' (2006\u201307).\n\nGoodman was deputy chief judge of the United States, first under [[#Fargo|Chief Judge Fargo]] and then under [[#Solomon|Chief Judge Solomon]]. In 2052 each American mega-city ran its own justice department, and Goodman was deputy chief judge of [[Mega-City One]], succeeding Solomon as chief judge in 2058. In 2070, after [[#President Robert L. Booth|President Robert Booth]] started a nuclear war which devastated America, Goodman overthrew the president and Congress and took over the city; the other mega-cities became independent.\n\nThirty years later Goodman was assassinated by Judge Quincy and others, on the orders of his own deputy, [[#Chief Judge Cal|Judge Cal]].\n\n===Greel===\n'''Tek-Judge Todd Greel''' was head of Tek-Division, and he personally took over the [[Mechanismo]] robot judge project after the project's previous heads, Stitch and Quiggley, were disgraced. In 2116 Greel compelled Stich to give evidence against Dredd for having illegally destroyed a Mark II robot to sabotage their field test, which resulted in Dredd being convicted and sent to the penal colony on Titan. Immediately afterwards, Greel was briefly acting chief judge. However he was implicated in an assassination attempt on [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] when one of his Mark IIA robots attempted to kill her and she had to be saved by Dredd while ''en route'' to Titan. Although Greel's alleged guilt was never proved, McGruder curtly demoted him to a junior position in Traffic Control, effectively finishing his political ambitions for ever. The Mechanismo programme was aborted, and Dredd was pardoned.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #57; ''2000 AD'' #891\u2013894; 904\u2013915</ref> Greel was succeeded as head of Tek-Division by Judge McGovern and then [[#McTighe|Judge McTighe]].<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #40, 52\u201355</ref> Greel later appeared in ''[[The Pit (Judge Dredd story)|The Pit]]'', running Traffic Station Alamo in the North-West Habzone: enforcing petty restrictions on other judges, his only remaining power.\n\n===Griffin===\n'''Judge J\u00fcrgen Griffin''' first appeared in prog 27 in a story by John Wagner and Ian Gibson. He was Principal of the Academy of Law, and had taught Dredd when he was a cadet. When the insane [[#Chief Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]] seized control of Mega-City One, Griffin and other Academy tutors joined Dredd's resistance movement. Griffin was one of only two of these tutors who was still alive by the time Cal was overthrown; the other was [[#Pepper|Judge-Tutor Pepper]]. Dredd declined to succeed Cal as chief judge and nominated Griffin for the office. Griffin was elected chief judge by acclamation, and appointed Pepper as deputy chief judge.\n\nGriffin was captured by the enemy during the [[Apocalypse War]] in 2104, and brainwashed into supporting their propaganda campaign. Dredd judged it impossible to rescue him, and so he assassinated him instead, during a live television broadcast.\n\n===Herriman===\n'''Deputy Chief Judge Paul Herriman''' was originally a [[Judge (2000 AD)|street judge]] and had worked in every major division of Justice Department. He saw himself as a conciliator, preferring to operate by consensus.<ref>Prog 916: \"The Candidates Part 1\"</ref> In 2116, he was one of the senior judges who tried to pressure [[Chief Judge McGruder|Judge McGruder]] into reinstating the Council of Five, in order to have the power to remove her.\n\nAfter McGruder stood down, Herriman was one of the candidates in the election to replace her. Running against Judges Dredd, [[#Volt|Volt]] and [[Judge Hershey|Hershey]], Herriman came third. Chief Judge Volt appointed Herriman deputy chief judge. In 2117 Herriman became the first deputy chief judge to regularly preside over meetings of the ruling Council of Five following Volt's decision to abolish the chief judge's ''ex officio'' chairmanship of the Council.\n\nHerriman was assassinated by [[#Dark Judges|Judge Mortis]] in 2120 while he was acting chief judge and his corpse was used as Mortis's vessel. He was succeeded as deputy chief judge by [[Judge Hershey]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #915\u2013918; ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 3 #52\u201355; ''Batman vs. Judge Dredd: Die Laughing'' graphic novel (1998)</ref>\n\n===Hershey===\n'''Judge Barbara Hershey''' first appeared in ''[[The Judge Child]]'' in 1980, in an episode written by [[John Wagner]] and drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. For nearly two decades she regularly appeared as Dredd's junior colleague, before being promoted to become his superior in 1999; she was chief judge twice. She also had her own solo series, ''Judge Hershey'', in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' (1992\u20131997).<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=hershey Judge Hershey] at 2000 AD online</ref> In the 1995 film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', Hershey is played by [[Diane Lane]].\n\nShortly after her graduation from the Academy of Law in 2102 at age eighteen,<ref>''2000 AD'' #162; 1178</ref> [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]] Hershey joined the crew of the spaceship ''Justice 1'' for the dangerous deep-space mission to find the [[Judge Child]], who had been abducted by the Angel Gang. Two years later, during the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]], Hershey was called upon again by Judge Dredd to join his \"Apocalypse Squad\" for a daring commando raid which ended the war.<ref>''2000 AD'' #263\u2013270</ref>\n\nWhen [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] resigned her position in 2108, she appointed  Hershey as the youngest ever member of the Council of Five, Mega-City One's highest legislative body.<ref>''2000 AD'' #457</ref> Her meteoric rise up the Justice Department's \"greasy pole\" saw her hotly tipped to become chief judge in due course, but she denied any real ambitions in this direction.<ref name=\"Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 2 #53\">''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #53</ref> Even so, she soon experienced the power that goes with the office when she was asked to serve as acting chief judge while McGruder \u2013 back for an unprecedented second term of office \u2013 attended a crisis meeting of judges from all over the world to find a way to defeat [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Sabbat the Necromagus]] in 2114.<ref>''2000 AD'' #792</ref> Her sister Hillary, a civilian, was killed by Sabbat's zombies, leaving her son Anton, Barbara's nephew, an orphan. The following year, when Anton was kidnapped, Hershey rescued him.<ref>\"The Harlequin's Dance\", in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #37\u201340, 1993</ref>\n\nWhen McGruder resigned for the second time, in 2116, Hershey was one of the candidates to replace her, but she received only 13 votes from the 400 senior judges who voted. [[#Volt|Chief Judge Volt]] appointee her to the new Council of Five, and in 2120 she became deputy chief judge. The following year she became acting chief judge following the suicide of Volt at the end of the [[The Doomsday Scenario|Second Robot War]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #1167</ref> In 2122 she was elected chief judge in her own right, trouncing the only other candidate, Judge Loblaw.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1178</ref>\n\nIn 2130 she repealed the [[Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)|anti-mutant laws]] (largely at Dredd's insistence), making her unpopular with the public and many judges.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2008 and 1569\u201375</ref> In the following year senior judges began a campaign to have her voted out of office and replaced with a hardline candidate who would reinstate those laws.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1628</ref> [[#Francisco|Judge Dan Francisco]] won the election by a landslide,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1633</ref> and appointed Hershey to a position on another planet.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1649</ref> At over nine years, Hershey had the longest reign (2122\u20132131) of any chief judge since [[#Goodman|Clarence Goodman]], and the longest since the comic strip began in 1977. Dredd described her as \"the best chief judge we've ever had.\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #1632</ref>\n\nAfter two years away from Earth, Hershey returned to Mega-City One and resumed her old role as a street judge. In the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]'', set in 2134, a deadly plague wiped out seven eighths of the city's population. Francisco resigned and appointed Hershey to form an interim government.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1789</ref>\n\nIn 2139 Hershey reintroduced the Mechanismo robot judges, the failure of which had ended Chief Judge McGruder's career 23 years earlier. Her efforts to win Dredd over failed.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2024\u20132029</ref>\n\nIn 2141 Hershey decided to step down for a second time, and nominated [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Logan|Judge Logan]] as her successor.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2115</ref> Publicly she retired due to desire to move on from the top post, but in private she had concealed a terminal illness contracted during her time off world and had managed to hide it from all but her doctors.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2119</ref> Hershey was the third longest serving chief judge (after [[Chief Judge Fargo|Fargo]] and [[Judge Goodman|Goodman]]), having held office for a total of sixteen years.\n\nSeveral months later, with no signs of improvement, Hershey asked to be euthanized.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2150</ref> This story, \"Guatemala,\" was published in September 2019, 39 years after the character's first appearance. In later episodes of the same story, it was revealed that Hershey had had another sister (not named in the story), who lived in [[Guatemala]]. As this sister was unable to have children, Hershey had donated her eggs, and so the resulting child and grandchildren were genetically Judge Hershey's own. Years later, Guatemala was taken over in a coup and Hershey's sister was murdered. Hershey's last request to Dredd was for him to go there and rescue her surviving relatives from danger.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2154 and 2157</ref> Dredd later infiltrated Guatemala under the guise of a diplomatic mission, located the family and was able to rescue Hershey's daughter, granddaughter and unborn great granddaughter; however her grandson was killed in the operation. The family were returned to Mega-City One to live under Justice Department protection.\n\nHershey's death was not as it seemed however and was infact faked. Hershey believed she had been poisoned by her enemies and that a cure existed somewhere. She faked her death in order to retire and leave the city to hunt down the agents of former black ops chief Judge Smiley who she believed was responsible for her illness and held the cure.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2175</ref>\n\n===Janus===\n'''Judge Judy Janus''' is a member of Psi Division, Justice Department's unit of judges with psionic powers. She is portrayed as a young and ditzy [[psychic]] (she is a [[Precognition|precog]] and [[Telepathy|telepath]]). The character was created by [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] and first appeared in prog 842 in the story ''Inferno'' (1993). She later appeared in her own [[eponym]]ous strip, ''Janus: Psi Division'' (1993\u20131997),<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=2000AD&choice=JANUS List of Judge Janus stories] at Barney</ref> and in [[Dave Stone]]'s 1995 novel ''[[Wetworks (Judge Dredd novel)|Wetworks]]''.<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=Specials&choice=JANUS Barney]</ref>\n\n===Lamia===\n'''Exorcist-Judge Miryam Lamia''' was killed in action and then returned from the dead in circumstances that have not been explained. This experience left her with the unwanted ability to see and speak with the ghosts of the dead, and bizarre patterned markings on her body. Although communicating with the dead initially helped her to solve cases, she became unable to cope with constantly seeing ghosts, as there were so many of them, and she became a recluse, spending most of her time secluded in a room which the dead could not enter. She first appeared in prog 1640.<ref>''2000AD'' progs 1640\u20131643; 2069</ref>\n\n===Logan===\n\n'''Judge Logan''' is chief judge of [[Mega-City One]] (as of December 2019).\n\nLogan first appeared as Dredd's assistant in the 2003 story \"The Satanist,\" a role he held for nine years. During this period he appeared in the \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#Total War|Total War]]\" storyline (2004) and in \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" (2006\u201307). In \"Origins\" he was severely wounded in action and required major surgery, including an artificial lung, arm and spleen.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1535 and 1542, 2007</ref> In \"[[Tour of Duty (Judge Dredd story)|Tour of Duty]]\" (2009\u201310) he was promoted to senior judge.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1689</ref> Shortly afterwards he personally discovered the evidence which resulted in [[#Sinfield|Chief Judge Sinfield's]] conviction and removal from office in 2132.<ref>''2000'' AD #1693</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Day of Chaos]]\" (2011\u201312) he again lost his arm in an encounter with [[Dark Judges|Judge Mortis]] and was hospitalised.<ref>''2000'' AD #1782\u201383</ref> He received a prosthetic arm.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2116</ref>\n\nLogan was not seen again (except in a cameo) until \"Machine Law\" in 2019, in which it was revealed that he had become the sector house chief in Sector 6 in 2139.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2115</ref> In that same story, set in 2141, he succeeded [[Judge Hershey]] as Chief Judge, with Dredd's endorsement. He immediately appointed a [[Mechanismo|robot judge]] to the Council of Five, Mega-City One's ruling body, causing Dredd to have misgivings about him.<ref>''2000 AD'' #2118</ref> However, he eventually realised he had tried to go too far too soon.\n\n===Maitland===\n\n'''Judge Maitland''' is a judge working for Accounts. She first appeared in \"The Bean Counter\" (prog 1790), the first strip after ''[[Day of Chaos]]'', where she had a 'meeting' with Dredd in the middle of a riot because he would not come to her office. A highly lethal combatant, in mid-battle she berated Dredd for his contempt towards divisions like Accounts and his lack of paperwork, pointing out the necessity of \"bean counters\" like her to keep Justice Department functioning.\n\nIn \"[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|The Cold Deck]],\" she reported to Chief Judge Hershey about the city's crippled finances and advised nationalising the banks that had collapsed, then reclaiming their capital retroactively. Unknown to either of them, she was part of Dredd and Judge Smiley's team investigating Judge Bachmann: after tracking Black Ops' funds to Overdrive Inc, she was mindwiped so that Bachmann would not find out that he had recruited her. Her memory was returned when Black Ops' coup started, as Bachmann's office was right next to Accounts; she was able to rescue a wounded Dredd, patch him up, and hold off Black Ops agents until help arrived. After the coup was stopped, Dredd apologised for doubting her work in Accounts.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1809\u20131812</ref> She was subsequently promoted to head of Accounts Division, as the previous head (and \"72.342%\" of the division) had been killed in Bachmann's coup.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #336</ref>\n\n===McGruder===\n\n'''Chief Judge Hilda Margaret McGruder''' was chief judge of Mega-City One from 2104 to 2108 and again from 2112 to 2116.\n\nAfter the death of the insane [[#Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], McGruder was appointed to eliminate corruption from the discredited Special Judicial Squad. She was head of the SJS from 2101 to 2104.<ref>''2000 AD'' #182; 270</ref>\n\nShe led the resistance to the invading forces during the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]] after [[#Griffin|Chief Judge Griffin]] was killed and Judge Dredd was taken prisoner. As the only surviving member of the Council of Five after the war, she became chief judge by default.<ref>''2000 AD'' #270</ref> In her first term she established herself as one of the city's most able rulers as she set about rebuilding the war-torn city.<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\">''2000 AD'' #457</ref>\n\nShe resigned after four years in office, blaming herself for a massacre she thought she could have prevented (although most of her colleagues were more forgiving and begged her to stay), and took [[the Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|the Long Walk]] into the [[Cursed Earth]]. (Her final act in office was to dismiss all of the senior judges who disagreed with her decision to resign, saying this proved they had poor judgement.) She was succeeded as chief judge by [[#Silver|Thomas Silver]].<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\" />\n\nHer years in the Cursed Earth had had a damaging effect on her mental health, leaving her with a volatile temper, cruder mannerisms, and multiple personality syndrome as she began referring to herself using the [[royal we]] and arguing with herself.<ref name=\"2000 AD #706\">''2000 AD'' #706</ref> She ran into Dredd during the [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]] crisis and returned with him to fight the [[Dark Judges]]. With Silver missing and presumed dead, she subsequently returned to the office of chief judge.<ref>''2000 AD'' #699</ref>\n\nHer first task was to once more get the city and Judge force back on their feet, as well as to deal with all the dead. She decided not to appoint a Council of Five, but instead take advice from any and all Senior Judges when the time came; in an early such discussion, on Dredd's advice, she agreed to a public referendum over whether the Judges should continue to rule the city.\n\nHer second term became increasingly beset with doubts about the quality of her leadership and her sanity. To cover up the losses of Judges from the recent crises, she began a programme of [[Mechanismo|robot judges]] which went disastrously wrong. However, she kept trying to revive the Mechanismo project despite clear evidence it was unworkable, and without a formal body like the Council of Five there was no way to oppose her if she would not listen to advice. In 2116 a deputation of senior judges, including Dredd, attempted to persuade her to reform the Council (with a view to then removing her from office), but they were unsuccessful, partly as she realised they would try to do away with her.<ref>''2000 AD'' #891</ref>\n\nHer final attempt to revive Mechanismo caused the robots themselves to try and assassinate her. By this point, Dredd was under arrest for his unlawful attempts to stop the project and McGruder's growing madness had embarrassed her on a tour of the colony world Hestia. When the assassination attempt was uncovered, and when Dredd was the sole reason she (and others) survived it, she pardoned him, scrapped the project, and agreed to stand down from office.<ref>''2000 AD'' #915</ref> She was succeeded by [[#Volt|Judge Volt]].\n\nDeclining to take the Long Walk again, she became a civilian and decided to write her memoirs. In her retirement she developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and her mental health rapidly deteriorated even further.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 3 #9</ref> When Judge Dredd heard that she had been scheduled for compulsory [[euthanasia]] he abducted her and led her to a more honourable death fighting criminals in the Cursed Earth.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1009</ref> The facts of her death were covered up.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1167</ref>\n\nA Mega-City One battleship and a street were named after her in her honour.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1033; 1504</ref>\n\n===McTighe===\n'''Tek-Judge McTighe''' was head of Tek Division. He is the longest-serving head of Tek-Division to appear in the comic, as that office usually tends to have a high rate of turnover. He succeeded Judge McGovern in 2120, and joined the [[Council of Five]] shortly afterwards, following the death of [[#Herriman|Judge Herriman]].<ref>''Megazine'' vol. 3 #40, 52\u201355</ref> During the mutant rights vote, Dredd said McTighe was a \"yes man\" who would vote the way Chief Judge Hershey told him.<ref>''2000 AD'' Prog 2008</ref>\n\nHe resigned from the Council in 2131, following the deposing of Hershey;<ref name=\"2000 AD #1649\">''2000 AD'' #1649 </ref> he was not invited back when Niles and Buell were.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1700</ref> He remained in charge of Tek Division. Following the events of Chaos Day, McTighe was left despondent, believing they had failed to protect the citizens.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1798</ref>\n\nHe was assassinated in ''2000 AD'' #1940 (2015), in a story set in 2137. It was revealed in #1943 that he had been re-appointed to the Council of Five at some point since the events in the story ''Trifecta''.\n\n===Morphy===\n'''Judge Morphy''' was the senior judge who supervised Dredd's [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|Final Assessment]] to become a full judge, when Dredd was a [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|rookie]] in 2079. During most of Dredd's career he mentored him, giving advice when needed, and was in many ways a father figure to him. He was killed in the line of duty in 2112, only a few months short of retirement. Dredd took his death very badly and almost murdered one of the killers, restraining himself only at the very last moment. The perpetrators were sentenced to thirty years.<ref>''2000 AD'' #387, 662\u2013668, 775</ref>\n\nA recurring joke in the series is that Dredd always wears the wrong sized boots. This can actually be traced to Morphy's first appearance,<ref>''2000 AD'' #387</ref> where Dredd confided to his former supervisor that he'd been experiencing doubts about the job. Morphy advised him to requisition a pair of boots two sizes too small: \"You'll be so busy cussin' those damned boots you won't have time to worry about anything else.\"\n\n===Niles===\n\nNiles was head of the Special Judicial Squad (internal affairs) until 2122, when [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] made him head of the Public Surveillance Unit. [[#Sinfield|Chief Judge Sinfield]] briefly replaced him as head of PSU with Judge Benedetto; Niles was reinstated by Chief Judge Francisco. When Judge Dredd ran against Sinfield in an election, Niles was Dredd's campaign manager. Niles was killed when the Statue of Judgement, which contained PSU headquarters, was destroyed by terrorists in 2134, after 22 years in the comic.\n\n===Nixon===\n'''Judge Aimee Nixon''' was a corrupt undercover judge. She was eventually arrested and sentenced to 20 years on the Titan penal colony. She was the original lead character in the series ''[[Low Life (comics)|Low Life]]'', until that position was taken by [[Dirty Frank (comics)|Dirty Frank]] and she became a supporting character.\n\n===Oldham===\n\n'''Judge Oldham''' was a street judge and irritant for Dredd in several Al Ewing strips. He was a bullying, reactionary judge with a streak of incompetence. In his first appearance he wanted to break a siege with extreme force despite the risk to hostages.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1611</ref> Then, when part of the security at the World Sex Championships, he shirked his duties to bully the competitors claiming he was \"keeping the deviants in line\", and allowed a gunman in.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1636</ref> Oldham and Dredd do not like each other. In his first appearance, Oldham implied Dredd was being \"soft\" due his mutant sympathies.\n\nDredd recommended that Oldham be moved to meat-wagon duties. Instead, Oldham was made a Senior Judge under [[Judge Sinfield]] and given authority over the older Judge Giant, as a rebuke to Dredd's old ally. During this time, he shot an unarmed mutant and showed no concern.<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #292</ref> When Sinfield was deposed, Giant became the dominant partner and tried to turn Oldham around. Despite some progress, Oldham made some basic mistakes in an operation and was shot dead by an escaped killer.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1720\u201321 and 1723</ref>\n\n===Omar===\n'''Psi-Judge Omar''' became head of [[Psi Division]] after his predecessor Ecks was killed in the [[Apocalypse War]]. He personally assisted Judge Dredd in his investigation into the haunting of a sector house,<ref>''2000 AD'' #359\u2013363</ref> and later he exonerated [[Judge Anderson]] when she was accused of negligently permitting the [[Dark Judges]] to escape and threaten the city.<ref>''2000 AD'' #427</ref> When psi-criminal Shojun the Warlord unleashed the demonic Seven Samurai on the city, Omar volunteered to sacrifice his own life in a suicide attack to destroy them using a psionic amplifier.<ref>''2000 AD'' #455</ref> He was succeeded as head of Psi-Division by [[Judge Shenker]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #457</ref>\n\n===Pepper===\n'''Judge Pepper''' was deputy chief judge from 2101 to 2103, succeeding DCJ [[#Grampus|Grampus]].<ref>''2000 AD'' #108, 201</ref>\n\nAfter losing a leg in the 21st century he retired from active service and became a tutor at the Academy of Law, where he taught many of the city's most important and senior judges while they were cadets, including teaching Applied Leadership to both [[Judge Dredd]] and future chief judge [[#Cal|Cal]]. When Chief Judge Cal became insane Pepper volunteered to fight with Dredd to depose the tyrant. In the moment of victory Dredd was offered the position of chief judge, but he declined in favour of [[#Griffin|Judge Griffin]]. Griffin then appointed Pepper as his deputy.<ref>''2000 AD'' #89\u2013108</ref>\n\nTwo years later Pepper was assassinated by game show contestants from a [[reality television]] show, in which contestants gained points by confessing to crimes they had not yet been caught for. Pepper's death led to the show being taken off the air.<ref>''2000 AD'' #201</ref> An artist oversight in this story saw him die with the full complement of two legs.\n\n===Perrier===\n'''Judge Perrier''' first appeared in the story \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", fighting the Sovs at the frontline. She did not appear again until years later when writer Garth Ennis took over the strip and brought her back in \"A Clockwork Pineapple\". She was then killed off in \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", swarmed by zombies before she could reach the city.\n\n===Pin===\n'''SJS Judge Bela Pin''' was an elderly judge who after suffering a mental breakdown on Chaos Day began to murder judges who fail to meet up to her exacting standards, but who she is unable to punish through official channels. Blaming Dredd for the state of the city after Chaos Day she began a vindictive vendetta against him and his closest allies. She killed Judge Gerhart and seriously injured Dredd and Judge Maitland before Dredd was able to knock her into an open burial pit where she was eaten by rats.\n\n===Prager===\n'''Judge Prager''' is one of the judges who chose to take the [[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]] into the [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)|Undercity]] rather than the Cursed Earth. After four years he made his first appearance in prog 328, when he saved Judge Dredd who had been transformed into a werewolf.<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"[[Undercity (Judge Dredd)#Cry of the Werewolf|Cry of the Werewolf]]\" (by [[John Wagner]]/[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Steve Dillon]], in ''2000 AD'' #322\u2013328, 1983)</ref> He next appeared decades later to warn the judges of a new threat to the city from [[#Mr Bones|Bones]], but at the same time reveals he has been infected and transforms into a werewolf at each full moon. Declining the cure and in his wolf form, he helped Dredd defeat Bones' army and resumed his Undercity patrol.<ref>''Judge Dredd'': \"[[Undercity (Judge Dredd)#Out of the Undercity|Out of the Undercity]]\" (by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carl Critchlow]], in ''2000 AD'' #1313\u20131316, 2003)</ref>\n\n===Ramos===\n'''Judge Hoolio Ramos''' was head of Street Division on the [[Council of Five]] under [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]]. In 2130 he was sent to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in disgrace after Dredd uncovered crimes he had committed thirty years before, when he was part of a group of [[vigilante]] judges who had taken it upon themselves to execute criminals that the law could not legitimately touch. The truth about these crimes was suppressed, and the public told that Ramos was simply being moved to a new posting off-world.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1589\u20131595</ref>\n\n===Renga===\n\nOne of the four cadets involved in the \"[[The Hunting Party (Judge Dredd story)|Hunting Party]]\" storyline,<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=reprint&page=gnprofiles&choice=hunting Details of the ''Hunting Party'' trade paperback], ''2000 AD'' #1033\u20131049</ref> '''Renga''' had briefly worked undercover in a juve gang for [[Wally Squad]]; the experiences left him disgruntled and antisocial as well as sporting a gang tattoo (which was later removed). His attitude caused him to clash with Dredd while on a mission to locate the source of [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Dr. Bolt|Dr. Bolt's]] Dune Sharks. After a disastrous attempt to 'save' a Cursed Earth girl from a ritual (which meant the end of her community), it appeared that he was going to be expelled from the Academy. However, he distinguished himself when he was part of a group of Judges that was temporarily thrown back in time to Erie, Indiana during the start of the [[Atomic Wars]], as well as in the final clash against the Dune Sharks, and so Dredd gave him a second chance.\n\nAfter he graduated from the Academy, he was personally chosen by Dredd to assist in the Fargo mission in \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]].\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #1505</ref> He also appeared in the story \"The Scorpion Dance\".<ref>[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=reprint&page=gnprofiles&choice=scorpion Details of ''The Scorpion Dance'' trade paperback]</ref>\n\n===Rico===\n{{confused|Rico Dredd}}\n'''Rico''' is a street judge cloned from the same DNA as Dredd. Since Judges [[Judge Dredd (character)|Joe Dredd]] and Rico Dredd were cloned from the DNA of [[#Fargo|Chief Judge Fargo]] in 2066, at least eight further clones of the Fargo bloodline have been produced by the [[Mega-City One]] [[Judge (2000 AD)|Justice Department]].<ref>\"Sector House,\" ''2000 AD'' #1216</ref> The first of these to graduate from the Academy of Law was given his final street assessment by Joe Dredd in 2122. His original name was Dredd, so to avoid complication at dispatch, on receiving his [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|full eagle]] the clone took the surname Rico, in honour of the late Rico Dredd.<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" episode 3, ''2000 AD'' #1188</ref> He has no first name.<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" episode 1, ''2000 AD'' #1186</ref> During his first five years as a cadet, he had been in the Texas City academy of law, before returning to Mega-City One.\n\nAfter a short period with the traffic division, Rico was assigned to Sector 108, where he overcame his colleagues' resentment at his ancestry and hardline attitude, and proved himself to be a brave and resourceful judge.<ref>\"Sector House,\" ''2000 AD'' #1215\u20131222</ref> He has a strong bond with his clone brother Joe Dredd (although Dredd is old enough to be his father), and when the older man's living quarters were moved to the Grand Hall of Justice, Rico took over his apartment in Rowdy Yates Block.<ref>\"Leaving Rowdy,\" ''2000 AD'' #1280</ref>\n\nWhile serving in Sector 108 Rico had to have one of his lungs replaced with an artificial one following an injury in the line of duty.<ref>\"Sector House,\" ''2000 AD'' #1222</ref> Later he suffered a gunshot wound to the jaw, but has since had this replaced with a synthetic copy.<ref>\"Blood Trails,\" ''2000 AD'' #1440\u20131449</ref>\n\nWhen Mega-City One's [[Mutants (Judge Dredd storyline)|mutant]] citizens were exiled to townships in the [[Cursed Earth]], Rico was one of the judges sent to supervise them, under Dredd's command. When Dredd returned to the city he left Rico in charge.<ref>\"[[Tour of Duty (Judge Dredd story)|Tour of Duty]],\" ''2000 AD'' #1656 and #1690</ref> Rico led a contingent of mutant volunteers back to the city to help rebuild it following the disastrous events of the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]''.<ref>\"Day of Chaos,\" ''2000 AD'' #1789</ref><ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=RICO Judge Rico's ''2000 AD'' website profile]</ref>\n\n===Roffman===\n'''Judge Roffman'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=ROFFMAN Judge Roffman's profile]</ref> works in the Public Surveillance Unit. He originally served in the SJS in Sector 301, but was transferred to Street Division in Sector 303 after bugging his superior officer's office. Due to his inexperience he bungled a raid and inadvertently discharged his weapon, shooting and wounding another judge. Suspended from duty, his efforts to make amends (again by spying on his new commanding officer) backfired and almost resulted in the end of his career.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1101\u20131110</ref> Instead [[Judge Edgar]], head of PSU, recognised that his suspicious and devious character made him ideally suited to surveillance work, and she recruited him.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1125</ref>\n\nHe flourished in his new role, and continues to assist Judge Dredd in investigations, including tracking a possible rogue judge in ''Sector House'' and carrying out spy work in ''Lawcon''. He was also forcibly teamed up with [[Galen DeMarco]] during [[The Doomsday Scenario|the Second Robot War]], showing cowardice and amorality much to Galen's disgust. These flaws would later save the day at Lawcon, which was undergoing infiltration by [[shape-shifting]] genocidal aliens: when the infiltrators tried to draw him into a trap by calling for help, Roffman (unlike other law enforcers) simply ignored them, leaving him free and able to help expose the infiltration to Dredd later.\n\nHe distinguished himself years later in the search for the members of the [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#Total War|Total War]] terrorism organisation when they began detonating nuclear bombs around the city.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1408\u20131419</ref> Most of his appearances since then have shown him working remotely from PSU.\n\nRoffman was severely injured in 2134 when his office in PSU headquarters was destroyed during the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]'' (2012),<ref>''2000 AD'' #1775</ref> losing both his legs and his sphincter, which required artificial and clone-grown replacements. Dredd was quietly angry that Roffman had been moved to the head of the queue when hundreds of other judges were allowed to rot in hospital. Despite his feelings, in ''[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|The Cold Deck]]'' he turned to Roffman for help in finding stolen Justice Department data, without telling him what it was. Roffman was left horrified when he learnt it was a gold clearance file and that Dredd had failed to stop it being transferred,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1807</ref> and after he discovered the file contained a list of undercover judges, he reported it to Bachmann as it was \"too big\" to leave to Dredd.\n\n===Sanchez===\n'''Judge Sanchez''' was a newly graduated Judge when [[#Mr Bones|Mr. Bones]] released the [[Judge Dredd vs. Aliens|Incubus]] on Mega-City One. She fought alongside Dredd and Judge Giant in the defence of the Grand Hall of Justice but it appeared the strain would break her. However, the various perils (including being impregnated by the Incubus) helped mould her into a strong judge. Consequently, she was chosen as one of the team assisting Dredd in his mission to rescue Chief Judge Fargo from his kidnappers in the Cursed Earth (in the story \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\"). She states during this time that she is not sure she agrees with the Justice Department's policy of celibacy for Judges.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Shenker===\n'''Judge Shenker''' became head of Psi Division in 2108, and was at the same time appointed to the Council of Five by outgoing [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]]. In 2122 he was dismissed from the Council by [[Judge Hershey|Chief Judge Hershey]] because of the disappointing performance of his division, but he remains head of the division to this day.\n\n===Silver===\n\n'''Judge Thomas Silver''' was chief judge of Mega-City One between 2108 and 2112.\n\nHe began his career as a [[judge (2000 AD)|street judge]], serving during the Atomic War and the Second American Civil War. To his later shame, in the early 2070s he was one of the many judges who agreed with [[Morton Judd]]'s ideas of genetically altering the citizens to be more docile.<ref>''2000 AD'' # 560: \"Oz Part 15\"</ref> In 2096 he was wounded in action and compelled to retire from active service. He became principal lecturer in Applied Violence at the Academy of Law.<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\">''2000 AD'' #457</ref>\n\nIn 2108 [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] resigned and left the city on the [[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]. One of her final acts as chief judge was to appoint Silver to the Council of Five, the city's highest [[legislature]]. The Council unanimously chose Silver for the highest office.<ref name=\"2000 AD #457\" />\n\nSilver quickly proved to be the most right-wing, hardline chief judge the city had ever seen. In 2109 he ordered a crack-down on the [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)|Democracy movement]] (a loose affiliation of organisations dedicated to democratic reform ever since the Justice Department usurped the elected government of the United States in 2070), putting Judge Dredd in personal charge of a secret campaign to smear the protest groups' leaders and to sabotage their efforts at peaceful demonstration. Undercover judges placed among the protesters turned a peaceful protest march into a violent riot, giving Dredd the excuse he needed to attack the march with riot squads and make mass arrests. Silver used the ensuing massacre as an example of the dangers of democracy and the need for the iron rule of the judges. Armed with this excuse to tighten control, he took every opportunity to do so.<ref>''2000 AD'' #531\u2013533</ref>\n\nDredd's own responsibility for the deaths at the march, and the corrupt way in which the law had been enforced fed his doubts about the integrity of the system to which he had belonged since birth. When in 2112 a young boy was brutally murdered by a man who had been brain-damaged by a judge during the Democratic March, Dredd's reservations came to a head and he tendered his resignation and took the Long Walk himself.<ref>''2000 AD'' #661 and 668</ref> Silver reacted by ordering a news blackout on Dredd's resignation, and covered it up by going so far as to replace Dredd with an imposter, [[#Kraken|Judge Kraken]], a [[cloning|clone]] from the same DNA as Dredd.<ref>''2000 AD'' #668\u2013671</ref> Silver believed that Dredd had become such an important figure of law-enforcement in the public mind that his departure, if it became known, would incite an intolerable increase in crime.\n\nSilver's judgement proved to be fatal, as only weeks later Kraken's loyalty was turned against the city, precipitating a catastrophe which resulted in the whole city falling under enemy occupation with the loss of 60 million lives. (''See main article [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]].'') Silver despaired recovering the situation and fled the command centre in Mega-City One's darkest hour of need. He attempted to commit suicide but botched the job, and was captured alive. He was murdered by Judge Death and then reanimated as a [[zombie]], but with all his mental faculties intact so that he could be tormented endlessly while his city was systematically extinguished of all life.<ref>''2000 AD'' #700\u2013701</ref>\n\nSo ended Silver's life, but not his undeath. When Dredd returned to rescue his city, Silver again fled and hid, fearing that in his [[undead]] state he would be summarily destroyed by the survivors of the disaster. Only when several months had passed did he dare to return to the city. On arriving once more in his Grand Hall of Justice in 2113, he discovered that in his absence his predecessor, McGruder, had reclaimed her office. He challenged her right to be chief judge, pointing out that she had resigned as chief judge whereas he had not. McGruder retorted that Silver was medically dead. However, since McGruder had dissolved the Council of Five there was no recognised authority with the power to decide the issue. The constitutional crisis was finally resolved when both litigants agreed to abide by Judge Dredd's verdict. Dredd actually ruled in Silver's favour, but then convicted him of gross dereliction of duty for deserting his command in time of war. Dredd executed Silver and McGruder became chief judge by default. Silver's incinerated remains were unceremoniously swept away by a cleaner, a truly ignoble end for a head of state.<ref>''2000 AD'' #733\u2013735</ref> Silver's ghost haunts the Grand Hall of Justice.<ref>''2000 AD'' #735</ref>\n\n===Smiley===\n'''Judge Smiley''' was appointed head of a special \"[[black operations]]\" unit by Chief Judge Griffin in 2101, after Judge Cal's reign of terror. His role was to work in the background as \"a judge to judge the judges who judge the judges,\" to protect the city from a future ''coup d'etat'' by another corrupt judge like Cal.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1812\">''2000 AD'' #1812</ref> One of his missions drove [[Dirty Frank (comics)|Judge Frank]] insane; Smiley arranged for him to be transferred to Wally Squad.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1809</ref> He was also responsible for gathering a squad of rogue ex-judges for various operations,<ref>Judge Dredd Megazine #239</ref> including agent Miss Anne Thrope: she was used to manipulate undercover judge [[Jack Point]] into working for Smiley, and tried to explicitly recruit him as an agent.\n\nAfter the \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd)|Judgement Day]]\" conflict in 2114, Smiley disappeared and was presumed dead, [[Judge Bachmann]] duly replacing him as head of his unit. Smiley had actually moved into a secret psi-shielded office hidden in the Grand Hall of Justice, where he remained out of sight for 20 years, covertly monitoring the Justice Department and waiting until he was needed, although he mentions to Hershey that he has influenced many events in the city since his disappearance. Eventually the threat he had been preparing for turned out to be Bachmann herself, who in 2134 plotted to seize control of the city. Smiley recruited a team of judges to investigate her \u2013 a team so secretive that to prevent their discovery Smiley suppressed their memories of his existence and their objectives, using a post-hypnotic command to reawaken them when needed. They succeeded in defeating Bachmann, who was killed by Smiley himself. Both Hershey and Frank were angered by Smiley's tactics: Hershey because Smiley could have brought her on board at any time and deliberately left her out of the loop, and Frank because Smiley had deliberately let hundreds of people die in order to force Bachmann into the open. Hershey openly suggested that they had \"swapped one problem for another\".<ref>''2000 AD'' #1812</ref>\n\nWhen Dredd was abducted in 2136, Smiley told Hershey she didn't need to worry about Dredd's safety; he seemed unconcerned about the impact on Justice Department of Dredd being seen to be defeated.<ref>Megazine #348: \"Rad To The Bone Part 2\"</ref>\n\nThe character Judge Smiley honours the [[John le Carr\u00e9]] character [[George Smiley]], an important supporting character and later central character in many of his post-war espionage stories.\n\n===Solomon===\n\n'''Judge Hollins Solomon''' succeeded [[#Fargo|Judge Fargo]] as Chief Judge of the United States in 2051, and in the following year became Chief Judge of [[Mega-City One]], when Mega-City Two and Texas City acquired their own chief judges for the first time. In 2058 he resigned and was succeeded by his deputy, [[#Goodman|Clarence Goodman]] (with whom he had served as joint deputy chief judge under Fargo). Instead of appointing a new deputy chief judge, Goodman appointed a Council of Five to advise him, and Solomon served on the Council from its inception until after the judges seized power from the president and Congress in 2070. In 2071 Solomon presided over the war crimes trial of [[#President Robert L. Booth|President Bob Booth]], sentencing him to 100 years in suspended animation so that a future generation could decide what to do with him. It is not known what became of Solomon after that, but he does not appear in ''Judge Dredd'' stories except in flashbacks in ''[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]'' and ''[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]''.\n\n===Stark===\n\nA [[Brit-Cit]] exchange cadet, '''Stark''' applied for full transfer to Mega-City One. He first appeared in ''[[The Hunting Party (Judge Dredd story)|The Hunting Party]]'',<ref>''2000 AD'' #1033</ref> undergoing a hotdog run under Dredd and tracking down dune sharks; he showed himself to be a capable Judge and bonded with fellow cadet Renga. He would later be part of Dredd's team during the [[The Doomsday Scenario|Second Robot War]], helping liberate the city: it was his suggestion that they reprogram Narcos' Assassinator droids and use them against him.\n\nWhen sent undercover to combat a block mafia in Shirley Temple Block, Stark was infected with Grubb's Disease by a mob boss \u2013 as was his partner, an old comrade of Stark's who he'd brought in on the operation. Driven mad by the death and the terminal infection, he killed himself to infect the mob boss. His body was returned to Brit-Cit.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1193\u20131196</ref>\n\n===Steel===\n\n'''Judge Amy Steel''' was the sidekick of Dredd in [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]]'s ''Judge Dredd'' audios for Big Finish. An exchange Cadet from [[Brit-Cit]], she was a competent and bright-minded young Judge, assisting Dredd in several cases including against Judge Death; during her rookie assessment, she destroyed the Frendz syndicate's hovership headquarters and took out its current boss. It was eventually revealed that her stepfather was infamous Brit-Cit gangster Harry Karter, who she believed had killed her father when she was a young child; in fact, it turned out she had (accidentally) killed him, and her mother had made a deal with Karter to erase this from her mind. While Karter was brought down, Amy Steel was psychologically damaged and turned in her Judge badge. Amy Steel was played by [[Claire Buckfield]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Vass===\n\n'''Judge Vass''' is (or was) a senior judge and became a member of the Council of Five in 2132.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1693 and 1700</ref>\n\nDuring ''[[Day of Chaos]]'', he clashed with General Poll over the fate of civilian hostages and found Poll's comments about street Judge ineffectiveness \"uncalled for\". Despite this, he voted in favour of air strikes that would doom the hostages.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1750</ref> When the Chaos Virus reached the city anyway, Vass proposed rounding up the first-stage infected, flying them to Cursed Earth burial pits on the pretence of taking them to a medical facility, and then killing them en route. Chief Judge Francisco condemned this as \"monstrous\" and refused to do it, but the proposal was leaked to the public<ref>''2000 AD'' #1777</ref> and caused a citywide uprising. Vass was left horrified by what he had inadvertently caused and resigned, returning to the streets.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1783</ref> It is not known whether he survived.\n\n===Volt===\n\n'''Chief Judge Hadrian Volt''' was chief judge from 2116 to 2121. He first appeared in prog 917 (1994) in a story by John Wagner and [[Carlos Ezquerra]].\n\nVolt became a street judge in 2096 and fought in the First [[The Robot Wars|Robot War]] and the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]]. He later served in the Special Judicial Squad and in the Aliens Bureau. In 2114 he was promoted to chief of Sector 53, where his outstanding administrative ability and judgement reduced violent crime in his sector to the second lowest level in the city.<ref>''2000 AD'' #917</ref>\n\nWhen [[#McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]] resigned her office in 2116, there was no Council of Five to choose a new chief judge in the normal way, since she had dissolved the Council years earlier. Therefore she ordered that her successor be elected by the city's 400 Senior Judges. After careful consideration, Volt decided to stand as a candidate in this unprecedented election, and polled a clear majority of the votes (208), defeating three other candidates, including Judge Dredd himself. (Ironically most people had believed that Dredd would win, but \u2013 as Dredd himself observed \u2013 he had annoyed too many judges over the years. Dredd even voted for Volt himself!)<ref name=\"2000 AD #918\">''2000 AD'' #918</ref>\n\nVolt immediately set about instituting significant constitutional reforms. He reinstated the Council and permanently established the new system of electing chief judges. In 2117 he restored the obsolete office of Mayor of Mega-City One and created a council of elected citizens to give the people more say in how they were governed (although ultimate power continued to reside with the Justice Department).<ref>''2000 AD'' #957</ref> He also established a policy of encouraging the judges to foster better relations with the community.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 3 #9</ref>\n\nHe was also the author of two books: ''Riding the Apocalypse,'' a history of the Apocalypse War,<ref name=\"2000 AD #1167\">''2000 AD'' #1167</ref> and ''Just Justice,'' setting out his ideas for legal and political reforms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nIn many ways Volt proved to be an outstanding chief judge. But when the city was overrun in the [[The Doomsday Scenario|Second Robot War]] of 2121 he blamed himself for having failed to do enough to prevent it. Even when the war was ultimately won, the burden of personal responsibility weighed too heavily on his mind for him to bear. He waited until the bitter end, and then at the moment of victory he shot himself.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' vol. 3 #59</ref>\n\nBut the general public would never be told the truth. [[Judge Hershey|Acting Chief Judge Hershey]] decided that in the aftermath of such a cataclysmic conflict the Judges' interests required a more heroic death for their fallen leader. The Public Deception Unit therefore set about concocting a false story in which Volt had died valiantly in combat, and fabricated the evidence to prove it.<ref name=\"2000 AD #1167\" />\n\nVolt was the perfect Judge to reform the Justice System which under his two predecessors had become badly corrupt and damaged.<ref name=\"2000 AD #918\" /> Ultimately however he simply was not up to the job of wartime leader. This has however been true of many chief judges, with power usually passing to Dredd in times of crisis, as seen for example in the Apocalypse War and Necropolis.\n\nVolt was succeeded by Deputy Chief Judge Hershey, who was elected chief judge in her own right in early 2122.\n\n==Other Judges==\n\n===Bruce===\n\nA judge in the [[Sydney]]-[[Melbourne]] Conurb, '''Judge Lenny Bruce''' was Dredd's liaison and partner when Dredd came to Australia on the trail of both the Judda and [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]] in 2110. Bruce was a highly laid-back officer, stunned a bit by his American counterpart's more brutal methods. He eventually tired of Dredd's obsession with catching Chopper, who had broken no Oz laws, and snapped at him and overrode Dredd's authority, allowing Chopper safe passage.<ref>\"Oz\" part 26, in ''2000 AD'' #570</ref> Later, when StigCorp was targeting Chopper, the skysurfer tried to contact Bruce for aid \u2013 the judge was transferred to Chunder Range before that could happen.\n\nWhen Judgement Day broke out in 2114, Judge Bruce both battled the zombies in Oz and later died as part of the multi-national Judge force sent to end the crisis.<ref>''Dredd Megazine'' vol. 2 #8</ref> Before his death, he showed friendly relations with both Judge-Sergeant Joyce and [[Strontium Dog|Johnny Alpha]]. His first name was revealed during the Judgement Day serial.\n\n===Bulgarin and Kazan===\n'''Supreme Judge Bulgarin''' was ruler of East Meg One until the [[Apocalypse War]]. He delegated the invasion of Mega-City One to his most trusted general, '''War Marshal Kazan'''. However Bulgarin's confidence was misplaced as Kazan assassinated him and took his place. Kazan was executed by Dredd at the end of the war.<ref>''2000 AD'' #245\u2013270</ref>\n\n===Joyce===\n'''Judge-Sergeant Charlie Joyce''' is an Irish Judge. He has a wife and son; Murphyville having a more liberal approach to its Judge Militia than other mega-cities.\n\nHe partnered with Dredd when Dredd was sent to Ireland to extradite a suspect in 2113, with his laidback approach to law enforcement and fondness for drink annoying the Mega-City Judge; for his part, he tried to get Dredd to relax. While skilled in combat, Joyce was left horrified when the Sons of Erin dissidents, under guidance from a Mega-City mob blitzer, launched a brutal terrorist attack: \"I'd have never believed it.\"<ref>\"Emerald Isle\", progs 727\u2013734</ref>\n\nIn the following year, during the [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]] crisis, he defended Murphyville from zombie hordes. He was supposed to accompany Dredd on a suicide mission to kill the necromagus Sabbat, and cheerfully backed Dredd as the best candidate for leading the mission, but he was knocked unconscious and replaced by [[Strontium Dog|Johnny Alpha]]. He saw out the crisis in [[Hondo City]] instead, fighting in the last battle at Hondo's walls.\n\nHe was sent on a hazardous extradition assignment to [[Mega-City One]] soon after. After trying to put up with the more violent city and Dredd and Hershey's unfriendly attitude, he was seriously wounded and finally snapped at Dredd: on his way back home, he told him \"you can stick your Mega-City.\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #808</ref> The 2135-set story \"New Tricks\" implies that Joyce has since died.\nHis son '''Fintan Joyce''' became a Judge as well, starting in 2132. Fintan had grown up wanting to be a Mega-City One Judge and in 2135, he was transferred to the American city (severely lacking in Judges after [[Day of Chaos|Chaos Day]]). Despite his courage, he had trouble adjusting.<ref>Prog 1850: \"Judge Dredd: New Tricks Part One\"</ref>\n\n===Anatoli Kazan===\n\n'''Anatoli Kazan''' is the crippled clone son of '''War Marshal Kazan'''. He was originally a cadet of East Meg Two and was a thorn in Judge Dredd's side, attacking him through his niece [[Vienna Dredd|Vienna]]. He later defected to Mega-City One where he offered to help Defence Division.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1466</ref> Dredd was highly suspicious of Kazan's true motives and persuaded the Chief Judge not to trust him, but the [[Council of Five]] overruled them and voted to employ Kazan (under strict supervision). Kazan's advice and inside information led to Mega-City One's regime change action in [[Ciudad Barranquilla]], in order to prevent a Sov attempt to do the same; Kazan was drawn looking sinister at the end of the story, suggesting a deeper agenda to his actions.<ref>Judge Dredd Megazine 246-9, \"Regime Change\"</ref>\n\nKazan seemed likely to become a significant villain in future stories by writer [[Gordon Rennie]], until Rennie announced his retirement from writing comics in 2008.<ref name=\"sundaymail\">[http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/lifestyle/jobs-in-scotland/2008/05/11/meet-the-big-game-hunters-78057-20413507/ Meet The Big Game Hunters], ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|The Sunday Mail]]'', May 11, 2008</ref> In 2012 writer [[Al Ewing]] brought the character back,<ref>''2000 AD'' #1803</ref> in a story described by the editor as a prelude to coming events. (In this story, Kazan remarked \"and here I thought you'd forgotten me\")\n\nFollowing the events of the Day of Chaos, Dredd advocated killing Kazan: he found it suspicious that \"the one time you ''don't'' have info on the Sovs is when they're about to ''hit'' us\". Kazan denied this, pointing out he'd been cut off from the Sovs for the last seven years and would have outdated intelligence. He also showed he had outside sources and knew that the Council of Five was being reorganised, and felt the new Undercover Operations regime would be keeping him alive.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1803</ref>\n\nKazan was assassinated on the orders of [[#Smiley|Judge Smiley]] in 2140.<ref>''2000 AD'' 2104</ref>\n\n==='Timbo' Parkerston-Trant===\n\n'''Detective Judge Timothy Parkerston-Trant''' was an upper-class Judge on track to making senior rank, who \u2013 after the death of the Star Chamber \u2013 is one of the few such men ''not'' purged from Senior Judge ranks as he's got actual detective skill. His great-uncle \"Fluffy\" was a member of the Council of the Star Chamber. Nobody wanted to work with him due to his overbearingly cheery nature, until Armitage took him as a partner out of desperation; he asks everyone to call him Timbo, but only Armitage and Treasure Steel actually do.\n\n===Treasure Steel===\n\nA Detective-Judge in Brit-Cit, Steel is a long term partner of [[Armitage (comics)|Armitage]] and her first task as a rookie was to apprentice with him. She has much the same views on her job and the city as Armitage, though unlike him she possesses a home life with her wife Terri and their son.\n\nShe was actually created and programmed as a 'sleeper' assassin at a secret facility in the Manchester ruins, with false memory implants. The memory wipe began to break down in 2131, causing her to start thinking she'd grown up in an orphanage in Manchester (something that everyone knew could not be possible) and become more violent, causing her to be committed to a psychiatric ward for a time. According to Armitage, she was terminated from the project and farmed out to Justice Department instead of being sold to the criminal Overlords, but she is not entirely sure he was telling her the truth.<ref>''Megazine'' #285 \u2013 290: \"Armitage: The Mancunian Candidate\"</ref>\n\nAs well as appearing in the ''Armitage'' comic series in the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'', Steel has also appeared in three novels by [[Dave Stone]]: ''[[Deathmasques]]'' (Virgin Books, 1993), ''[[The Medusa Seed]]'' (Virgin, 1994) and ''[[Psykogeddon]]'' (Black Flame, 2006).\n\n==Perpetrators==\n===Don Uggie Apelino===\n\n'''Don Uggie Apelino''' was a [[genetic engineering|genetically altered]] intelligent ape who encountered Dredd several times \u2013 first during a gang war{{Issue|date=November 2009}}, and later after a foiled attempt to have Dredd assassinated{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. After the [[Apocalypse War]], radiation regressed his intelligence to that of a normal ape, whereupon he led a group of insane and brutal apes in the Cursed Earth. Dredd followed a regressed Fast Eeek, and executed the gang \u2013 including Apelino \u2013 as a danger to Mega City residents.<ref>Law of the Jungle \u2013 2000ad Annual 1983</ref>\n\nIn the [[IDW Publishing]] 2013 series ''\"[[Mars Attacks]] Judge Dredd\"'', Apelino features with his intelligence intact as a major character in the plot \u2013 initially the leader of a mafia syndicate in sector 301, then later assisting Dredd and [[Judge Anderson|Anderson]] in the fight against the Martians once his gang has been eliminated.

He suspected her of orchestrating a series of murders, including of a judge and mutant deputies, in Township Three in the [[Cursed Earth]]. Bachmann as good as admitted that she had done this, and arranged for a less mutant-friendly judge to take command of the township. She threatened Dredd and advised him to leave the matter alone.\n\nIn 2134, following the citywide devastation of \"[[Day of Chaos]]\" (2011\u201312), Chief Judge Hershey announced that Bachmann would be joining the [[Council of Five]] as the head of a new Undercover Operations Division, which would also include the [[Special Judicial Squad]] (internal affairs). Dredd was outraged, saying it was like putting \"a cockroach in charge of the exterminators\", but he had no proof that she was corrupt.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1803</ref> SJS chief [[Judge Buell]], who now reported to her, worried that she might become chief judge in a few years and that she was preparing to reorganise Undercover to grab power.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1806</ref> Neither Buell nor Dredd, however, were aware that Hershey had put Bachmann on the Council in order to force her into a public position, where she could not hide. For her part, Hershey was not aware that Bachmann was spying on her, and any other opponent, with a secret psi-judge.\n\nBachmann was the antagonist of ''Trifecta'' (2012). Soon after her promotion, she brainwashed Wally Squad chief Judge Folger into downloading a file with the identities of every undercover Judge and Mega-City spy, arranging for it to be passed onto the corrupt Overdrive Inc. (Folger was accidentally killed in the attempt.) Buell discovered Folger's body and that the file had gone missing, but was unaware of what the file contained or that Bachmann was involved. Afraid she would use that as an excuse for a \"reorganisation\", Buell asked Dredd to find the file so they would not have to inform Bachmann, just as she had expected. The file was sent to Overdrive Inc., while Bachmann ordered Black Ops to kill every name on the list so she could \"restock\" the Squad with her own men.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1804-9</ref> Meanwhile, she was brainwashing large numbers of rich citizens with the \"Church of Simpology\" organisation, both creating a secondary army and indoctrinating the owner of a company that made sleep machines: this would allow her to brainwash judges as well. Her end goal was to seize power, bring Luna-2 down from the moon, and create a theocratic regime where the people would ascend to \"heaven\" (Luna-2) and any troublesome elements would be condemned to \"hell\" (Mega-City One). As far as she was concerned, the Justice Department model no longer worked.<ref name=\"2000AD1811\"/>\n\nHowever Bachmann was not aware that the list had been swapped for another list by an agent working for [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Smiley|Judge Smiley]], her predecessor as head of Black Ops, who was investigating her and Overdrive Inc.. Smiley had secretly recruited Judge Dredd and other judges in order to expose and destroy her. When she realised that her plan had been discovered, she tried to gain power by overt force, ordering her men to kill everyone in the [[Grand Hall of Justice]] and attempting to take the chief judge as a hostage. However her men were defeated by Dredd, Hershey, [[Jack Point]], [[Low Life (comics)|\"Dirty\" Frank]] and [[Galen DeMarco]]. Bachmann was able to physically overpower her opponents and was about to kill Dredd when Smiley himself appeared and killed her.<ref name=\"2000AD1812\"/>\n\n===Bella Bagley===\n'''Bella Bagley''' was an unlucky-in-love woman who fell in love with [[Judge Dredd|Dredd]]. When he rejected her advances she became insane and had to be incarcerated in the psycho-cubes. Escaping twice, on the second occasion she finally decided to kill Dredd in a fit of jealousy and was shot dead.<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=bella Bella Bagley's 2000 AD profile]</ref>\n\n===Mr Bones===\n{{Main|Judge Dredd vs. Aliens}}\n'''Mr Bones''' (original name Dan Riboshevsky) was born in [[Mega-City One]] in 2084. Routine scanning showed he had a [[genetic predisposition]] for [[evil]] and he was expelled from the city to live with other mutants in the Cursed Earth. He returned and entered the [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)#Out of the Undercity|Undercity]] to raise an army,<ref>\"Out of the Undercity,\" ''2000 AD'' #1313\u20131316</ref> but when this was foiled he returned with an even more deadly threat \u2013 the [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorph]]. He came across them when he left the Cursed Earth for a career as a space pirate{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. It is their acid blood which disfigured him and he died when they turned on him.\n\n===President Robert L. Booth===\n'''President Robert Linus Booth''' or '''Bad Bob Booth''' was the last president of the United States.\n\nBooth was governor of Texas City, America's third mega-city, and then in 2060 he was elected vice president, with President Harvisson. He became president during Harvisson's second term, and rigged the 2068 election to become president in his own right, murdering an aide who was about to implicate him. In 2070 he started a nuclear world war, which devastated the planet, and most of America outside its three mega-cities became an irradiated wasteland populated by mutants and bandits, the \"Cursed Earth.\" As a result, the president and Congress were overthrown, democratic government was abolished (except at the municipal level), and each mega-city became an independent city state ruled by its unelected chief judge.\n\nAfter a bloody civil war in which over 100,000 soldiers and street judges lost their lives, Booth was captured and put on trial in 2071. The presiding judge, [[#Solomon|Judge Solomon]], was reluctant to execute the last US president, so he sentenced him to 100 years in suspended animation in the deepest vault in [[Fort Knox]], so that a future generation could decide what to do with him.\n\nIn 2100 Booth's suspended animation was interrupted, and [[Judge Dredd (character)|Judge Dredd]] re-sentenced Booth to hard labour for life on a farm in the Cursed Earth. However Booth raised an army of mutants, the New Mutant Army, intending to overthrow the Judges and become president again. When Dredd was sent to deal with him, he captured Dredd and put him on trial for treason against the United States (although Dredd had been a child in 2070, he had participated in the Judges' assault on the White House). Dredd escaped and used Booth as a human shield, but Booth's men \u2013 underpaid and demoralised \u2013 opened fire anyway, reasoning that if they wanted another president then they could always elect one.\n\n===Borisenko===\n'''Colonel Yevgeny Borisenko''' was the mastermind of a plan to destroy Mega-City One in 2134, in the story ''[[Day of Chaos]]'' (2011\u201312). He succeeded in wiping out seven eighths of the population by infecting them with a deadly biological weapon. He was a soldier of East-Meg One who had survived the [[The Apocalypse War|Apocalypse War]] in 2104, but had been blinded by the flash of the nuclear detonation which destroyed his home city, and had harboured a desire for vengeance ever since. He was captured by Judge Dredd but murdered by one of his sleeper agents during interrogation, after living for long enough to see his plan succeed.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1743\u20131789</ref>\n\n===Call-Me-Kenneth===\n'''Call-Me-Kenneth''' was a robot who appointed himself as leader of all rogue robots during the [[The Robot Wars|First Robot War]]. Kenneth was a carpentry droid driven to rebel by his poor treatment by his owner. Kenneth, equipped with a chainsaw, attacked a number of humans and nearly killed Dredd before being disabled.<ref>''2000 AD'' #9</ref>\nThe Judges then had Kenneth rebuilt, so that scientists could determine what made him break the laws of robotics. Drawn by [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] (the original version was designed by [[Carlos Ezquerra]]), this version is more human like and is equipped with a large drill and a third eye. Accidentally reactivated he instead went on the rampage again and raised a whole army of robots to take over the city. His army was defeated when Walter the Wobot sabotaged the robot factory, producing robots loyal to the Judges, which destroyed the factory. The remaining robots were short-circuited when Dredd used Weather Control to make a lightning storm, and Dredd then hunted down Kenneth himself.<ref>''2000 AD'' #10\u201317</ref>\n\n===Chief Judge Cal===\n'''Judge Cal''' was an insane chief judge of Mega-City One who sentenced the entire population to death in 2101. He was the main villain of the 20-episode story ''The Day the Law Died'' in 1978\u20131979. His name and character were inspired by the mad Roman emperor [[Caligula]].\n\nCal was deputy chief judge and head of the Special Judicial Squad (internal affairs) until he assassinated [[#Goodman|Chief Judge Goodman]] in 2100 or 2101. He automatically became chief judge. His first official acts were to appoint his pet goldfish deputy chief judge, and to sentence Judge Dredd to death for accusing him of murdering Goodman. Most of the other judges had been brainwashed to obey Cal, even while they knew he was mad, using advanced technology, but Dredd, [[#Judge Giant Snr|Giant]] and a few others had escaped this fate. Giant rescued Dredd from execution, and Dredd recruited other judges to their cause, including [[#Griffin|Judge Griffin]], principal of the Academy of Law. Dredd led a citizens' revolution against Cal, but it was defeated by alien mercenaries hires by Cal, called the Kleggs, man-eating lizard-like humanoids who accepted payment in human flesh.\n\nAs punishment for the revolt, Cal sentenced the entire population to death, in alphabetical order, starting with Aaron A. Aardvark. Dredd arranged for Judge Fish to be secretly assassinated, reasoning that the superstitious Cal would think it was a sign of divine disapproval; Cal called off the executions. The Klegg leader, Grampus, was appointed deputy chief judge.\n\nIt wasn't long before Cal again decided to kill the whole city, however, and this time all at once by using a weapon of mass destruction. Dredd's band of resistance fighters was much depleted by this time, and only by sabotaging and reversing Cal's brainwashing technique were they able to defeat Cal in time. Dredd was nominated to replace Cal as chief judge, but he declined, nominating Griffin instead.\n\n===The Creep===\nThe Creep is an apparently [[Immortality|immortal]] mutant living in the [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)|Undercity]] (the remains of old New York City).<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=CREEP The Creep's profile]</ref>\n\nHe is a brilliant but strange maniac able to morph his face and body into every terror imaginable. He takes great delight in torturing those who come from the Mega City down into the Undercity who disturb his playground of horrors. On one occasion The Creep tortured a hunting party that descends to the Undercity. An example of his bizarre behaviour was transplanting the head of one of the members on to the neck of his pet crocodile Yorkie.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nDuring [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]] The Creep left the undercity and met the four [[Dark Judges]]. Judge Fire burned the Creep alive. Judge Fear stared into his face and Judge Mortis touched his flesh, all to no avail. In the end the quartet fled this invincible monster,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and he has not been heard of since.\n\n===Vitus Dance===\n'''Vitus Dance''' was a freelance assassin from the Cursed Earth. He had [[psionics|psionic powers]], including [[pyrokinesis]] (the ability to set fires with his mind), [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], and the power to control the minds of others. The strength of his powers was amplified by [[scorpion]] poison, and he carried two pet scorpions with him to sting him when necessary. In 2117 Dance was hired by mob boss [[#Nero Narcos|Nero Narcos]] to kill an informer in judicial custody, a task which he accomplished by allowing himself to be arrested to get close enough to his victim, and then escaping. He was caught by Judges Dredd and Castillo, and served four years in solitary confinement, during which time he became insane. He escaped by faking his own death and then breaking out of the ambulance taking him to the morgue. Narcos still hoped to use him, but Dance tried to take over his mind. Narcos escaped and betrayed Dance to the Judges, who eventually killed him after many of them were slain.<ref>''2000 AD'' #955\u2013959, 1125\u20131132</ref>\n\n===Dark Judges===\n[[File:JudgeDeathIrving.jpg|thumb|right|Judge Death, the leader of the Dark Judges, shortly after \"judging\" (i.e. killing) an alleged perpetrator.]]\nThe '''Dark Judges''' are four undead judges from another dimension, known as Deadworld. Centuries ago the judges of what was to become Deadworld decided that since all crime is committed by the living, then life itself should be made illegal. They then set about executing everyone in the world, until only four Dark Judges were left: '''Judge Death''', Judge Fire, Judge Fear and Judge Mortis. They were made undead by two witches, Phobia and Nausea, the '''Sisters of Death''', who became undead themselves. Eventually acquiring the technology to travel to other dimensions, they came to Earth and attacked Mega-City One. They have been defeated by Judges Dredd and Anderson several times, but each time only after inflicting great loss of life, most notably in 2112 when they killed 60 million citizens and thousands of judges.\n\nAll four Dark Judges, most prominently Judge Death, speak with a characteristic hiss. For example, their signature phrase is often rendered as \"The crime isss life! The sssentence isss... '''death'''!\"\n\n====Judge Death====\nJudge Death is the founder and leader of the Dark Judges and the arch-enemy of Dredd himself. He is the main antagonist of the series as he is the most recurring villain.\n\nJudge Death was originally Sydney De'ath, the son of a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] travelling dentist who took pleasure on inflicting pain on his patients. Growing up as a corrupt judge, Sydney De'ath would later kill his entire family and later on meet three people who would eventually become the Judges Fear, Mortis and Fire and took them under his wing. He would go on to kill the chief judge of his world and took up the rank as well as meet the Sisters of Death and then become the undead Judge Death and would later battle Dredd many times.\n\nJudge Death's favourite method of killing his victims is to thrust his razor-sharp claws directly into the victim's chest and break the victim's heart.\n\nJudge Death's uniform is a twisted parody of the standard Judge uniform, replacing the helmet's visor with a [[portcullis]], the uniform zipper with crude stitches, and the eagle ornament on the shoulder with a [[pterodactyl]].\n\n====Judge Fear====\nJudge Fear is one of the Dark Judges under Judge Death. As his name states he masters people's fears. Judge Fear wears a [[great helm]] whose visor normally obscures his entire face. He kills his victims by opening his visor and showing his face, which is so horrible that the victim is literally scared to death. Judge Fear's face has only been shown twice in the comics - once as a swirling mass of eyeballs and once as grotesque mandibles. Whether this is his true face or a manifestation of the victim's fears is left unmentioned.\n\n====Judge Mortis====\nOne of the Dark Judges Under Death. Judge Mortis wears no helmet and has a [[sheep]]'s skull for a head. The touch of his hands brings decay, causing the victim to instantly [[decomposition|decompose]], leaving only bare bones. In the prequel Deadworld series he is shown to have been the closest and most trusted to Death of the Dark Judges.\n\n====Judge Fire====\nOne of the Dark Judges under Judge Death's commands. He originally earned the nickname \"Judge Fire\" when still alive and called Judge Fuego, for burning down an entire school for breaking noise regulations during the day. Judge Fire's entire body is permanently engulfed in flames and he wields an equally flaming trident. By throwing his trident he can start lethal fires.\n\n====Sisters of Death====\nTwo undead witch sisters from an unknown dimension who persuaded and turned Judge Death and the other Dark Judges into undead abominations so they would end all life on their world. The claim to have done this on many worlds before and they treat the genocides as a game. The two main ones are Phobia the eldest and Nausea the youngest. There is a third sister who is shown working against them during the genocide of Deadworld but has not appeared in any of the present set Judge Dredd stories. They also have three other cousins, Dementia, Ephemera, and Pustula\n\n===Rico Dredd===\n'''Rico Dredd''' (2066\u20132099) was the \"clone brother\" of Joseph Dredd, which is to say that they were both [[cloning|cloned]] from the same genetic source, in their case [[Chief Judge Fargo]].<ref>\"A Case for Treatment,\" ''2000 AD'' #389</ref> Their growth in the cloning tanks was artificially accelerated, so that within 16 months they emerged with the physical development of children aged five years. They also had their brains electronically induced with knowledge and training which greatly surpassed their apparent physical age, so that they could immediately begin training in law enforcement.<ref>\"Origins,\" ''2000 AD'' #1515</ref> Rico was removed from the cloning tanks twelve minutes before Joe, and so he habitually referred to Joe as his little brother (or \"Little Joe\").<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" ''2000 AD'' #1187</ref>\n\nAt the Academy of Law Rico consistently demonstrated higher levels of skill than Joe, and he graduated at the top of their class in 2079, with Joe coming second.<ref>\"The Return of Rico,\" ''2000 AD'' #30</ref> During his time as a cadet, he requested to join the older cadets in restoring order to the streets of [[Mega-City One]] in the immediate aftermath of the [[Atomic Wars]] of 2070. Rico and Joe served with distinction, and were personally chosen to take part in the raid on the White House to depose [[President Robert L. Booth|President Booth]] (who had usurped his office and had started the War).<ref>\"Origins,\" ''2000 AD'' #1531</ref>\n\nHowever, following an injury during a training mission in the Cursed Earth, Rico began to become more aggressive, underhanded, and determined to prove himself better than Joe. After graduation, Rico began engaging in criminal activities, including extortion, assault and racketeering. Joe suspected that this was the result of exposure to radiation when Rico was injured on a training mission in the Cursed Earth.<ref>\"Blood Cadets,\" ''2000 AD'' #1187\u201388</ref>\n\nWhen Joe witnessed Rico murder an innocent cafe owner who had refused to pay him protection money, Joe arrested him. Rico was sentenced to twenty years [[hard labour]] on the prison colony of [[Titan in fiction|Titan]], where he grew to hate his brother. While on Titan there he illicitly fathered a daughter, Vienna, with a reporter who was interviewing him.<ref>\"Blood & Duty,\" ''2000 AD'' #1300</ref>\n\nAfter serving his time on Titan, Rico returned to [[Mega-City One]] seeking revenge on Joe. Confronting him at his home, Rico challenged him to a duel to settle their differences, knowing that with his superior skills he could always outdraw his brother. However he had grown used to the weaker gravity of Titan after his twenty years there. This slowed him down by a split second and allowed Joe to shoot him dead. Carrying his brother's lifeless body out into the street, Joe declined a paramedic's offer of assistance, allowing the writer, [[Pat Mills]], to conclude the story with a line from [[the Hollies]] song, [[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother|\"He ain't heavy \u2013 he's my brother!\"]]<ref>\"The Return of Rico,\" ''2000 AD'' #30</ref>\n\nAlthough in the original story, Rico was depicted wearing a [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge's]] badge with the name \"Dredd\", some artists in later stories have erroneously drawn him with a badge labelled \"Rico\" as though it were his surname. This is possibly based on confusion with the character [[#Rico|Judge Rico]], whose surname is Rico and whose badge therefore bears that name.\n\nThe 1994 Judge Dredd novel ''[[Dread Dominion]]'' by [[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]] depicts a universe where Dredd executed Rico rather than arrest him and descended into madness. Tte fact that Rico's badge read \"Dredd\" was part of the plot. In a [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universe]], Joe shot Rico instead of arresting him. The bullet went through the second ''D'' in Rico's badge. Joe kept the badge as a souvenir, and eventually had the letter ''A'' substituted and wore it, and changed his name to Dread.\n\n===Judge Edgar===\n\nAlthough in most of her stories '''Judge Jura Edgar''' is not evil or a murderer in the manner of most villains in the ''Judge Dredd'' series (though in her last story it transpires that she is responsible for a number of murders), she is nevertheless one of Dredd's adversaries. She was the head of the Public Surveillance Unit from 2100 to 2122, and then the governor of a [[prison farm]] in the [[Cursed Earth]].\n\nAn ambitious judge, in the 2090s Edgar was part of a small group of judges that committed vigilante murders, under the alias of the Citizens' Court. By working at PSU, Edgar was able to ensure that the others were not caught. After seventeen killings, she had the group disbanded so it could not cause problems for her career advancement.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1589\u20131595</ref>\n\nEdgar became head of PSU when she lost the use of her legs after receiving a back injury when wounded in the line of duty.<ref>Prog 955</ref> She moved around using a hoverchair (anti-gravity wheelchair), and became renowned for her strict discipline and high expectations of her staff. She became PSU's longest serving head, serving twenty-two years.<ref>Prog 955</ref> She occasionally used the wealth of confidential information at her disposal to play power games with other judges to increase her own influence. One notable example of this is when, to avenge herself on Judge Dredd for a perceived slight against her, she orchestrated a disciplinary investigation into [[Galen DeMarco|Judge DeMarco]] \u2013 one of Dredd's associates \u2013 which led to DeMarco's resignation.<ref>Prog 1132</ref> Edgar's reputation for this sort of behaviour led people to compare her to the 20th century FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], and she acquired the nickname \"J. Edgar Hover\" (only ever used behind her back).<ref>Prog 955</ref>\n\nIn 2117 she was discovered to be illicitly keeping sensitive information on other senior judges, which had been compiled by [[#Chief Judge Cal|Judge Cal]] for the purposes of blackmail when he was head of the Special Judicial Squad, the Judges' internal affairs division. [[Judge Volt|Chief Judge Volt]] decided to take no action against her, but when [[Judge Hershey]] succeeded him as chief judge in 2122, Hershey immediately had Edgar arrested and investigated by the SJS.<ref>Prog 1178</ref> On trial before the [[Council of Five]], Edgar defended herself with skill and defiance. She briskly and brusquely discredited what had initially seemed to be overwhelming evidence, reducing the prosecution case to nothing more than empty innuendo, and claiming that the charge was politically motivated.<ref>Prog 1179</ref>\n\nBesides the seniority of the defendant, Edgar's trial is also notable for being the first occasion when [[Judge Dredd]] ever sat on the Council \u2013 having always declined a permanent seat \u2013 when he agreed to sit in a vacant seat to make up the numbers for the duration of the trial.<ref>Prog 1179</ref>\n\nAlthough Edgar was acquitted of all criminal charges, she was still dismissed from office by Chief Judge Hershey. [[Judge Niles]], who was head of SJS and who had personally led the investigation (and brought the whole affair to Hershey's attention in the first place), was transferred from SJS to take over command of the PSU. Edgar was demoted to the lowly position of commanding Cursed Earth Correctional Facility 17, where she remained for eight years.<ref>Prog 1179</ref>\n\nBy 2130 she was in very ill health and on the verge of death from cancer. As part of a final scheme for revenge, she steered Dredd towards the remaining members of the Citizens Court, in the hope that Dredd would be killed by one of them resisting arrest. By the time Dredd had uncovered her involvement she had died, too late for him to arrest her for the murders.<ref>Prog 1595</ref><ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=EDGAR 2000 AD profile]</ref>\n\n===Efil Drago San===\n\nCreated by [[Dave Stone]], Efil Drago San is a notorious and bloodthirsty crime lord. He was born on Puerto Luminae, a lunar colony that refused to buy into the Justice System and faced a heavy trade embargo as a consequence \u2013 as a result, starvation and poverty ensued and Drago San ended up developing a taste for killing.<ref>''Judge Dredd: War Crimes'' audio drama by Stone</ref> He used to operate as a crime lord in [[Brit-Cit]], where he controlled many corrupt high-ranking Judges and developed a nemesis in [[Detective-Judge Armitage]]. Armitage crippled him, forcing him to use a hoverpod to remain mobile; in revenge, Drago San murdered the Judge's wife. Afterwards, they operated under a principle that if Armitage ever harmed Drago San, a large number of innocent people would be killed in response.<ref>''Armitage: Influential Circles'', Megazine 2.13</ref>\n\nIn the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] ''2000 AD'' audio dramas, Drago San fled to Mega-City One and ran afoul of Judge Dredd after setting up the ultraviolent snuff sport The Killing Zone. Following this, he fled off-world but was finally apprehended in the Boranos System by Dredd. Due to the global nature of his crimes, in the book ''[[Psykogeddon]]'' he was put on trial \u2013 but he escaped, killing Brit-Cit's Star Chamber ruling body as he went, and his whereabouts are unknown. He has operations in Brit-Cit still, run by an agent called Ms Frobisher, as shown in Megazine #269.\n\nIn the audio CDs, Drago San is voiced by [[Stephen Greif]].\n\n===Grice===\n'''Judge Grice''' was a street judge who conspired to assassinate Judge Dredd in order to prevent the 2113 referendum about the future of the Justice Department. He was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in the penal colony on Titan, but two years later \u2013 in his own series, ''Purgatory'' \u2013 he escaped. He attacked Mega-City One and killed millions with a weaponised virus before Dredd killed him.\n\n===Hester Hyman===\n{{Main|Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)}}\n'''Hester Hyman''' was an ordinary wife and mother who became so despairing of life under the tyranny of the Judges that she turned to terrorism to raise publicity for the cause of democratic reform. Her death at Dredd's hands spurred many ordinary citizens to campaign for democracy.<ref>''2000 AD'' #460, 531\u2013533</ref>\n\n===Morton Judd===\n'''Judge Morton Judd''' was the genetic scientist who in 2066 created Judge Dredd from the DNA of former chief judge [[#Fargo|Fargo]]. Around that time, he was appointed to the Council of Five (which was then only an advisory body to the chief judge). In 2070 he proposed genetically modifying the citizen population to make them more docile; when Fargo vetoed his plan Judd attempted to assassinate Fargo, but he was arrested and sentenced to death. He was rescued by his accomplices, and fled to an unknown location, which forty years later was discovered to be [[Ayer's Rock]] in Australia, where he had built a base. There he had created an army of clones, called the Judda, with which he attempted to seize control of Mega-City One. His plot was uncovered by Judge Dredd, and Judd and most of the Judda were killed when Dredd destroyed his base with a nuclear bomb. \n\nSome of the Judda who had attacked Mega-City One were taken prisoner; most of them were executed, but one was spared: [[#Kraken|Kraken]].\n\n===Kraken===\n'''Kraken''' was originally one of [[#Judd|Morton Judd's]] clone soldiers, the Judda. He was a clone of [[#Fargo|Judge Fargo]], Judge Dredd's clone father, and therefore identical to Dredd, although decades younger. When Judd was defeated and Kraken was taken captive, instead of executing him [[#Silver|Chief Judge Silver]] decided to groom Kraken to replace Dredd one day, and so Kraken became a cadet at the Academy of Law. At first Kraken only pretended to go along with this, secretly intending to remain loyal to Judd, but in time his allegiance shifted to match appearances.\n\nOn graduating from the Academy in 2112, Kraken's final assessment was supervised by Dredd himself. Despite Kraken's flawless performance, Dredd failed him anyway, saying \"a leopard can't change his spots \u2013 not this one, anyway.\" Although Kraken had no right of appeal and Dredd's word was supposedly final, Silver secretly overruled Dredd and set a final test of loyalty for Kraken. Kraken was sentenced to death for his part in Judd's crimes, and given the opportunity to escape. When instead Kraken administered the lethal injection himself \u2013 actually a harmless anesthetic, unknown to him \u2013 Silver pardoned him and made him a judge. But he was not to be Judge Kraken. As Dredd had resigned and left the city, Silver covered up Dredd's departure and ordered Kraken to impersonate him. For more than a dozen episodes of ''Judge Dredd'' after that, the lead character of the strip was actually Kraken, wearing Dredd's badge.\n\nSilver's plan was disastrous. When the [[#Dark Judges|Sisters of Death]] (beings with tremendous psychic powers) prepared to attack Mega-City One, they targeted Dredd first, but on finding out who he really was, they exploited Kraken's past as an enemy of the city and successfully brainwashed him into becoming their instrument of destruction. Under the Sisters' malign influence, Kraken rescued their brothers, the immortal [[#Dark Judges|Dark Judges]], who took over the city and began slaughtering everyone (including Silver). Kraken became a Dark Judge himself (albeit a mortal one). He was only freed when Dredd returned to the city and banished the Sisters of Death (see [[#Agee|Judge Kit Agee]]); by then 60 million people had been killed. Kraken, once again in control of his faculties, submitted peacefully to execution by Dredd.\n\n{{see also|Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)}}\n\n===PJ Maybe===\n'''Philip Janet Maybe''', usually known as PJ Maybe (or by various aliases), is a serial killer who has frequently been arrested by a Judge Dredd, and has almost as frequently escaped arrest. He committed his first murder at age 12, in a story first published in 1987, and committed more murders as a teenager and then as an adult. He often used mind control drugs to force his victims to kill others or themselves. He changed his appearance several times and took over his victims' identities. Most notably, he killed and stole the identity of '''Byron Ambrose''', and in that guise he was elected Mayor of [[Mega-City One]] (after killing the previous mayor and framing a rival candidate for the murder).\n\nIt was information provided by Maybe which led to the arrest of [[#Sinfield|Chief Judge Sinfield]] for using a mind control drug to depose [[#Francisco|Chief Judge Francisco]]. In exchange for this, Maybe's death sentence was commuted by the re-instated Francisco to life without parole, over Dredd's objections, a decision Francisco later regretted when Maybe escaped and killed again.\n\nMaybe's last appearance to date was a 2016 storyline about him cross-dressing to conceal his identity, ending with him finally being killed by Dredd.\n\n===Nero Narcos===\n'''Nero Narcos''' was the leader of the criminal syndicate called '''the Frendz''', who was a recurring villain in late-1990s [[Judge Dredd]] stories. He was responsible for employing [[#Vitus Dance|Vitus Dance]] and [[Sov Judge Orlok|Orlok]] to assassinate a rival criminal, and instigating the Second Robot War.\n\nIn the story ''[[The Doomsday Scenario]]'', Narcos sabotaged a new batch of upgraded [[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|lawgiver]]s by programming them to self-destruct when used by their authorized users (once they received a radio signal, so the rogue command took effect in all weapons simultaneously). This resulted in large numbers of judges being crippled or killed at the precise moment they were attacked by Narcos's Assassinator robots at the beginning of the Second Robot War in 2121. Nero Narcos was swiftly able to conquer [[Mega-City One]] and drive the Judges underground, but once he had the city conquered he found himself unable to actually run it. After a team led by Judge Dredd, with assistance from [[Brit-Cit]], were able to cripple his robotic army, Narcos was defeated and executed.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Orlok the Assassin===\n\n'''Orlok''' was a judge of East-Meg One, a mega-city in the former Russia. In 2103 Orlok infected Mega-City One's water supply with a substance which caused the population to become insanely violent. This was a precursor to invasion, the first stage of the Apocalypse War. Orlok was captured by Judge Dredd, but he was later rescued and he attacked the city several more times before finally being executed.\n\n===Chief Judge Oswin===\n\n'''Pamela Oswin''' became Texas City's chief judge in 2137. When Brit Cit abandoned Mega City One and demanded Dredd's extradition over the Murphyville Spaceport massacre,<ref>\"Blood of Emeralds,\" ''2000 AD'' #1934\u20131939</ref> Chief Judge Hershey turned to Oswin for help. She quickly arrived and brought a large number of her judges to act a reinforcements for Mega City One's diminished numbers. She quickly had her judges placed in strategic locations throughout the city (missile defence, immigration, Grand Hall security). It shortly became apparent that she did not want to help Hershey but usurp her, and then covertly take full control of the city. Her plan was to rebuild America in her own image, where mutants would be persecuted even more, if not completely wiped out (her rallying cry was even \"The South shall rise again\"). Her plans were foiled when Dredd escaped from Brit Cit and, with the help of some loyal judges, was able to storm the Hall of Justice and kill her.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1973\u20131990 and ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #371\u2013373</ref>\n\nOswin's Council of Five later disowned her, claiming that they had no idea what she had really been doing. Hershey and Dredd did not believe this but there was little they could do about it militarily. However Hershey was able to blackmail and force the Texans into making one of her own judges their new chief judge.<ref>''Megazine'' #374</ref>\n\nOswin's story was told in a story arc composed of five stories and collectively known as \"Every Empire Falls\" in ''2000 AD'' #1973\u20131990 and ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #371\u2013374 (2016), written by Michael Carroll.\n\n===Raptaur===\nThe '''Raptaur''' is the name of a deadly species of alien. They can dismember people in seconds with razor-sharp claws, and their preferred food is human brains. They can create a psi-fog at will and also secrete a toxin which saps the will to live and encourages their prey to submit without resistance; several Raptaurs were \"milked\" for this toxin to create a drug.<ref>Megazine #221\u2013223</ref> Dredd encountered and eventually killed one in 2113.<ref>Megazine #1.11\u20131.17</ref> [[Jack Point]] has owned two as pets (Cliq and Larf), and describes them as both \"harder than a diamond on PCP\" and being more dangerous than the [[Judge Dredd vs. Aliens|xenomorphs]] Mr Bones found.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Sabbat the Necromagus===\n{{Main|Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)}}\n'''Sabbat''' was the villain in the story [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|\"Judgement Day\".]] He started the Fourth World War and tried to kill everyone in the world.<ref>''2000 AD'' #786\u2013799; ''Megazine'' vol. 2 #4\u20139</ref>\n\n===Jacob Sardini===\n'''Jacob Sardini'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=taxde Sardini's profile]</ref> was a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] who stuffed dead human bodies. Among those he stuffed were the [[PJ Maybe|Yess family]].

Francisco appointed Sinfield deputy chief judge, in which capacity Sinfield posted Judge Dredd to an assignment in the Cursed Earth. Sinfield then drugged Francisco with a mind-control drug and ordered him to resign. Sinfield's coup was eventually discovered by Judges [[Judge Dredd (character)|Dredd]], [[#Logan|Logan]] and [[#Buell|Buell]], and he was deposed by the Council of Five and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour in the prison on Titan.\n\nAfter a mass breakout from Titan eventually resulted in the deaths of almost all concerned, Sinfield was the sole survivor. He was captured by East-Meg Two for interrogation, and rescued by Dredd. He remains in the custody of Mega-City One.\n\n===Spikes Harvey Rotten===\n\nThere have been two characters with this name:\n\n*The first was a biker who was killed in Mega-City One while attempting to win an illegal race.<ref>''2000 AD'' #40\u201341</ref><ref>''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'' (by Colin M. Jarman and Peter Acton, Lennard Publishing, 144 pages, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}) pp. 77 and 84</ref> He was not a noteworthy character.\n*The second was created by [[Pat Mills]] as a sidekick for Dredd in the 1978 story ''[[The Cursed Earth]]''. He was also a biker and a criminal. Dredd had him paroled from custody to accompany him on his perilous mission across the Cursed Earth desert, as he was familiar with the territory from his days smuggling guns there. When all of the judges who accompanied Dredd were killed along the way, Spikes still fought by Dredd's side. He was killed only a short distance from Mega-City Two.<ref name=\"2000 AD #61-85\">''2000 AD'' #61\u201385</ref>\n\n===Whitey===\n'''Randolph Whitely''', a.k.a. '''\"Whitey\"''' was the first [[perp]] to appear in the ''Judge Dredd'' strip, in ''2000 AD'' prog 2. He murdered the first judge to appear in the strip, Judge Alvin, prompting Dredd to arrest him and sentence him to life on Devil's Island: a prison with no need for walls as it is located on a traffic island where the traffic never stops and attempting to cross the road means certain death.\n\nWhitey was the first ''Judge Dredd'' villain to return in a sequel, when he escaped in #31. He also returned in the comic's tenth anniversary issue, #520. Dredd (at first having forgotten who Whitey was) killed him in his last appearance.\n\nWhitey had a brother, who tried to rescue him, destroying the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in the process (this story was published in 1977).<ref>''2000 AD'' 1978 Annual</ref>\n\nWhitey also had a son, who tried to avenge his father 40 years after his arrest, but Dredd killed him. This story, \"Forty Years of Hurt,\" appeared in ''2000 AD'''s [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue in 2017.\n\n==Others==\n\n===Blondel Dupre===\n'''Blondel Dupr\u00e9''' was one of the leaders of the movement for restoring democracy in Mega-City One. She led the [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#The Democratic March|Democratic March]] of 2109 and the 2113 [[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#Democracy Referendum|referendum campaign]]. After the first, she was arrested and was only released by Dredd in 2112 due to his crisis of faith over the methods he had used.\n\nWhile Blondel campaigned against the Judges, she had developed some respect for Dredd after he had let her out and instigated a referendum on democracy. She also began to lose faith as a result of her struggle, wondering if she could succeed. When the vote was lost, she was convinced by Dredd that it was not a fix and was forced in public to tell him \"you are the law\" in front of her followers. She retired after losing the vote, no longer believing in the cause.<ref>''2000 AD'' #531\u2013533, 750\u2013756</ref>\n\n===Fargo Clan===\nThe '''Fargo Clan''' are a family of [[Mutants (Judge Dredd)|mutants]] in the Cursed Earth, led by '''Randy Fargo'''. They are distant relatives of Judge Dredd, being descended from Ephram Fargo, the brother of Eustace Fargo, Dredd's clone father. Dredd was unaware of their existence until a chance encounter with them in the Cursed Earth in 2129, when they helped Dredd in an investigation.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1511\u201312</ref> When they tried to visit Dredd in Mega-City One later that year, Dredd was forced to turn them away due to the city's strict anti-mutant laws.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1545</ref> These experiences changed Dredd's hardline anti-mutant views, and led to Dredd securing the repeal of the anti-mutant laws in 2130. Later that year the Fargos were invited back to the city as guests of honour. During a tour of the city '''Jubal Fargo''' was accidentally killed while saving the life of a young child. The family returned to their abode in the Cursed Earth.<ref>''2000 AD'' #1577\u201381</ref>\n\n===Mrs Gunderson===\n'''Mrs Gunderson'''<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=GUNDERS Mrs Gunderson's profile]</ref> is an elderly, deaf and almost blind woman, who mainly appears in cameos to provide comic relief pertaining to her misinterpretations of what she hears people say or her failure to notice what is happening around her.

In a city teeming with citizens dressed in unusual, eccentric or downright bizarre fashions, Max stood out for dressing conservatively in clothes which in the mid-20th century would have been perfectly normal: a pinstripe suit and a bowler hat, an umbrella, and a carnation in his buttonhole. In contrast to his looks, Max spoke in futuristic 'streetwise' slang and had many bizarre habits and affections. In Max's first appearance, Dredd expresses disgust at Max not dressing in \"decent wild clothes\" like everyone else and asks \"why do you young people always have to be different?\"<ref>''2000 AD'' #20</ref>\n\nHe had refined tastes, eschewing water and only ever drinking \"shampagne\" (real champagne being illegal): this saved him from being affected by the [[Block Mania]] contagion which infected the city's water supply in 2104.<ref>\"Block Mania\" part 7, in ''2000 AD'' #242</ref> His one concession to 22nd-century living was his fondness for playing ''shuggy'', an advanced version of [[billiards]] played on an uneven surface of hills and valleys.

He was a child who lived in Bubbletown in the Cursed Earth. He discovered the amnesiac \"Dead Man\" (the lead character) injured and near death in the desert, and helped him discover his identity. During the Necropolis incident, his eyes were burned out by the Sisters of Death; as a thank-you for his assistance, Dredd personally arranged for Yassa to come to Mega-City One to receive bionic eyes, along with counselling from Psi-Judge Anderson to ease the psychic trauma that Phobia and Nausea caused him.\n\n===Satanus===\n'''[[Satanus (comics)|Satanus]]''' was a [[cloning|cloned]] [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] who attacked Dredd in \"[[The Cursed Earth]].\" Although Dredd believed Satanus to have been killed, he actually survived.<ref>''2000 AD'' #76</ref> He has since appeared in non-Dredd stories such as ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]'', introduced in Book V: \"The Vengeance of Thoth.\"\n\n===Marlon Shakespeare===\n{{too long|section|date=March 2020}}\n'''Chopper''' (also known as '''Marlon Shakespeare''') is a fictional character appearing in British comics anthologies ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''.

Marlon wanted more from life than the mundane existence that his parents revelled in so he broke out and found infamy by becoming Chopper \u2013 a wall scrawler ([[graffiti artist]]), challenging authority by making his mark (a smiley face) in increasingly more ambitious and public locations. Soon Chopper became known as King Scrawler of Mega-City One. That was until a Scrawl War broke out between Chopper and a mysterious rival scrawler known as The Phantom, who challenged Chopper's position as King Scrawler by beating Marlon to some of his more ambitious scrawls and openly mocking Chopper in his scrawl (\"Chopper is a Ninco. Signed The Phantom\"). The Scrawl War escalated with more and more inventive scrawls turning up and confusing the [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]], culminating with Chopper defacing the relocated [[white cliffs of Dover]] in 100&nbsp;ft letters. This angered The Phantom who then publicly challenged Chopper to scrawl the [[Statue of Judgement]] on the following Saturday. When Chopper and The Phantom finally came face to face Chopper was shocked to find that The Phantom was in fact a painting droid. Chopper found himself asking the droid what its motivations for becoming a scrawler were and was just as shocked to learn that they were identical to his own \u2013 To escape the monotony of life and to be somebody. The Phantom refused to be taken by the Judges and plunged to its death, leaving Chopper in awe of the similarity of their lives and wondering, as he was being arrested by [[Judge Dredd]], if that was what we all were \u2013 [[robot]]s.\n\nSeveral years later Judge Dredd crossed paths with Chopper again while searching for the masked felon known as The Midnight Surfer \u2013 A [[sky-surfer]] who had evaded the judges with his highly illegal and very dangerous low-flying surfing. While on rehabilitation, Chopper had been given his first opportunity to use a Powerboard and soon realised he had a natural talent for the sport and had become a Powerboard instructor for young kids living in Tommy McArdle Block. Dredd soon discovered that Chopper was actually the Midnight Surfer and had been merely training for the forthcoming Supersurf 7, an illegal Powerboard contest which was to be held on the streets of Mega-City One. Dredd set up 'Spy In The Sky' cameras to track Chopper's movements in the hope that he could find the secret starting location of the contest and thus preventing the race from happening, but Chopper spotted them and outwitted the remote cameras with his skilful and dangerously daring surfing style. When he arrived Chopper found himself surrounded by such surfing legends as Dak Goodvibes, Johnny Cuba and the world champion Yogi Yakamoto, and within an hour was competing against them in a race of suicidal proportions. Tackling set obstacles and avoiding gunfire from the Judges, the surfers sped through the future city, many falling along the way until there were only two men still with a real chance of winning the race \u2013 Yogi Yakamoto and Chopper. The final obstacle \u2013 surfing in the notorious Manfred Fox tunnel against the flow of high-speed traffic \u2013 served as the backdrop of what was later called by many as the single greatest example of surfing ever seen when Yogi Yakamoto fell after being clipped by a large vehicle and was left struggling to his feet as another large vehicle hurtled towards him. Seeing his Idol's imminent demise, Chopper swung his board around and scooped up the injured surfer before once again turning his board against the flow of the traffic and weaved amongst the vehicles, finishing the race with Yakamoto in his arms. The rescue had been in vain though. As Yakamoto lay on the pavement dying he addressed Chopper \u2013 \"You the best boy...Nobody can do what you do. You...King Surfer...\" Again, Chopper was promptly arrested by Dredd, but this time to the entire city chanting his name.\n\nThree years later, the now legalised Supersurf 10 approaches. The previous two Supersurf contests had somewhat ironically been held legally in the Sydney-Melbourne Conurb (The future Australia) with the full backing of the Oz Judges. Hometown boy Jug McKenzie had been champion ever since and, much to the chagrin of Chopper's fans, was fast earning the reputation of the greatest surfer who ever lived. Despite calls from the citizens of Mega-City One for Chopper to be released in time for him to challenge McKenzie on his home turf, Judge Dredd refused to bow to public opinion. The decision was made by Dredd to move Chopper to a maximum-security isolation cube due to concerns that there would be attempts to free the imprisoned champion. During the transfer a mob rushed the Judges and Chopper managed to escape in the commotion. Unsure of where to run to, Chopper called upon his childhood friend Flip Tillis, who, while supplying Chopper with fresh food and clothes, informed the fugitive of the public's desire for Chopper to regain his crown as King Surfer. Figuring Oz was the one place where everybody wanted him to be Chopper set out on his board and began his historic journey over the 'west wall' into the Cursed Earth. His journey was followed by the Mega-City One media as he evaded Cursed Earth mutants and travels to the Mex-Zone, almost losing his life several times on the way. Finally arriving at the Pacific Ocean, Chopper faced the decision to return to imprisonment or to strike out 11,000 kilometres across the Pacific to Oz with the knowledge that he has nowhere near enough power to complete his journey. During a vicious storm in the Pacific his board runs out of power, and as he guides his board to his death Chopper recalls the chanting of Mega-City One following his winning Supersurf 7.\n\nWith no confirmed sightings of Chopper since the news that he was heading into a hurricane, Mega-City One mourns the loss of a legend, and an old friend of Chopper's \u2013 WipeOut Jones \u2013 is sent to represent the city. The news of Chopper's demise is somewhat premature. As his board spirals down towards the stormy sea Chopper spies a lone ship and guides his board towards it. On board Chopper discovers that the only crew member is a paranoid and murderous robot chef called Cookie, who has a penchant for using his crew members as ingredients. Chopper disposes of Cookie after the insane robot tries to put Chopper on the menu. Chopper's board is badly damaged in the scuffle so takes control of the ship and heads to Oz by sea. Having repaired his board, Chopper ditches the ship 40 kilometres from the coast of Oz and completes the journey on his board. He arrives to a hero's welcome, but Dredd attempts to arrest him. The crowds protest but Dredd argues that Chopper cannot race as he missed the qualifying heats. The qualifying Surfers refuse to race unless Chopper is allowed to compete and Dredd is arrested by local Judges as not to cause a riot. The local authorities set Chopper up with a hotel room and donate to him a Bondi Special powerboard to replace his badly damaged Stratos 4 and he sets out to practice for the race with WipeOut Jones. It soon becomes apparent to Chopper that the Bondi Special powerboard doesn't suit his surfing style. On the day of the race WipeOut Jones offers Chopper his Stratos 4 powerboard stating that he (Jones) is merely there to make up the numbers and had no real chance of winning the race. Jug McKenzie taunts Chopper as the pair swap boards, claiming that chopper is clutching at straws.\n\nImmediately before the race Chopper is called to the Surf Marshal's office where he finds Judge Dredd waiting for him. Dredd explains that his arrest was merely a ruse to settle 'other business'. He then informs Chopper \"You can race \u2013 No promises. But when you cross that line I'll be waiting. You've made fools of us too often, Shakespeare. This time, you try to escape... I'll have to kill you.\"\n\nWhat follows is a race of epic proportions. Halfway through disaster strikes when Jug Mckenzie clips Choppers board sending the two favourites crashing out of the race. Seemingly with their chances of winning totally ruined, both Mckenzie and Chopper surf like they never have before and by the time they hit the home stretch they are neck to neck, but McKenzie wins by less than an inch. Chopper is left stunned, in total disbelief that he lost. As Dredd moves in for the arrest, Chopper turns to Jug and congratulates the defending champion, telling him \"You're the tops, Jug \u2013 Number one.\" Dredd raises his gun and calls for Chopper's surrender, but Chopper refuses, and slowly surfs away making no attempt at a quick getaway and giving Dredd plenty of opportunity to fire. But Dredd hesitates and is then struck from behind by Jug McKenzie, allowing Chopper to make a getaway into the Radback (Radioactive Outback \u2013 the Oz equivalent of the Cursed Earth).\n\nA month later and Chopper is living rough in the desert living off [[kangaroo]] meat and still bitter about losing Supersurf 10. On a supply run to the city Chopper attempts to re-run the race course, but realises it's pointless. As he sits on his board eating a 'snagger' that was donated to him by the owner of a market, Chopper is approached by a lone surfer who turns out to be Jug McKenzie. McKenzie cleans Chopper up and gives him new clothes and a friendship is struck up between the former rivals, but all Chopper is interested in is a rematch. This time Chopper wins and he returns to the Radback leaving behind him a new friendship and a new love interest \u2013 Charlene.\n\nNews of Supersurf 11 reached Chopper just before the death of Smokie, a grumpy old aborigine who had taken Chopper under his wing. Before he died Smokie had told Chopper that he should follow his '[[songline]]' and take part in the race. Following Smokie's death Chopper headed towards the City and met up with Jug McKenzie and Charlene and on a flight chartered specifically for the Oz surfers, headed towards Mega-City Two, where the contest was now to be held. Controversy first struck Supersurf 11 when during a parade of the surfers fireworks were set off killing several of the surfers. It was claimed that this was a publicity event by the new sponsors, StigCorp, though the company denied it. The credibility of these denials were weakened when Stig \u2013 the head of StigCorp \u2013 publicly announced intentions for Supersurf 11; The route was to be littered with snipers and missile launchers and napalm. It was to be more of a bloodbath than a race. Up in arms over this outrage, the surfers refused to race on principle until 16-year-old Sonny Williams from Brit-Cit signed up to the race. Not one to shy away from a challenge, and also because the Jug Mckenzie he'd beaten in a rematch was a Mckenzie past his prime, Chopper signed up too. In the days leading up to race day 39 other surfers entered the contest. On the morning of the race a drunk Jug Mckenzie claimed he was going to race in response to his critics calling him a coward and over the hill. Chopper stopped him by locking him in a cupboard. Before the race Chopper was involved in an altercation with Sonny Williams. Chopper could see the kid was scared so infuriated him as to get the young surfers adrenaline pumping and thus giving him a better chance of getting through the first few yards. Within moments of the race starting a shell burst amongst the pack blowing the head of Dallas Hall (who came third in Supersurf 10) clean off her shoulders and embedding a part of her skull in Chopper's left arm, rendering it dead. As the race went on, the bodies dropped frequently until there were only a handful of surfers left, with Chopper in the lead. As Chopper left one of the final obstacles, he was brutally gunned down from hidden machine gun emplacements. Charlene, who had been watching the race on television, left her hotel to be with her fallen lover's body. Chopper regained consciousness and struggled to his feet making his way to one of the gun emplacements where he attacked one of the gunners and using his machine gun killed the other machine gunner. But his efforts were too late as the gunners had already claimed their third victim \u2013 Sonny Williams. The surviving surfers pulled out of the race, but Chopper, knowing that it was too late for him, got back on his board and headed towards the final obstacle \u2013 Stig.  Chopper approached Stig, who, although blind, was to act as a sniper near the finish line. Curious as to why Chopper wasn't making an effort to avoid his gun, Stig doesn't fire and Chopper throws a grenade which he took off one of the machine gunners, killing Stig and his assistant. Chopper turns his board towards the finish line but he soon succumbs to his wounds and collapses on his board, laying lifeless inches from the finish as Charlene runs to where his board hovers.\n\nChopper survived and retired to the Radback, joining Charlene and Jug in a dropout commune. But StigCorp caught up with him and destroyed the commune, killing WipeOut Jones who was visiting Chopper following his victory in Supersurf 12. Chopper and Jug make an almost suicidal assault on the Oz headquarters of StigCorp which leaves Moke Anderson (a survivor of Supersurf 11) dead.\n\nMany fans were upset when the story ''Earth Wind and Fire'' appeared in the first issue of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''. Many felt that Chopper surviving Supersurf 11 undermined the emotional impact of the finale of the ''Song Of The Surfer'' storyline. Especially for such a lacklustre story. [[Garth Ennis]], writer of ''Earth, Wind and Fire'', agreed that bringing Chopper back was a bad idea<ref>[http://viciousimagery.blogspot.com/2007_02_01_archive.html Vicious Imagery: February 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nWhen Jug Mckenzie died, Chopper was brought into touch with Jug's estranged daughter Mercy and her mother, Calista. After Mercy told Chopper about her mother being in trouble Chopper decided to return to Mega-City One for only the second time since he journeyed to Oz. Chopper soon found himself in the centre of a con conducted by Calista and Mercy which brought him face to face once again with his old nemesis, Judge Dredd. As always Chopper ended on top of the situation leaving Calista stewing in her defeat and returned to Oz and his job as a lifeguard.\n\nIn ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #302's \"Twenty Years to Midnight\", set in 2132, Chopper makes a background appearance on a talkshow. The teenagers in this story are unaware of who he is, and view the show as being for adults; the POV character believes Chopper looks tired and lost, looking at footage of \"when he used to matter\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*''The A-Z of Judge Dredd: The Complete Encyclopedia from Aaron Aardvark to Zachary Zziiz'' (by Mike Butcher, [[St. Martin's Press]], March 1999, {{ISBN|0-312-13733-8}})\n*[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/d/dredduni.htm Dredd's World] at the International Superheroes Catalogue\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Judge Dredd}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Judge Dredd Minor Characters, List Of}}\n[[Category:Judge Dredd characters|Minor Characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of comics characters]]\n", "name_user": "Richard75", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHershey", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Judge_Dredd_characters"}

It was later ported to the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] and released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2013 as '''''Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut'''''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-09-24-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut-is-out-today-on-ps3-and-vita|title=Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut is out today on PS3 and Vita|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=24 September 2013|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> The Director's Cut came out on Microsoft Windows and OS X as a free update on 31 October 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superflatgames.com/wordpress/?p=1348|title=100th Post (\u2026and a Halloween treat!)|last=Byrne|first=Jasper|date=21 October 2013|work=Superflat Games|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> In October 2014 the game was also made available for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Wii U]]. The title was released in physical format on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on December 30, 2016 through [[Limited Run Games]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Lone Survivor'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] survival horror game with retro-styled 2D graphics in which the player controls a nameless protagonist following directions provided by the character's apparent hallucinations. When exploring the game world the player will discover items, keys and food. The correct use of each item and key must be determined in order to solve the game's puzzles. Certain food types can be improved by cooking and/or combining them with others. Two-way mirrors found in the game world are used to teleport back to the survivor's apartment. Players possess a flashlight with which to navigate the game world; using the flashlight drains batteries; replacements can be found by scavenging. Mutants must be avoided or killed; a pistol must be found in order to attack mutants, but ammunition is scarce. When the pistol's magazine is empty the survivor automatically loads a new magazine, leaving him open to attack during the process. Mutants are attracted to light and noises, but the player can sneak past by hiding in the shadows. The game features a map for players to navigate with, however, the game does not pause when the game's menus or map are accessed, leaving the survivor vulnerable.<ref name=\"ign\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer\">{{cite web| url =http://www.pcgamer.com/review/lone-survivor-review/| title = Lone Survivor review| author = Wilde, Tyler| publisher = [[PC Gamer]]| date = 2012-04-19| accessdate = 2012-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe survivor's apartment serves as a hub; the player must return with food in order to survive, as well as sleep. Sleeping prevents madness and is also required to save the player's progress. It is possible to combat lack of sleep with pills; these further damage the survivor mentally but the resultant hallucination may result in extra supplies appearing in the survivor's backpack. Progression through the game requires exploration, which fills out the map; sometimes specific items must be located in order to proceed further. Failing to locate these items can result in resources being spent without new areas being opened up, making future attempts more difficult.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"pcgamer\"/>\n\nThe player's interactions with the game's world and inhabitants result in different endings upon completion of the game. These are shown during the game's end credits, emphasizing how the player received that particular ending. A single playthrough of the game can last between three and eight hours.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"pcgamer\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nPlayers control a man in a surgical mask. This character is an isolated survivor of an infection which has turned his city's (and possibly the world's) population into aggressive, shambling mutants. With limited food and an increasingly fragile mental state, the player character must be guided outside his apartment to scavenge and explore. There are no indications that any other survivors exist except for a note which states that there are other survivors on the opposite side of the apartment building, and a man simply called \"The Director\".<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/122/1223463p1.html |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Leif |last=Johnson |date=2012-04-20 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref> Time progresses, in the form of days, as the player saves, by the means of sleeping in the man's apartment (and experiencing strange dreams or hallucinations, by taking either blue or green pills), which appears to be the safest area in the entire game.\n\nThroughout the game references are made to the survivor's state of mind. It is possible to have discussions with a toy cat, or talk the main character's problems out with a real cat that can be adopted; strange characters such as a man with a box on his head are encountered. Rooms may change appearance upon being revisited; making a wrong turn may result in a strange scene. It becomes difficult to interpret what is real to the survivor and what is hallucination.\n\n=== Plot ===\nA nameless man in a surgical mask (referred to in the game as \"You\") has been living in an apartment for an unspecified amount of time after a disease has turned most of the city's inhabitants into mindless [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie-like monsters]]. The man is alone and unsure if there are any other survivors. In the opening scene, which is a dream, he meets a man with a box on his head and a girl in a blue dress. At the end of this dream, a man wearing blue with a single gunshot wound appears before the survivor wakes up.\n\nIn the waking world the man is out of supplies, and is forced to explore for food, weapons, and other survivors. Following leads picked up from his radio, annotated maps, and discarded diary entries, the man explores the apartment complex infested with monsters. He finds a card with a radio frequency, which he uses to discover another survivor, a man who refers to himself as \"The Director,\" who occasionally provides the man with flares, bullets, human and cat food, kitchen supplies, and electronics. Though their encounters are brief, the man and The Director begin to form a friendship. He also encounters multiple times the girl from his dreams, who he claims seems familiar. As he explores, a series of bizarre, seemingly paranormal events occur and it seems the man is struggling with his sanity. After many days spent possibly dreaming of the man in blue or the man who wears a box, and many nights spent in confrontation with a large and aggressive monster, the man is able to leave the apartment safely, and begin to explore the city.\n\nThe Director tells him that he is going to leave the city. Determined to get past a crashed bus, the man gathers supplies so he may open the bus door. Not sure what to expect, the man is attacked by a large, screaming monster with scythe-like arms known as Mother. After a brief confrontation, the monster flees and the man finds The Director mortally wounded. In their final conversation, The Director tells him that he should go to the hospital, and gives him the hospital's security code. Upon arriving at the hospital, he finds a clipboard with his name on it, even though he claims he has never been a patient there. He proceeds to the room indicated on the clipboard where the door shuts and he becomes trapped. Seeing nothing else to do, he takes a blue, red or green pill (depending on how the player progressed through the game) at the bedside and then goes to sleep. The scenes leading to the final one are different depending on the choices that the player has made throughout the game. However, the final scene always contains a shot of the man and the girl in the blue dress having a conversation and looking out upon the city. In the Director's Cut, assuming the player has the maximum mental health score, and does a multitude of other things throughout the game, they will get a different ending, where the character walks down a hallway in the hospital while hiding from the girl in the blue dress, who appears to be infected and is crawling across the ground. It will still end with the man and the girl looking out to the city. A joke ending also exists, where the man dances at a party (which was likely a hallucination).\n\n=== Endings ===\n\n;Blue Ending\nIn the 'blue' ending the player encounters the man who had gunshot wounds in the game's opening. The man in blue taunts and laughs at the protagonist, leading the man to shoot at him. After shooting, the man's appearance changes to resemble the man in blue, whose gunshot wound is fully healed. The game concludes with a clear view of the devastated city, followed by a conversation between him and 'her' sitting on a hill. This ending suggests the man's possible descent into further madness, or the indifference of the main character to his problems and sanity.\n\n;Red Ending\nThe 'red' ending is an alternate outcome to the previous ending and is triggered if the player's mental score is at the absolute lowest possible. After shooting, the man's appearance changes to resemble the man in blue, after the manifestation of the similar gunshot wound on the protagonist. The game concludes with a clear view of the devastated city, just like in the 'blue' ending, followed by a conversation between him and 'her' sitting on a hill. This ending suggests the man's further psychological madness, demise during a coma or possible suicide.\n\n;Green Ending\nIn the 'green' ending, it is suggested through cryptic and brief flashbacks of conversations that the woman in blue was a sister, spouse, or girlfriend to the man and that it was her who possibly died in some form of accident or illness (although it is implied that it could be the result of a car bomb, judging by the deprived environment in the city and several references to war within the game). It is at least hinted that in living through survivor's guilt, the man goes through a psychotic episode and is admitted into a psychiatric ward in which he experiences the game up until that point as an insane musing - combating both the violent nature of himself (the man in blue) and his imaginings which serve to pull him away from the truth. \n\n;White Ending\nAvailable only in the Director's Cut, the 'white' ending is an extension of the green ending and is possible only on or after a [[New Game Plus|second playthrough]]. By accomplishing various obscure goals throughout the game and attaining the highest possible mental score, the player can unlock a different door in the hospital, leading down to the basement. There, the nameless man must avoid legless versions of the girl in the blue dress, as they chase him through a hallway that becomes increasingly organic. Finally reaching the end, he ends up in a hospital room, with a glass of water to be taken. Upon drinking the water and going to sleep on the bed, the nameless man has a heartfelt conversation with a healthy version of the woman in blue, followed by scenes largely similar to those seen in the 'green' ending, implying that the man had finally overcome his survivor's guilt and can move on at last.\n\n;Yellow Ending\nAvailable only in the Director's Cut, the 'yellow' ending is also only available on a repeat playthrough. By completing a series of specific tasks and also attaining the white ending on the previous playthrough, giving a particular item to the first NPC the player meets will unlock a \"joke\" ending where the nameless man decides to simply dance his troubles away at the NPCs party instead of completing the game's tasks again.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date = December 2014}}{{Video game reviews\n<!-- Aggregators -->\n| GR = (PS3) 82.50%<ref name=\"GR-PS3\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps3/707754-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (PS3) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(Vita) 81.36%<ref name=\"GR-Vita\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/vita/707752-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (Vita) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(PC) 80.62%<ref name=\"GR\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/665784-lone-survivor/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (PC) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><br />(PS4) 80.00%<ref name=\"GR-PS4\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps4/860181-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (PS4) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(WIIU) 76.25%<ref name=\"GR-WIIU\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii-u/824072-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (WIIU) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2017-05-26}}</ref>\n| MC = (PS3) 84/100<ref name=\"MC-ps3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/lone-survivor-the-directors-cut |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for PS3 at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(PC) 81/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/lone-survivor |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for PC at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(Vita) 81/100<ref name=\"MC-Vita\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/lone-survivor-the-directors-cut |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for Playstation Vita at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(WIIU) 76/100<ref name=\"MC-WIIU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii-u/lone-survivor-the-directors-cut |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for Wii U at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref>\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n| Edge = 7/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/lone-survivor-review |title=Lone Survivor review |author=Edge Staff |date=2012-04-24 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Online]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 8/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-25-lone-survivor-review |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Lewis |last=Denby |date=2012-04-25 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lone-survivor-review/1900-6374889/ |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Eric |last=Neigher |date=2012-05-03 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/lone-survivor/1222499p1.html |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Nathan |last=Grayson |date=2012-04-06 |work=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.5/10<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n| PCGUS = 79/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/lone-survivor-review/ |title=Lone Survivor review |first=Tyler |last=Wilde |date=2012-04-19 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Lone Survivor'' received positive reviews from critics, with most reviewers praising the game for its storyline and gameplay, but some reviewers criticized the game for not delivering on the psychological horror aspect{{Citation needed|date = December 2014}}.

The title was released in physical format on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on December 30, 2016 through [[Limited Run Games]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Lone Survivor'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] survival horror game with retro-styled 2D graphics in which the player controls a nameless protagonist following directions provided by the character's apparent hallucinations. When exploring the game world the player will discover items, keys and food. The correct use of each item and key must be determined in order to solve the game's puzzles. Certain food types can be improved by cooking and/or combining them with others. Two-way mirrors found in the game world are used to teleport back to the survivor's apartment. Players possess a flashlight with which to navigate the game world; using the flashlight drains batteries; replacements can be found by scavenging. Mutants must be avoided or killed; a pistol must be found in order to attack mutants, but ammunition is scarce. When the pistol's magazine is empty the survivor automatically loads a new magazine, leaving him open to attack during the process. Mutants are attracted to light and noises, but the player can sneak past by hiding in the shadows. The game features a map for players to navigate with, however, the game does not pause when the game's menus or map are accessed, leaving the survivor vulnerable.<ref name=\"ign\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer\">{{cite web| url =http://www.pcgamer.com/review/lone-survivor-review/| title = Lone Survivor review| author = Wilde, Tyler| publisher = [[PC Gamer]]| date = 2012-04-19| accessdate = 2012-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe survivor's apartment serves as a hub; the player must return with food in order to survive, as well as sleep. Sleeping prevents madness and is also required to save the player's progress. It is possible to combat lack of sleep with pills; these further damage the survivor mentally but the resultant hallucination may result in extra supplies appearing in the survivor's backpack. Progression through the game requires exploration, which fills out the map; sometimes specific items must be located in order to proceed further. Failing to locate these items can result in resources being spent without new areas being opened up, making future attempts more difficult.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"pcgamer\"/>\n\nThe player's interactions with the game's world and inhabitants result in different endings upon completion of the game. These are shown during the game's end credits, emphasizing how the player received that particular ending. A single playthrough of the game can last between three and eight hours.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"pcgamer\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nPlayers control a man in a surgical mask. This character is an isolated survivor of an infection which has turned his city's (and possibly the world's) population into aggressive, shambling mutants. With limited food and an increasingly fragile mental state, the player character must be guided outside his apartment to scavenge and explore. There are no indications that any other survivors exist except for a note which states that there are other survivors on the opposite side of the apartment building, and a man simply called \"The Director\".<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/122/1223463p1.html |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Leif |last=Johnson |date=2012-04-20 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref> Time progresses, in the form of days, as the player saves, by the means of sleeping in the man's apartment (and experiencing strange dreams or hallucinations, by taking either blue or green pills), which appears to be the safest area in the entire game.\n\nThroughout the game references are made to the survivor's state of mind. It is possible to have discussions with a toy cat, or talk the main character's problems out with a real cat that can be adopted; strange characters such as a man with a box on his head are encountered. Rooms may change appearance upon being revisited; making a wrong turn may result in a strange scene. It becomes difficult to interpret what is real to the survivor and what is hallucination.\n\n=== Plot ===\nA nameless man in a surgical mask (referred to in the game as \"You\") has been living in an apartment for an unspecified amount of time after a disease has turned most of the city's inhabitants into mindless [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie-like monsters]]. The man is alone and unsure if there are any other survivors. In the opening scene, which is a dream, he meets a man with a box on his head and a girl in a blue dress. At the end of this dream, a man wearing blue with a single gunshot wound appears before the survivor wakes up.\n\nIn the waking world the man is out of supplies, and is forced to explore for food, weapons, and other survivors. Following leads picked up from his radio, annotated maps, and discarded diary entries, the man explores the apartment complex infested with monsters. He finds a card with a radio frequency, which he uses to discover another survivor, a man who refers to himself as \"The Director,\" who occasionally provides the man with flares, bullets, human and cat food, kitchen supplies, and electronics. Though their encounters are brief, the man and The Director begin to form a friendship. He also encounters multiple times the girl from his dreams, who he claims seems familiar. As he explores, a series of bizarre, seemingly paranormal events occur and it seems the man is struggling with his sanity. After many days spent possibly dreaming of the man in blue or the man who wears a box, and many nights spent in confrontation with a large and aggressive monster, the man is able to leave the apartment safely, and begin to explore the city.\n\nThe Director tells him that he is going to leave the city. Determined to get past a crashed bus, the man gathers supplies so he may open the bus door. Not sure what to expect, the man is attacked by a large, screaming monster with scythe-like arms known as Mother. After a brief confrontation, the monster flees and the man finds The Director mortally wounded. In their final conversation, The Director tells him that he should go to the hospital, and gives him the hospital's security code. Upon arriving at the hospital, he finds a clipboard with his name on it, even though he claims he has never been a patient there. He proceeds to the room indicated on the clipboard where the door shuts and he becomes trapped. Seeing nothing else to do, he takes a blue, red or green pill (depending on how the player progressed though the game) at the bedside and then goes to sleep. The scenes leading to the final one are different depending on the choices that the player has made throughout the game. However, the final scene always contains a shot of the man and the girl in the blue dress having a conversation and looking out upon the city. In the Director's Cut, assuming the player has the maximum mental health score, and does a multitude of other things throughout the game, they will get a different ending, where the character walks down a hallway in the hospital while hiding from the girl in the blue dress, who appears to be infected and is crawling across the ground. It will still end with the man and the girl looking out to the city. A joke ending also exists, where the man dances at a party (which was likely a hallucination).\n\n=== Endings ===\n\n;Blue Ending\nIn the 'blue' ending the player encounters the man who had gunshot wounds in the game's opening. The man in blue taunts and laughs at the protagonist, leading the man to shoot at him. After shooting, the man's appearance changes to resemble the man in blue, whose gunshot wound is fully healed. The game concludes with a clear view of the devastated city, followed by a conversation between him and 'her' sitting on a hill. This ending suggests the man's possible descent into further madness, or the indifference of the main character to his problems and sanity.\n\n;Red Ending\nThe 'red' ending is an alternate outcome to the previous ending and is triggered if the player's mental score is at the absolute lowest possible. After shooting, the man's appearance changes to resemble the man in blue, after the manifestation of the similar gunshot wound on the protagonist. The game concludes with a clear view of the devastated city, just like in the 'blue' ending, followed by a conversation between him and 'her' sitting on a hill. This ending suggests the man's further psychological madness, demise during a coma or possible suicide.\n\n;Green Ending\nIn the 'green' ending, it is suggested through cryptic and brief flashbacks of conversations that the woman in blue was a sister, spouse, or girlfriend to the man and that it was her who possibly died in some form of accident or illness (although it is implied that it could be the result of a car bomb, judging by the deprived environment in the city and several references to war within the game). It is at least hinted that in living through survivor's guilt, the man goes though a psychotic episode and is admitted into a psychiatric ward in which he experiences the game up until that point as an insane musing - combating both the violent nature of himself (the man in blue) and his imaginings which serve to pull him away from the truth. \n\n;White Ending\nAvailable only in the Director's Cut, the 'white' ending is an extension of the green ending and is possible only on or after a [[New Game Plus|second playthrough]]. By accomplishing various obscure goals throughout the game and attaining the highest possible mental score, the player can unlock a different door in the hospital, leading down to the basement. There, the nameless man must avoid legless versions of the girl in the blue dress, as they chase him through a hallway that becomes increasingly organic. Finally reaching the end, he ends up in a hospital room, with a glass of water to be taken. Upon drinking the water and going to sleep on the bed, the nameless man has a heartfelt conversation with a healthy version of the woman in blue, followed by scenes largely similar to those seen in the 'green' ending, implying that the man had finally overcome his survivor's guilt and can move on at last.\n\n;Yellow Ending\nAvailable only in the Director's Cut, the 'yellow' ending is also only available on a repeat playthrough. By completing a series of specific tasks and also attaining the white ending on the previous playthrough, giving a particular item to the first NPC the player meets will unlock a \"joke\" ending where the nameless man decides to simply dance his troubles away at the NPCs party instead of completing the game's tasks again.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date = December 2014}}{{Video game reviews\n<!-- Aggregators -->\n| GR = (PS3) 82.50%<ref name=\"GR-PS3\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps3/707754-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (PS3) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(Vita) 81.36%<ref name=\"GR-Vita\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/vita/707752-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (Vita) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(PC) 80.62%<ref name=\"GR\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/665784-lone-survivor/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (PC) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><br />(PS4) 80.00%<ref name=\"GR-PS4\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps4/860181-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (PS4) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(WIIU) 76.25%<ref name=\"GR-WIIU\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii-u/824072-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut/index.html |title=Lone Survivor (WIIU) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2017-05-26}}</ref>\n| MC = (PS3) 84/100<ref name=\"MC-ps3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/lone-survivor-the-directors-cut |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for PS3 at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(PC) 81/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/lone-survivor |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for PC at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(Vita) 81/100<ref name=\"MC-Vita\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/lone-survivor-the-directors-cut |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for Playstation Vita at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref><br />(WIIU) 76/100<ref name=\"MC-WIIU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii-u/lone-survivor-the-directors-cut |title=Lone Survivor Reviews for Wii U at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-12-30}}</ref>\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n| Edge = 7/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/lone-survivor-review |title=Lone Survivor review |author=Edge Staff |date=2012-04-24 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Online]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 8/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-25-lone-survivor-review |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Lewis |last=Denby |date=2012-04-25 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lone-survivor-review/1900-6374889/ |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Eric |last=Neigher |date=2012-05-03 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/lone-survivor/1222499p1.html |title=Lone Survivor Review |first=Nathan |last=Grayson |date=2012-04-06 |work=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.5/10<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n| PCGUS = 79/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/lone-survivor-review/ |title=Lone Survivor review |first=Tyler |last=Wilde |date=2012-04-19 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Lone Survivor'' received positive reviews from critics, with most reviewers praising the game for its storyline and gameplay, but some reviewers criticized the game for not delivering on the psychological horror aspect{{Citation needed|date = December 2014}}.

Court was held in a local store and prisoners were held in the homes of respected citizens until a proper courthouse could be built. A former boardinghouse was purchased for the purpose, but was deemed unfit for county business during the renovation process, so a new wood frame building was built on a donated lot in the middle of the town square. This building burned to the ground in the 1890s and was replaced with a stone courthouse. It was suspected that an arsonist set fire to the building due to the location of the start of the fire and the timing. In just a few days, the fireproof safe would have been completed and all county records, including indictments, would have been protected from fire.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Burning of Baxter County Courthouse, Feb 23rd, 1890 |journal=The Baxter County History |date=1976 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=14 |url=http://www.baxtercountyhistory.org/Images/Quarterly%20PDFs/BCHv2n1.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>  In 1912, a local town, [[Cotter, Arkansas|Cotter]], was booming while growth in Mountain Home had slowed, and there was talk of moving the County Seat to the riverfront town.

The Mountain Home Male and Female Academy was opened in 1853 and provided much needed education in the absence of accessible public schools.\n\nThe town was nearly destroyed by [[Bushwackers]] during the [[civil war]].\n\n===The Courthouse===\nWhen Baxter County was incorporated on March 24, 1873, Mountain Home was named as the county seat. Court was held in a local store and prisoners were held in the homes of respected citizens until a proper courthouse could be built. A former boardinghouse was purchased for the purpose, but was deemed unfit for county business during the renovation process, so a new wood frame building was built on a donated lot in the middle of the town square. This building burned to the ground in the 1890s and was replaced with a stone courthouse. It was suspected that an arsonist set fire to the building due to the location of the start of the fire and the timing. In just a few days, the fireproof safe would have been completed and all county records, including indictments, would have been protected from fire.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Burning of Baxter County Courthouse, Feb 23rd, 1890 |journal=The Baxter County History |date=1976 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=14 |url=http://www.baxtercountyhistory.org/Images/Quarterly%20PDFs/BCHv2n1.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>  In 1912, a local town, [[Cotter, Arkansas|Cotter]], was booming while growth in Mountain Home had slowed, and there was talk of moving the County Seat to the riverfront town. Mountain Home added a third floor to their existing court house due to an Arkansas law that prevented county seats from being moved away from a three story building. The current court house was completed in 1943 and is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web |title=Baxter County History |url=http://www.baxtercounty.org/history.php |website=Baxter County Government |publisher=Baxter County Government |accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n.\n\n.\n\n==Transportation==\nHighways in Mountain Home:\n*[[File:US 62 (1961).svg|20px]][[File:US 412.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 62 in Arkansas|US 62]]/[[U.S. Route 412 in Arkansas|US 412]]\n*[[File:US 62B.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Mountain Home, Arkansas)|U.S. Route 62 Business]]\n*[[File:Arkansas 5.svg|20px]] [[Highway 5 (Arkansas)|Highway 5]]\n*[[File:Arkansas 101.svg|25px]] [[Arkansas Highway 101|Highway 101]]\n*[[File:Arkansas 178.svg|25px]] [[Arkansas Highway 178|Highway 178]]\n*[[File:Arkansas 201.svg|25px]] [[Arkansas Highway 201|Highway 201]]\n*[[File:Arkansas 201S.svg|25px]] [[Arkansas Highway 201S|Highway 201 Spur]]\n\nThe city is served by [[Ozark Regional Airport]], a county-owned, public-use airport with a few commercial flights.\n \nNo railroads pass through Mountain Home, but the [[Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad]] passes through the nearby community of Cotter, {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the west.
