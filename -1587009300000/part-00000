Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

[[Estrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother does not leave her young for long, and starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become [[sexually mature]] at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and thorn scrubs.

Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Home range]]s tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges {{convert|1.4|\u2013|18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size for females, while those of males measured {{convert|8.5|\u2013|25.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area.<ref name=Hunter/> Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of {{convert|88|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi}}, while the home range of a female in the same region measured {{convert|13|\u2013|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.<ref name=Nowak/> Population densities are typically low, around {{convert|0.01|to|0.05|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}, though the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as {{convert|0.2|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bellani/>\n\nMarking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered. Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

[[Estrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother does not leave her young for long, and starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become [[sexually mature]] at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and thorn scrubs. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] margay, ocelot and oncilla, the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas.

It was released on 4 May 2015 through [[Gentlemen of the Road (record label)|Gentlemen of the Road]], [[Island Records|Island]], [[Glassnote Records|Glassnote]] and [[Universal Music Group]]. It was an international success in its first week on sale, charting at number one in seven countries, topping both the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and reaching the top 5 in nine other countries.

It was released on 4 May 2015 through [[Gentlemen of the Road (record label)|Gentlemen of the Road]], [[Island Records|Island]], [[Glassnote Records|Glassnote]] and [[Universal Music Group]]. It was an international success in its first week on sale, charting at number one in seven countries, topping both the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and reaching the top 5 in nine other countries. Five singles have been released from the album, \"[[Believe (Mumford & Sons song)|Believe]]\", \"[[The Wolf (Mumford & Sons song)|The Wolf]]\", \"[[Ditmas (song)|Ditmas]]\", \"[[Tompkins Square Park (song)|Tompkins Square Park]]\" and \"[[Just Smoke]]\".\n\nAfter working with [[Markus Dravs]] for their first two albums, the band decided to hire producer [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]] and [[The National (band)|The National]]'s [[Aaron Dessner]]. The album marks a departure from the group's [[folk rock]] sound, as they abandoned their signature acoustic instruments (such as [[banjo]] and [[upright bass]]) for electric ones and added a session drummer to fill out their rhythm section.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn September 2013, following the end of the world tour in support of their second album ''Babel'', Mumford & Sons began what they thought would be a lengthy break, but found themselves back at work only five months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/mumford-sons-talk-going-electric-on-new-album-wilder-mind-20150302|title=Mumford & Sons Talk Going Electric on New Album \u2018Wilder Mind\u2019|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> After a couple of days in London at Dwane's studio, the band headed back to Brooklyn to write and demo tracks at the garage studio owned by [[The National (band)|The National]]\u2019s [[Aaron Dessner]], where the band had spent time recording demos In the months leading up to the end of the ''Babel'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mumfordandsons.com/band/|title=The Band \u2013 Mumford & Sons|work=Mumford & Sons}}</ref> Lovett and Marshall were living in New York, with Mumford & Dwane still based in England, so for the next eight months, the band split their writing sessions between Dessner's New York garage and London's Eastcote Studios, where their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'' had been recorded.
