Some warriors of the Oneida and Tuscarora also allied with them, as warfare was highly decentralized. These nations had longstanding trade relations with the British and hoped they might stop European-American encroachment on their territories. These allies were from the Six Nations of the ''[[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]]'' or Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nAfter the colonists' victory, the British government ceded all of its territory in the colonies to their new government under a peace treaty, including that belonging to the Six Nations: without consulting them or making them party to treaty negotiations. The Crown worked to resettle native [[Loyalists]] in Canada and provide some compensation for lands lost in the new United States. The Crown also hoped to use these new settlers, both Native Americans and European Americans, to develop agriculture and towns in areas west of [[Quebec]], the territory later known as [[Upper Canada]].\n\nThe new lands granted to Six Nations reserves were all near important Canadian military targets and placed along the border to prevent any American invasion.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}<!-- whose interpretation is this? The reserves were also near existing waterways, the only means of transportation and the obvious place for settlements because of water supply --> The growth of the Six Nations community was also hampered. Land, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, granted a certain measure of power to their owners. Influential leaders such as [[Joseph Brant]] and Deseronto were prevented from granting land to business owners who could have brought industry and agriculture to their lands. Rules and laws were created to prevent the growth of political support for these men by banning all non natives from living and owning any business on reserves {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Many complained that much of lands granted were clay and rock ridden, making the land untenable {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}.\n\nAfter the war, Mohawk leaders [[John Deseronto]] and [[Joseph Brant]] met with the British officer [[Frederick Haldimand]] to discuss the loss of their lands in New York. Haldimand promised to resettle the Mohawk near the [[Bay of Quinte]], on the northeast shore of [[Lake Ontario]], in present-day [[Ontario]], Canada. Haldimand purchased from other First Nations a tract 12 by {{convert|13|mi|km}} on the Bay of Quinte, which he granted to the Mohawk. (There are of course questions about First Nations understanding of such purchase). About 200 Mohawk settled with Deseronto at what is now called the [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario]]. The group of Mohawk originally led by [[John Deseronto]], who died in the [[Deseronto|town]] named after him, settled on the Bay of Quinte known as ''Tyendinaga''. These were primarily Mohawk of the Lower Castle (of New York).\n\n===Six Nations at Grand River===\nBrant decided that he preferred to settle on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] north of Lake Erie. Mohawk of the Upper Castle joined him in settling on the Grand River, as did bands of the other Six Nations. By the [[Haldimand Proclamation]] of October 25, 1784, the government granted a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] of land to the [[Mohawk Nation]] and [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] bands in appreciation of their support for [[The Crown]] during the revolution. [[Joseph Brant]] led a large group of Iroquois to settle in what is now referred to as \"Six Nations of the Grand River.\"\n\nA 1785 census recorded 1,843 Natives living on the Grand River reserve, including 548 [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], 281 [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]], 145 [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], 262 [[Oneida nation|Oneida]], 109 [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]], and 98 [[Seneca nation|Seneca]]. There were also 400 persons from other tribes, including [[Delaware]] (Lenape), and others from southern territory, such as the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]], [[Tutelo]], and some [[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Cherokee]].<ref>Kelsay pg. 370</ref> African-American slaves were also brought to Six Nations and Brantford by Joseph Brant.

To encourage his loyalist friends to settle there, Brant gave them larger grants than the government had given other loyalists in other areas of Upper Canada. Some Canadians objected to Brant giving such land grants to whites in the reserve area. This was the beginning of attempts to curtail any growth Brant might secure for his people.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} \n\nAs the government did for European Americans, the Indian department provided the Aboriginals with some tools and other provisions for resettlement, including such items as saws, axes, [[grindstones]], and chisels. They received help in establishing schools and churches, and in acquiring farm equipment and other necessities. Conditions were extremely difficult in the first years on the frontier, as the government did not provide enough supplies or assistance to any of the resettled loyalists, neither Native Americans nor European Americans. They had to create new settlements out of woodlands. In 1785, the government built the first [[Protestant]] church in [[Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]) on the reserve; it was known as [[Mohawk Chapel|Her Majesty's Royal Chapel of the Mohawks]]. The Crown maintained its support of this chapel, and it is among only twelve [[Chapel Royal|Chapels Royal]] in the world.\n\nThe main town developed at what is now [[Brantford]]. It was first called Brant's Town after [[Joseph Brant]], who built his residence there. In 1798, it was described as a large and sprawling settlement. Brant's home was a handsome two-story house, built in a European-American style. In 1797, Brant founded one of the earliest [[Masonic Lodge]]s in Upper Canada; he achieved the rank of its [[Masonic Lodge Officers#Worshipful Master|Worshipful Master]].\n\nGovernor [[John Simcoe]] confirmed the Grant with a limited deed on January 14, 1793.  This deed did not extend to the source of the Grand River{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, territory to which the Six Nations have maintained they were entitled as described in the earlier [[Haldimand Proclamation]].  Also, this deed forbade them to sell the land to anyone but each other and the king. Led by Joseph Brant, the chiefs rejected the deed. In 1795, the Grand River chiefs empowered Joseph Brant to sell large blocks of land in the northern section, which the Aboriginals were not using at the time. They set terms of no money down because they wanted to take their payment entirely in future years as annual interest. At this time, the population on the reserve was declining; some Aboriginals left the Grand River for traditional native communities in New York. After Brant's land sales started in 1795, the population began to increase again. He and the chiefs insisted on annuities to help the Six Nations community survive.\n\nAccording to the Haldimand Proclamation, the original tract of land stretched from the mouth of the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]] to the river's [[Source (river or stream)|head]], and for 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) from either bank. Between 1795 and 1797, Joseph Brant sold {{convert|381480|acre|km2}} to land speculators; the property comprising the northern half of the reserve was sold for \u00a385,332. This was the highest price paid to Aboriginals up to this time for undeveloped land.\n\n[[File: Chiefs of the Six Nations at Brantford, Canada, explaining their wampum belts to Horatio Hale September 14, 1871.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Chiefs of the Six Nations explaining their [[wampum]] belts to [[Horatio Hale]], 1871]]\n\nGovernor Simcoe opposed the land sales.  The interest on the annuity promised an income to the people of \u00a35,119 per year, far more than any other Iroquois people had received.  The land speculators were unable to sell farm-size lots to settlers fast enough. By 1801, however, all the land speculators had fallen behind in their payments. Because of the lack of payments, Brant was determined to sell more land to make up for the missing payments.\n\nIn 1796, [[Lord Dorchester]] issued another deed for the land. This empowered the Aboriginals to lease or sell their land, provided they offered it first for sale to the government.  Brant rejected this deed, partly because the deed named the Six Nations as communal owners of the land. He believed the deed should be limited to the current persons living on the land.\n\nBy 1800, two-thirds of the Aboriginals had not yet adapted to the style of [[subsistence agriculture]] maintained by separate households, that the Canadian government encouraged.  Brant had hoped that sales of land to European Americans would help them develop the frontier, but conditions were difficult for such agriculture.\n\nIn 1828, chief [[John Brant (Mohawk chief)|John Brant]] was appointed resident [[wikt: superintendent|superintendent]] for the Six Nations of the Grand River.\n\nThe Six Nations people were originally given 10&nbsp;km on either side of the entire length of the Grand River, although much of the land was later sold. The ongoing [[Grand River land dispute]] is the result of disputes over the sale process. The current reserves encompass 184.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (71&nbsp;sq mi), all but 0.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in Six Nations reserve No. 40.\n\n==Communities==\nSeveral named communities exist within the Six Nations reserve:\n*Beavers Corner\n*Longboat Corners\n*Medina Corners\n*Millers Corner\n*[[Ohsweken, Ontario|Ohsweken]]\n*St. Johns\n*Sixty-Nine Corners\n*Smith Corners\n*Smoothtown\n*Sour Spring\n*Stoneridge\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Six nations of the Grand, Pow Wow Dancers 0592.jpg|thumb|Six Nations Pow Wow]]\nThey later welcomed to the reserve a group of [[Lenape|Delaware]], who speak ''[[Munsee language|Munsee]]'' ([[Lenape]]), an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]].\n\nSix Nations of the Grand River is the most populous reserve in Canada.

Some warriors of the Oneida and Tuscarora also allied with them, as warfare was highly decentralized. These nations had longstanding trade relations with the British and hoped they might stop European-American encroachment on their territories. These allies were from the Six Nations of the ''[[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]]'' or Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nAfter the colonists' victory, the British government ceded all of its territory in the colonies to their new government under a peace treaty, including that belonging to the Six Nations: without consulting them or making them party to treaty negotiations. The Crown worked to resettle native [[Loyalists]] in Canada and provide some compensation for lands lost in the new United States. The Crown also hoped to use these new settlers, both Native Americans and European Americans, to develop agriculture and towns in areas west of [[Quebec]], the territory later known as [[Upper Canada]].\n\nThe new lands granted to Six Nations reserves were all near important Canadian military targets and placed along the border to prevent any American invasion.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}<!-- whose interpretation is this? The reserves were also near existing waterways, the only means of transportation and the obvious place for settlements because of water supply --> The growth of the Six Nations community was also hampered. Land, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, granted a certain measure of power to their owners. Influential leaders such as [[Joseph Brant]] and Deseronto were prevented from granting land to business owners who could have brought industry and agriculture to their lands. Rules and laws were created to prevent the growth of political support for these men by banning all non natives from living and owning any business on reserves {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Many complained that much of lands granted were clay and rock ridden, making the land untenable {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}.\n\nAfter the war, Mohawk leaders [[John Deseronto]] and [[Joseph Brant]] met with the British officer [[Frederick Haldimand]] to discuss the loss of their lands in New York. Haldimand promised to resettle the Mohawk near the [[Bay of Quinte]], on the northeast shore of [[Lake Ontario]], in present-day [[Ontario]], Canada. Haldimand purchased from other First Nations a tract 12 by {{convert|13|mi|km}} on the Bay of Quinte, which he granted to the Mohawk. (There are of course questions about First Nations understanding of such purchase). About 200 Mohawk settled with Deseronto at what is now called the [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario]]. The group of Mohawk originally led by [[John Deseronto]], who died in the [[Deseronto|town]] named after him, settled on the Bay of Quinte known as ''Tyendinaga''. These were primarily Mohawk of the Lower Castle (of New York).\n\n===Six Nations at Grand River===\nBrant decided that he preferred to settle on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] north of Lake Erie. Mohawk of the Upper Castle joined him in settling on the Grand River, as did bands of the other Six Nations. By the [[Haldimand Proclamation]] of October 25, 1784, the government granted a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] of land to the [[Mohawk Nation]] and [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] bands in appreciation of their support for [[The Crown]] during the revolution. [[Joseph Brant]] led a large group of Iroquois to settle in what is now referred to as \"Six Nations of the Grand River.\"\n\nA 1785 census recorded 1,843 Natives living on the Grand River reserve, including 548 [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], 281 [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]], 145 [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], 262 [[Oneida nation|Oneida]], 109 [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]], and 98 [[Seneca nation|Seneca]]. There were also 400 persons from other tribes, including [[Delaware]] (Lenape), and others from southern territory, such as the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]], [[Tutelo]], and some [[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Cherokee]].<ref>Kelsay pg. 370</ref> African-American slaves were also brought to Six Nations and Brantford by Joseph Brant.

To encourage his loyalist friends to settle there, Brant gave them larger grants than the government had given other loyalists in other areas of Upper Canada. Some Canadians objected to Brant giving such land grants to whites in the reserve area. This was the beginning of attempts to curtail any growth Brant might secure for his people.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} \n\nAs the government did for European Americans, the Indian department provided the Aboriginals with some tools and other provisions for resettlement, including such items as saws, axes, [[grindstones]], and chisels. They received help in establishing schools and churches, and in acquiring farm equipment and other necessities. Conditions were extremely difficult in the first years on the frontier, as the government did not provide enough supplies or assistance to any of the resettled loyalists, neither Native Americans nor European Americans. They had to create new settlements out of woodlands. In 1785, the government built the first [[Protestant]] church in [[Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]) on the reserve; it was known as [[Mohawk Chapel|Her Majesty's Royal Chapel of the Mohawks]]. The Crown maintained its support of this chapel, and it is among only twelve [[Chapel Royal|Chapels Royal]] in the world.\n\nThe main town developed at what is now [[Brantford]]. It was first called Brant's Town after [[Joseph Brant]], who built his residence there. In 1798, it was described as a large and sprawling settlement. Brant's home was a handsome two-story house, built in a European-American style. In 1797, Brant founded one of the earliest [[Masonic Lodge]]s in Upper Canada; he achieved the rank of its [[Masonic Lodge Officers#Worshipful Master|Worshipful Master]].\n\nGovernor [[John Simcoe]] confirmed the Grant with a limited deed on January 14, 1793.  This deed did not extend to the source of the Grand River{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, territory to which the Six Nations have maintained they were entitled as described in the earlier [[Haldimand Proclamation]].  Also, this deed forbade them to sell the land to anyone but each other and the king. Led by Joseph Brant, the chiefs rejected the deed. In 1795, the Grand River chiefs empowered Joseph Brant to sell large blocks of land in the northern section, which the Aboriginals were not using at the time. They set terms of no money down because they wanted to take their payment entirely in future years as annual interest. At this time, the population on the reserve was declining; some Aboriginals left the Grand River for traditional native communities in New York. After Brant's land sales started in 1795, the population began to increase again. He and the chiefs insisted on annuities to help the Six Nations community survive.\n\nAccording to the Haldimand Proclamation, the original tract of land stretched from the mouth of the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]] to the river's [[Source (river or stream)|head]], and for 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) from either bank. Between 1795 and 1797, Joseph Brant sold {{convert|381480|acre|km2}} to land speculators; the property comprising the northern half of the reserve was sold for \u00a385,332. This was the highest price paid to Aboriginals up to this time for undeveloped land.\n\n[[File: Chiefs of the Six Nations at Brantford, Canada, explaining their wampum belts to Horatio Hale September 14, 1871.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Chiefs of the Six Nations explaining their [[wampum]] belts to [[Horatio Hale]], 1871]]\n\nGovernor Simcoe opposed the land sales.  The interest on the annuity promised an income to the people of \u00a35,119 per year, far more than any other Iroquois people had received.  The land speculators were unable to sell farm-size lots to settlers fast enough. By 1801, however, all the land speculators had fallen behind in their payments. Because of the lack of payments, Brant was determined to sell more land to make up for the missing payments.\n\nIn 1796, [[Lord Dorchester]] issued another deed for the land. This empowered the Aboriginals to lease or sell their land, provided they offered it first for sale to the government.  Brant rejected this deed, partly because the deed named the Six Nations as communal owners of the land. He believed the deed should be limited to the current persons living on the land.\n\nBy 1800, two-thirds of the Aboriginals had not yet adapted to the style of [[subsistence agriculture]] maintained by separate households, that the Canadian government encouraged.

At the turn of the calendar year, Arsenal won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position; they secured their status as champions with a draw against local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in April 2004. Their form did not continue into the domestic cups; Arsenal exited the semi-final stage of the Football League Cup and the FA Cup to eventual winners [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], respectively.

football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]] formation.\n|}\nCompared with the club's [[1997\u201398 Arsenal F.C. season|double-winning side of 1998]], only [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]] remained as first team players throughout the unbeaten run; [[Martin Keown]] featured briefly, while [[Ray Parlour]] made 25 league appearances. Defenders [[Lee Dixon]] and [[Tony Adams]] had retired from professional football in 2002 and goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] joined Manchester City a year later. [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]], signed as a right-back and defensive midfielder, was chosen to play in central defence alongside [[Sol Campbell]] after impressing during pre-season. [[Lauren (footballer)|Lauren]] who played as a midfielder for [[Real Mallorca]] was shifted as a right-back when he joined Arsenal. Wenger initially replaced left-back [[Nigel Winterburn]] with [[Sylvinho]], but an injury to the defender allowed [[Ashley Cole]] to take his place as first pick by the [[2000\u201301 Arsenal F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season. In midfield [[Gilberto Silva]] partnered Vieira, and [[Freddie Ljungberg]] and [[Robert Pires]] each played either side of the wing. [[Thierry Henry]], signed as [[Nicolas Anelka]]'s replacement in 1999, was the team's focal point in attack; he was supported most often by Bergkamp.\n\nAlthough the team were interpreted as one which organised themselves as [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u20132]], the formation with the ball was akin to [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20131\u20131|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]]. Wenger's tactics emphasised attacking football and relied on movement and interchanging, with full-backs joining in attacks. Journalist [[Michael Cox (journalist)|Michael Cox]] noted Arsenal's strengths lay on the left side of the pitch and added because the opposition focused on containing Cole, Pires and Henry, it allowed Lauren and Ljungberg to find space and cross the ball. The team were also strong on the counter, exemplified in their away performances against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news |title=Henry torments poor Leeds

football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]] formation.\n|}\nCompared with the club's [[1997\u201398 Arsenal F.C. season|double-winning side of 1998]], only [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]] remained as first team players throughout the unbeaten run; [[Martin Keown]] featured briefly, while [[Ray Parlour]] made 25 league appearances. Defenders [[Lee Dixon]] and [[Tony Adams]] had retired from professional football in 2002 and goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] joined Manchester City a year later. [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]], signed as a right-back and defensive midfielder, was chosen to play in central defence alongside [[Sol Campbell]] after impressing during pre-season. [[Lauren (footballer)|Lauren]] who played as a midfielder for [[Real Mallorca]] was shifted as a right-back when he joined Arsenal. Wenger initially replaced left-back [[Nigel Winterburn]] with [[Sylvinho]], but an injury to the defender allowed [[Ashley Cole]] to take his place as first pick by the [[2000\u201301 Arsenal F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season. In midfield [[Gilberto Silva]] partnered Vieira, and [[Freddie Ljungberg]] and [[Robert Pires]] each played either side of the wing. [[Thierry Henry]], signed as [[Nicolas Anelka]]'s replacement in 1999, was the team's focal point in attack; he was supported most often by Bergkamp.\n\nAlthough the team were interpreted as one which organised themselves as [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u20132]], the formation with the ball was akin to [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20131\u20131|4\u20134\u20131\u20131]]. Wenger's tactics emphasised attacking football and relied on movement and interchanging, with full-backs joining in attacks. Journalist [[Michael Cox (journalist)|Michael Cox]] noted Arsenal's strengths lay on the left side of the pitch and added because the opposition focused on containing Cole, Pires and Henry, it allowed Lauren and Ljungberg to find space and cross the ball. The team were also strong on the counter, exemplified in their away performances against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news |title=Henry torments poor Leeds

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] opened its new railway station in 2003, on the [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] that had closed to passengers in 1969.\n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]].
