The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25 to $125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25 to $125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied.

The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration.

(The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25 to $125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25 to $125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

It is situated at the south eastern part of the [[Peak District]], with the National Park directly to the west. The town is [[town twinning|twinned]] with the French town [[Eaubonne]]. The former spa resort [[Matlock Bath]] lies immediately south of the town on the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]. The civil parish of Matlock Town had a population in the [[2011 UK census]] of 9,543.<ref name=population /> The population of the wider Matlock urban area is approximately 20,000 (including [[Darley Dale]], [[Tansley]], [[Hackney, Derbyshire|Hackney]] and Matlock Bath).\n\nMatlock is nine miles (14&nbsp;km) south-west of [[Chesterfield]], and in easy reach of the cities of [[Derby]] (19 miles), [[Sheffield]] (20 miles), and [[Nottingham]] (29 miles); the [[Greater Manchester]] conurbation is 30 miles away. Matlock is within the [[Derbyshire Dales]] district, which also includes the towns of [[Bakewell]] and [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]], as well as Wirksworth. The headquarters of [[Derbyshire County Council]] are in the town.\n\n==History==\nThe name Matlock derives from the [[Old English]] ''m\u00e6thel'' (or ''m\u00e6\u00f0el''), meaning assembly or speech, and ''\u0101c'', meaning oak tree; thus Matlock means 'moot-oak', an oak tree where meetings are held.<ref name=mills>{{cite book |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199609086.013.9146?rskey=QJY1Mc&result=2 |title=A Dictionary of British Place Names |editor=David Mills |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Matlock |title=Matlock |work=A Key To English Placenames (English Place Name Society database) |publisher=University of Nottingham |accessdate=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503120050/http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Matlock |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 it was recorded as ''Meslach'' and in 1196 it was named ''Matlac''.<ref name=mills/> It is a former [[spa town]] that lies on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], and has prospered from both the [[hydrotherapy]] industry and the [[cotton mills|cloth mills]] constructed on the river and its tributary [[Bentley Brook]].\n\nIt was a relatively inconspicuous collection of villages in ''Wirksworth Hundred'' &mdash; composed of Matlock Town, Matlock Green, Matlock Bridge, Matlock Bank &mdash; until [[thermal spring]]s were discovered in 1698.<ref name=Matlock&MatlockBath>{{citation|title=Matlock & Matlock Bath: Water Cures |work=Matlock & Matlock Bath |publisher=The Andrews Pages |url=http://www.pd65.dial.pipex.com/matlock/water.htm |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414214527/http://www.pd65.dial.pipex.com/matlock/water.htm |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}</ref> The [[population]] increased rapidly in the 1800s, largely because of the popular [[hydropathic establishment|hydros]] which were being built.<ref name=MatlockBankOrigins&Development>{{citation |date=December 2007 |title=Matlock Bank Conservation Area |chapter=Matlock Bank: Conservation Area Appraisal. 02: Origins & Development |chapterurl=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/Images/2%20Origins%20and%20Development_tcm19-83827.pdf |publisher=Derbyshire Dales District Council |url=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/planning_and_building_control/conservation/conservation_areas/matlock_bank/default.asp |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612123825/http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/planning_and_building_control/conservation/conservation_areas/matlock_bank/default.asp |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

Matlock is also home to the [[Derbyshire Dales]] District Council as well as Matlock [[Town council]].\n\n==Governance==\nMatlock has a [[Town councils in England|town council]] (the urban equivent of a rural parish council) which is the lowest tier of local government.  The Council meets twice a month.  There are 11 Councillors who cover the area and 9 members of staff.\nMatlock Town Council's jurisdiction extends covers the Town Centre, Matlock Bank, Hurst Farm, Matlock Green, Matlock Town, Starkholmes and Riber.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Matlock Town Council|publisher=Matlock Town Council|url=http://www.matlock.gov.uk/the-council|accessdate=2015-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe second tier of local government is [[Derbyshire Dales District Council]] which covers almost a third of the mainly rural parts of the County, including the towns of Matlock, Ashbourne, Bakewell, Wirksworth and Darley Dale and over 100 villages.  The Council has 39 District Councillors elected in 25 wards.  Matlock is represented by 6 councillors in the two wards Matlock All Saints and Matlock St Giles.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Derbyshire Dales District Council|publisher=Derbyshire Dales District Council|url=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/your-council/your-representatives/councillors|accessdate=2015-08-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064234/http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/your-council/your-representatives/councillors|archivedate=18 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe top tier of local government is [[Derbyshire County Council]] that has responsibilities for the whole of Derbyshire apart from the City of Derby.  Matlock is represented by one county councillor (out of 64 councillors in total).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Derbyshire County Council|publisher=Derbyshire County Council|url=https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/councillors/default.asp|accessdate=2015-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe main offices of all three tiers of local government are sited in Matlock.  The Town Council is situated in the Imperial Rooms close to the bottom of Bank Road, the District Council is halfway up Bank Road and the County Council is at the top.\n\nAs regards national democracy, Matlock forms part of the [[Derbyshire Dales (UK Parliament constituency)]].  The MP currently (2015) is [[Patrick McLoughlin]].  He has held the seat for the Conservative Party since 1986.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Natural physical features===\nThe main physical features of the Matlock area are the hills and watercourses.  The height of the town (above mean level) varies from 91m at Causeway Lane (in the valley bottom) to 203m at the top of Wellington Street.  Matlock is overlooked by Riber Castle at 260m from the south-east and by Masson Hill at 339m from the south-west.  The first human settlement in the area was in what is now known as Old Matlock or Matlock Green.  This was where the Bentley Brook joined the River Derwent.  When the town grew in the late 19th century, the town spread up the steep hillsides to the north-east of the narrow valley bottom.\n\n[[File:Matlock - Bailey's Mill.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|Baileys (corn) Mill on Bentley Brook]]Various industries made use of the natural features:\n* The underlying bedrocks were quarried and mined.\n* The watercourses were harnessed to power corn, cloth and other mills.\n* The hillside thermal spring water gave rise to the [[Hydropathic establishment|hydros]].\nThe natural features also constrained transport links:\n* In the Derwent gorge below High Tor, the present-day A6 (Dale Road) was squeezed in beside the river.\n* From the south, the Midland Railway reached Matlock Station via a series of short tunnels constructed under the limestone of the gorge.\n* A cable tramway was constructed to tackle the very steep Bank Road (see above).\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Matlockit mineralogisches museum bonn.jpg|thumb|Specimen of Matlockite in the Mineralogical Museum, Bonn]]\nThe geology of the Matlock area is extremely complex.  Broadly speaking, the Derwent valley bottom forms a boundary between the sandstones and gritstones of the [[Dark Peak]] to the NE and the limestones of the [[White Peak]] to the SW.  There are igneous intrusions into the limestones to the SW.<ref>{{Cite map|publisher=British Geological Survey |title=Map 112(Chesterfield)|url=|edition=2012}}</ref>\n \nThis geology has been exploited by the quarrying and mining industries.  The sandstones and gritstones have been quarried as building materials (e.g. at Bentley Brook Quarries) and the limestones for building materials and the manufacture of lime (e.g. at Harvey Dale Quarries).  The igneous intrusions gave rise to valuable minerals which have been mined (e.g. in the Bonsall area), particularly for lead.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stone Quarries|publisher=The Andrews Pages|url=http://www.andrewsgen.com/matlock/stone.htm|accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> A very rare lead halide mineral called [[Matlockite]] was first discovered at nearby Bage Mine in the early 1800s, and is named after the town.<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/jrs/JRS%20Vol%2001-2.pdf Phosgenite and Matlockite in Derbyshire (Part 1)], T. Bridges, M.E. Smith, Journal of the Russell Society Volume 1, No. 2, p7-14, 1983 Retrieved on 2015-12-11</ref>\n\nThe route of the River Derwent downstream (south) of Matlock is especially interesting to geologists in that it appears to have cut its way through a limestone gorge below High Tor (120m above river level), rather than follow the \"simpler\" way to the east.  It is thought that landslips and/or glaciation may have had an influence over how the present route of the river was established.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dalton|first=Roger|title=Classic Landforms of the White Peak|publisher=The Geographical Association|date=1999|isbn=1899085602}}</ref>\n\n===Nearby places===\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = MATLOCK\n|North     = [[Chesterfield]] & [[Baslow]] \n|Northeast = [[Ashover]] & [[Clay Cross]]\n|East      = [[Shirland]]\n|Southeast = [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]]\n|South     = [[Wirksworth]] & [[Belper]] \n|Southwest = [[Peak District]]\n|West      = [[Peak District]] & [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]]\n|Northwest = [[Youlgreave]] & [[Bakewell]]\n}}\n\n===The Dimple===\nThe area on the western edge of the town, bounded on the north and east by Old Hackney Lane, Hurds Hollow, and Dimple Road, and on the south by Bakewell Road, is named as '''Dimple''', on the Ordnance Survey map.<ref name=Dimple>{{cite web | url = http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=429500&y=359500&z=120&sv=Matlock&st=3&tl=Map+of+Matlock,+Derbyshire+[City/Town/Village]&searchp=ids.srf&mapp=map.srf | title = OS Map: Matlock | accessdate = March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Flooding===\nThe Derwent has occasionally flooded, including during [[2019 United Kingdom floods|November 2019]] when large areas of England were affected.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/other-articles-clipping-dec-12-1965-1427465 |title=Tides, Tivers Flood Low London Areas - Three Deaths Caused |work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]] |location=[[Madison, Wisconsin]] |date=12 December 1965 |page=26 |url-status=live |accessdate=9 November 2019 |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/midlands-north-england-floods-woman-dies |title = Woman dies as floods devastate Midlands and north of England|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2019-11-08|last1 = Parveen|first1 = Nazia|last2 = Murphy|first2 = Simon}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Bank Road Tram===\n[[Image:Matlock Town.jpg|250px|thumb|Matlock taken from Matlock Bridge - looking up the hill of Bank Road across Crown Square (prior to bridge one way system).]]\nIn 1893, [[Matlock Cable Tramway]], a [[Cable car (railway)|cable tramway]] was built up [[Bank Road]] from [[Crown Square]] at Matlock Bridge to Wellington Street (at the top of Bank Road) with a stop halfway up at Smedley Street where [[County Hall, Matlock|Smedley's Hydro]] (built by [[John Smedley (industrialist)|John Smedley]]) was situated. Conceived by Job Smith, the tram was inspired by [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco's]] famous cable cars, and cost \u00a320,000. When it was built it was the steepest tramway in the world at a [[gradient]] of 1 in 5\u00bd, and it rose {{convert|300|ft|m}}. The [[fare]] was tuppence up, penny down. It closed in 1927<ref name=MatlockBankOrigins&Development/> after losing business to [[automobile|cars]] and [[buses]].\n\n===Railways===\n[[Image:Peakraillogo.png|120px|left|Peak Rail emblem]]In 1849, the railway came to Matlock.<ref name=MatlockBankOrigins&Development/> [[Matlock railway station]] was opened on the [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], later the [[Midland Railway|Midland]] line between [[London]] and [[Manchester]], until the section between Matlock and [[Buxton]] was closed in 1968 following the [[Beeching cuts]]. Network Rail considered re-opening the line, with a study carried out by the county council. Although it proved to be unfeasible in the short term, the track bed will be kept free of development as the study showed that the line could be economically viable from around 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/transport_roads/transport_planning/derby_manchester_rail_project/default.asp|title=Derby to Manchester rail project|publisher=Derbyshire County Council|accessdate=2010-12-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050829/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/transport_roads/transport_planning/derby_manchester_rail_project/default.asp|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The section from Wye Dale (about {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of Buxton) to Coombs viaduct, a point about a mile south-east of Bakewell, has now become the [[Monsal Trail]], an {{convert|8.5|mi|km|adj=on}} walk and cycle trail.\n\nTrains still run between Matlock and [[Derby]] on the [[Derwent Valley Line]]. [[Peak Rail]], a [[preserved railway]], runs [[steam train]]s on a section of the closed line between Matlock, [[Darley Dale]] and [[Rowsley]]. Previously it used its own station, [[Matlock Riverside railway station|Matlock Riverside]], a short distance to the north of the mainline station, however as of 2011 both Peak Rail and trains on the Derwent Valley Line share the same station.\n\n==Hall Leys Park==\n[[Image:Matlock Tramway - Crown Square tram stop 06-08-06.jpg|The old tram shelter in the park|thumb]]\nHall Leys Park is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[park|public park]] in the centre of Matlock, [[Derbyshire]] which opened in 1898. It lies between the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] to the south and Causeway Lane to the north. The park has many facilities and in 2004\u20132005 underwent major regeneration as part of the Matlock Parks Project with funding from the [[Millennium Commission]].\n\nAt the Crown Square/Matlock Bridge end of the park there is the town's [[war memorial]] and a [[wishing well]]. Beside this there is the shelter from the former [[Cable car (railway)|cable tramway]] which was moved to the park when the tramway ceased to operate in 1927.\n\nMoving away from Crown Square there is, next, a large grass area and some [[tennis court]]s. As part of the refurbishments which took place, the old [[grass court|grass tennis courts]] were replaced with a [[skatepark|skateboard park]].\n\n[[File:Matlock - Hall Leys Park Bandstand.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|Hall Leys Park bandstand from footbridge over River Derwent]]In the centre of the park is the Victorian [[bandstand]] which is used regularly in the summer months by local [[brass band]]s and for events such as the annual Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend - held on the first weekend of December. Beside the bandstand is a footbridge over the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] which has markings indicating the height of several floods that hit the town in the 1960s and 1970s. The caf\u00e9, on the opposite side of the bandstand, has similar markings for other floods.\n\nHall Leys Park is now a central part of the town's flood protection. The wall which surrounds the northern side of the park has the ability to have the footways sealed with sheets of wood which would [[dam]] the progress of any overflow from the river and turn the entire park into a large [[reservoir]]. Further down the park there is a [[putting green]] and a Crown Green [[Bowls]] green.\n\nA boating lake, with several small islands, is home to a large number of birds, including [[duck]]s and [[moorhen]]s as well as being host to the longest running [[pleasure craft|pleasure boats]] in the country.\n\nA miniature railway runs half the length of the park along the river but, due to the lack of any turning space, the return journey is made in reverse.\n\nAt the far end of the park is a [[child]]ren's [[playground]] which was significantly upgraded in 2005.\n\nHall Leys Park is occasionally the site for visiting \"Continental Markets\" and, since the summer of 2006, regular \"Farmers' Markets\". It is also the centre of the Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend held annually on the first weekend of December.\n\n==Bank Road==\nBank Road runs from [[Crown Square]] up Matlock Bank, a steep [[hill]] which gives the road its name, to Wellington Street. Although many consider the whole incline to be Bank Road, just over halfway up beyond Smedley Street the road is called Rutland Street.\nBank Road has many local landmark buildings along it - from the bottom of the hill (Crown Square) travelling north:\n\n[[File:Matlock - Crown Buildings.JPG|thumb|top|right|Crown Buildings]]\n*'''The Crown Hotel''' - the original site of the hotel which gave its name to Crown Square is now a [[building society]] office.

The Youth Hostel opened in 1983 and closed on 30 September 2007.<ref name=\"MBankCAArch\"/>\n*'''Matlock Methodist & United Reformed Church''' - originally Matlock Wesleyan Chapel, and later the Trinity Methodist Church. The church was designed by C.O. Ellison of Liverpool, with additions designed by Horace G. Bradley. The neo-gothic church was originally built in 1882 without the slender steeple, which is now a landmark feature reaching above the roofs of neighbouring buildings, and, from higher levels, an elegant feature against the backdrop of the hills beyond. The Manse was built at the west of the site, fronting New Street.<ref name=\"MBankCAArch\"/>\n*'''Old Sunday School''' which is now a [[Bed and breakfast|B&B]].\n*'''Old Methodist Church''' - the Primitive Methodist congregation was founded in 1838, although the current church on Bank Road, opposite the entrance to County Hall, was rebuilt in 1856 and the adjacent School Room below was added in 1878.<ref name=\"MBankCAArch\"/> Until recently, the Old Methodist Church housed the Matlock [[Wurlitzer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theatreorgans.com/au/opus/UPDATES/UD2192.htm|title=Matlock Wurlitzer|publisher=Theatre Organs website|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>\n[[File:Matlock - County Offices frontage.jpg|thumb|top|right|County Hall with Winter Gardens in foreground]]\n*'''[[County Hall, Matlock|County Hall]]''' - formerly Smedley\u2019s Hydro, is a grade II listed building which dominates Matlock Bank. The earliest (western) section seen today was built in {{circa|lk=no|1867}} by Smedley. Much of today's building was added after Smedley\u2019s death in 1874. The first phase, in 1881, included the entrance hall and staircase, now in the middle section. In 1886, the eastern section was added by architect George Statham of Nottingham. Later extensions include the tall chimney, impressive for its height on the already prominent site, along with boiler house and bath in 1894. The domed glass Winter Gardens, which housed a ballroom, and the northern block on the other side of Smedley Street were added in 1901. The northern block was linked by the unusual two storey bridge over Smedley Street.<ref name=\"MBankCAArch\"/> [[File:Matlock - The Gate Inn.JPG|thumb|top|right|The Gate and, across Bank Road, County Hall]] The hydro closed in 1955 and re-opened in 1956 as \u201cCounty Offices\u201d, when [[Derbyshire County Council]] moved its headquarters from the old [[County Hall, Derby|County Hall in Derby]].

It forms part of the Derby to Manchester road (A6) and has very many bends.\nDale Road, like Bank Road (see previous section), contains a large number of examples of Victorian architecture, although only four are listed by English Heritage.  However all buildings on Dale Road are included in two conservation areas created by Derbyshire Dales District Council.  These conservation areas are called \"Matlock Bridge\" (from the bridge over the Derwent to the railway bridge over Dale Road), then \"Matlock Dale\" to the outskirts of Matlock Bath.<ref name=\"MBridgeCAArch\"/><ref name=\"MDaleCAArch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/images/documents/M/Matlock%20Dale%20Conservation%20Area%20Map.pdf/matlock-bridge|title=Matlock Dale Conservation Area Map|publisher=Derbyshire Dales District Council|accessdate=2015-07-30}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nIn this section, the main features of Dale Road are described, starting at Matlock Bridge and then proceeding in a southerly direction until the High Tor Hotel.\n\n*'''Railway Station and Station House''' - The railway station and the nearby station house were both designed by [[Joseph Paxton]] around 1850, as part of the building of the Midland Railway's Derby to Buxton route.

The first stone bridge was constructed over or close to the site of a ford in the mid 13th century.  It was only a single carriageway in width and remained so for 550 years.  In the 1890s there were discussions regarding the need for a wider bridge to be able to cope with the increasing road traffic.  A new bridge was proposed which would have involved the demolition of the existing.  However, a decision was taken to double the width of the existing bridge. This work was undertaken in 1903-4.  The bridge was made one-way to vehicular traffic at time of building of the access road to the superstore in Cawdor Quarry in 2007.  The bridge is listed as Grade II* by English Heritage.<ref name=\"MBridgeCAArch\"/>\n\n[[File:Matlock - HSBC Bank on Dale Road (Geograph-2242878-by-Dave-Bevis).jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|HSBC Bank]]\n[[File:Matlock - NatWest Bank.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|NatWest Bank]]\n[[File:Matlock - former market hall.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|Market Hall with Queens Head beyond]]\n*'''RBS Bank (now closed)''' - There is a pedestrian access to this bank from Dale Road, although its postal address is Snitterton Road.

The Market Hall was constructed in 1867-68. The ground floor was used as a general market house with 12 shop units while the upper floor was used for assemblies, public meetings and entertainments.  The architectural style chosen for this was that of the then-popular Gothic Revival. The building was also an important source of civic pride, designed to impress and sporting a row of carved heraldic shields across its fa\u00e7ade.

It was built in the former Harveydale limestone quarry as the headquarters of Derbyshire Stone Ltd and named after a leading figure in the company.

The civil parish of Matlock Town had a population in the [[2011 UK census]] of 9,543.<ref name=population /> The population of the wider Matlock urban area is approximately 20,000 (including [[Darley Dale]], [[Tansley]], [[Hackney, Derbyshire|Hackney]] and Matlock Bath).\n\nMatlock is nine miles (14&nbsp;km) south-west of [[Chesterfield]], and in easy reach of the cities of [[Derby]] (19 miles), [[Sheffield]] (20 miles), and [[Nottingham]] (29 miles); the [[Greater Manchester]] conurbation is 30 miles away. Matlock is within the [[Derbyshire Dales]] district, which also includes the towns of [[Bakewell]] and [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]], as well as Wirksworth. The headquarters of [[Derbyshire County Council]] are in the town.\n\n==History==\nThe name Matlock derives from the [[Old English]] ''m\u00e6thel'' (or ''m\u00e6\u00f0el''), meaning assembly or speech, and ''\u0101c'', meaning oak tree; thus Matlock means 'moot-oak', an oak tree where meetings are held.<ref name=mills>{{cite book |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199609086.013.9146?rskey=QJY1Mc&result=2 |title=A Dictionary of British Place Names |editor=David Mills |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Matlock |title=Matlock |work=A Key To English Placenames (English Place Name Society database) |publisher=University of Nottingham |accessdate=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503120050/http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Matlock |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 it was recorded as ''Meslach'' and in 1196 it was named ''Matlac''.<ref name=mills/> It is a former [[spa town]] that lies on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], and has prospered from both the [[hydrotherapy]] industry and the [[cotton mills|cloth mills]] constructed on the river and its tributary [[Bentley Brook]].\n\nIt was a relatively inconspicuous collection of villages in ''Wirksworth Hundred'' &mdash; composed of Matlock Town, Matlock Green, Matlock Bridge, Matlock Bank &mdash; until [[thermal spring]]s were discovered in 1698.<ref name=Matlock&MatlockBath>{{citation|title=Matlock & Matlock Bath: Water Cures |work=Matlock & Matlock Bath |publisher=The Andrews Pages |url=http://www.pd65.dial.pipex.com/matlock/water.htm |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414214527/http://www.pd65.dial.pipex.com/matlock/water.htm |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}</ref> The [[population]] increased rapidly in the 1800s, largely because of the popular [[hydropathic establishment|hydros]] which were being built.<ref name=MatlockBankOrigins&Development>{{citation |date=December 2007 |title=Matlock Bank Conservation Area |chapter=Matlock Bank: Conservation Area Appraisal. 02: Origins & Development |chapterurl=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/Images/2%20Origins%20and%20Development_tcm19-83827.pdf |publisher=Derbyshire Dales District Council |url=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/planning_and_building_control/conservation/conservation_areas/matlock_bank/default.asp |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612123825/http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/planning_and_building_control/conservation/conservation_areas/matlock_bank/default.asp |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

Matlock is also home to the [[Derbyshire Dales]] District Council as well as Matlock [[Town council]].\n\n==Governance==\nMatlock has a [[Town councils in England|town council]] (the urban equivent of a rural parish council) which is the lowest tier of local government.  The Council meets twice a month.  There are 11 Councillors who cover the area and 9 members of staff.\nMatlock Town Council's jurisdiction extends covers the Town Centre, Matlock Bank, Hurst Farm, Matlock Green, Matlock Town, Starkholmes and Riber.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Matlock Town Council|publisher=Matlock Town Council|url=http://www.matlock.gov.uk/the-council|accessdate=2015-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe second tier of local government is [[Derbyshire Dales District Council]] which covers almost a third of the mainly rural parts of the County, including the towns of Matlock, Ashbourne, Bakewell, Wirksworth and Darley Dale and over 100 villages.  The Council has 39 District Councillors elected in 25 wards.  Matlock is represented by 6 councillors in the two wards Matlock All Saints and Matlock St Giles.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Derbyshire Dales District Council|publisher=Derbyshire Dales District Council|url=http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/your-council/your-representatives/councillors|accessdate=2015-08-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064234/http://www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/your-council/your-representatives/councillors|archivedate=18 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe top tier of local government is [[Derbyshire County Council]] that has responsibilities for the whole of Derbyshire apart from the City of Derby.

The Town Council is situated in the Imperial Rooms close to the bottom of Bank Road, the District Council is halfway up Bank Road and the County Council is at the top.\n\nAs regards national democracy, Matlock forms part of the [[Derbyshire Dales (UK Parliament constituency)]].  The MP currently (2015) is [[Patrick McLoughlin]].  He has held the seat for the Conservative Party since 1986.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Natural physical features===\nThe main physical features of the Matlock area are the hills and watercourses.  The height of the town (above mean level) varies from 91m at Causeway Lane (in the valley bottom) to 203m at the top of Wellington Street.  Matlock is overlooked by Riber Castle at 260m from the south-east and by Masson Hill at 339m from the south-west.  The first human settlement in the area was in what is now known as Old Matlock or Matlock Green.  This was where the Bentley Brook joined the River Derwent.  When the town grew in the late 19th century, the town spread up the steep hillsides to the north-east of the narrow valley bottom.\n\n[[File:Matlock - Bailey's Mill.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|Baileys (corn) Mill on Bentley Brook]]Various industries made use of the natural features:\n* The underlying bedrocks were quarried and mined.\n* The watercourses were harnessed to power corn, cloth and other mills.\n* The hillside thermal spring water gave rise to the [[Hydropathic establishment|hydros]].\nThe natural features also constrained transport links:\n* In the Derwent gorge below High Tor, the present-day A6 (Dale Road) was squeezed in beside the river.\n* From the south, the Midland Railway reached Matlock Station via a series of short tunnels constructed under the limestone of the gorge.\n* A cable tramway was constructed to tackle the very steep Bank Road (see above).\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Matlockit mineralogisches museum bonn.jpg|thumb|Specimen of Matlockite in the Mineralogical Museum, Bonn]]\nThe geology of the Matlock area is extremely complex.  Broadly speaking, the Derwent valley bottom forms a boundary between the sandstones and gritstones of the [[Dark Peak]] to the NE and the limestones of the [[White Peak]] to the SW.  There are igneous intrusions into the limestones to the SW.<ref>{{Cite map|publisher=British Geological Survey |title=Map 112(Chesterfield)|url=|edition=2012}}</ref>\n \nThis geology has been exploited by the quarrying and mining industries.  The sandstones and gritstones have been quarried as building materials (e.g. at Bentley Brook Quarries) and the limestones for building materials and the manufacture of lime (e.g. at Harvey Dale Quarries).  The igneous intrusions gave rise to valuable minerals which have been mined (e.g. in the Bonsall area), particularly for lead.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stone Quarries|publisher=The Andrews Pages|url=http://www.andrewsgen.com/matlock/stone.htm|accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> A very rare lead halide mineral called [[Matlockite]] was first discovered at nearby Bage Mine in the early 1800s, and is named after the town.<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/jrs/JRS%20Vol%2001-2.pdf Phosgenite and Matlockite in Derbyshire (Part 1)], T. Bridges, M.E. Smith, Journal of the Russell Society Volume 1, No. 2, p7-14, 1983 Retrieved on 2015-12-11</ref>\n\nThe route of the River Derwent downstream (south) of Matlock is especially interesting to geologists in that it appears to have cut its way through a limestone gorge below High Tor (120m above river level), rather than follow the \"simpler\" way to the east.  It is thought that landslips and/or glaciation may have had an influence over how the present route of the river was established.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dalton|first=Roger|title=Classic Landforms of the White Peak|publisher=The Geographical Association|date=1999|isbn=1899085602}}</ref>\n\n===Nearby places===\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = MATLOCK\n|North     = [[Chesterfield]] & [[Baslow]] \n|Northeast = [[Ashover]] & [[Clay Cross]]\n|East      = [[Shirland]]\n|Southeast = [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]]\n|South     = [[Wirksworth]] & [[Belper]] \n|Southwest = [[Peak District]]\n|West      = [[Peak District]] & [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]]\n|Northwest = [[Youlgreave]] & [[Bakewell]]\n}}\n\n===The Dimple===\nThe area on the western edge of the town, bounded on the north and east by Old Hackney Lane, Hurds Hollow, and Dimple Road, and on the south by Bakewell Road, is named as '''Dimple''', on the Ordnance Survey map.<ref name=Dimple>{{cite web | url = http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=429500&y=359500&z=120&sv=Matlock&st=3&tl=Map+of+Matlock,+Derbyshire+[City/Town/Village]&searchp=ids.srf&mapp=map.srf | title = OS Map: Matlock | accessdate = March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Flooding===\nThe Derwent has occasionally flooded, including during [[2019 United Kingdom floods|November 2019]] when large areas of England were affected.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/other-articles-clipping-dec-12-1965-1427465 |title=Tides, Tivers Flood Low London Areas - Three Deaths Caused |work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]] |location=[[Madison, Wisconsin]] |date=12 December 1965 |page=26 |url-status=live |accessdate=9 November 2019 |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/midlands-north-england-floods-woman-dies |title = Woman dies as floods devastate Midlands and north of England|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2019-11-08|last1 = Parveen|first1 = Nazia|last2 = Murphy|first2 = Simon}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Bank Road Tram===\n[[Image:Matlock Town.jpg|250px|thumb|Matlock taken from Matlock Bridge - looking up the hill of Bank Road across Crown Square (prior to bridge one way system).]]\nIn 1893, [[Matlock Cable Tramway]], a [[Cable car (railway)|cable tramway]] was built up [[Bank Road]] from [[Crown Square]] at Matlock Bridge to Wellington Street (at the top of Bank Road) with a stop halfway up at Smedley Street where [[County Hall, Matlock|Smedley's Hydro]] (built by [[John Smedley (industrialist)|John Smedley]]) was situated. Conceived by Job Smith, the tram was inspired by [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco's]] famous cable cars, and cost \u00a320,000. When it was built it was the steepest tramway in the world at a [[gradient]] of 1 in 5\u00bd, and it rose {{convert|300|ft|m}}. The [[fare]] was tuppence up, penny down. It closed in 1927<ref name=MatlockBankOrigins&Development/> after losing business to [[automobile|cars]] and [[buses]].\n\n===Railways===\n[[Image:Peakraillogo.png|120px|left|Peak Rail emblem]]In 1849, the railway came to Matlock.<ref name=MatlockBankOrigins&Development/> [[Matlock railway station]] was opened on the [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], later the [[Midland Railway|Midland]] line between [[London]] and [[Manchester]], until the section between Matlock and [[Buxton]] was closed in 1968 following the [[Beeching cuts]]. Network Rail considered re-opening the line, with a study carried out by the county council. Although it proved to be unfeasible in the short term, the track bed will be kept free of development as the study showed that the line could be economically viable from around 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/transport_roads/transport_planning/derby_manchester_rail_project/default.asp|title=Derby to Manchester rail project|publisher=Derbyshire County Council|accessdate=2010-12-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050829/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/transport_roads/transport_planning/derby_manchester_rail_project/default.asp|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The section from Wye Dale (about {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of Buxton) to Coombs viaduct, a point about a mile south-east of Bakewell, has now become the [[Monsal Trail]], an {{convert|8.5|mi|km|adj=on}} walk and cycle trail.\n\nTrains still run between Matlock and [[Derby]] on the [[Derwent Valley Line]]. [[Peak Rail]], a [[preserved railway]], runs [[steam train]]s on a section of the closed line between Matlock, [[Darley Dale]] and [[Rowsley]]. Previously it used its own station, [[Matlock Riverside railway station|Matlock Riverside]], a short distance to the north of the mainline station, however as of 2011 both Peak Rail and trains on the Derwent Valley Line share the same station.\n\n==Hall Leys Park==\n[[Image:Matlock Tramway - Crown Square tram stop 06-08-06.jpg|The old tram shelter in the park|thumb]]\nHall Leys Park is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[park|public park]] in the centre of Matlock, [[Derbyshire]] which opened in 1898. It lies between the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] to the south and Causeway Lane to the north. The park has many facilities and in 2004\u20132005 underwent major regeneration as part of the Matlock Parks Project with funding from the [[Millennium Commission]].\n\nAt the Crown Square/Matlock Bridge end of the park there is the town's [[war memorial]] and a [[wishing well]]. Beside this there is the shelter from the former [[Cable car (railway)|cable tramway]] which was moved to the park when the tramway ceased to operate in 1927.\n\nMoving away from Crown Square there is, next, a large grass area and some [[tennis court]]s. As part of the refurbishments which took place, the old [[grass court|grass tennis courts]] were replaced with a [[skatepark|skateboard park]].\n\n[[File:Matlock - Hall Leys Park Bandstand.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|Hall Leys Park bandstand from footbridge over River Derwent]]In the centre of the park is the Victorian [[bandstand]] which is used regularly in the summer months by local [[brass band]]s and for events such as the annual Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend - held on the first weekend of December. Beside the bandstand is a footbridge over the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] which has markings indicating the height of several floods that hit the town in the 1960s and 1970s. The caf\u00e9, on the opposite side of the bandstand, has similar markings for other floods.\n\nHall Leys Park is now a central part of the town's flood protection. The wall which surrounds the northern side of the park has the ability to have the footways sealed with sheets of wood which would [[dam]] the progress of any overflow from the river and turn the entire park into a large [[reservoir]]. Further down the park there is a [[putting green]] and a Crown Green [[Bowls]] green.\n\nA boating lake, with several small islands, is home to a large number of birds, including [[duck]]s and [[moorhen]]s as well as being host to the longest running [[pleasure craft|pleasure boats]] in the country.\n\nA miniature railway runs half the length of the park along the river but, due to the lack of any turning space, the return journey is made in reverse.\n\nAt the far end of the park is a [[child]]ren's [[playground]] which was significantly upgraded in 2005.\n\nHall Leys Park is occasionally the site for visiting \"Continental Markets\" and, since the summer of 2006, regular \"Farmers' Markets\". It is also the centre of the Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend held annually on the first weekend of December.\n\n==Bank Road==\nBank Road runs from [[Crown Square]] up Matlock Bank, a steep [[hill]] which gives the road its name, to Wellington Street. Although many consider the whole incline to be Bank Road, just over halfway up beyond Smedley Street the road is called Rutland Street.\nBank Road has many local landmark buildings along it - from the bottom of the hill (Crown Square) travelling north:\n\n[[File:Matlock - Crown Buildings.JPG|thumb|top|right|Crown Buildings]]\n*'''The Crown Hotel''' - the original site of the hotel which gave its name to Crown Square is now a [[building society]] office.

The earliest (western) section seen today was built in {{circa|lk=no|1867}} by Smedley. Much of today's building was added after Smedley\u2019s death in 1874. The first phase, in 1881, included the entrance hall and staircase, now in the middle section. In 1886, the eastern section was added by architect George Statham of Nottingham. Later extensions include the tall chimney, impressive for its height on the already prominent site, along with boiler house and bath in 1894. The domed glass Winter Gardens, which housed a ballroom, and the northern block on the other side of Smedley Street were added in 1901. The northern block was linked by the unusual two storey bridge over Smedley Street.<ref name=\"MBankCAArch\"/> [[File:Matlock - The Gate Inn.JPG|thumb|top|right|The Gate and, across Bank Road, County Hall]] The hydro closed in 1955 and re-opened in 1956 as \u201cCounty Offices\u201d, when [[Derbyshire County Council]] moved its headquarters from the old [[County Hall, Derby|County Hall in Derby]].

In the 1890s there were discussions regarding the need for a wider bridge to be able to cope with the increasing road traffic.  A new bridge was proposed which would have involved the demolition of the existing.  However, a decision was taken to double the width of the existing bridge. This work was undertaken in 1903-4.  The bridge was made one-way to vehicular traffic at time of building of the access road to the superstore in Cawdor Quarry in 2007.  The bridge is listed as Grade II* by English Heritage.<ref name=\"MBridgeCAArch\"/>\n\n[[File:Matlock - HSBC Bank on Dale Road (Geograph-2242878-by-Dave-Bevis).jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|HSBC Bank]]\n[[File:Matlock - NatWest Bank.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|NatWest Bank]]\n[[File:Matlock - former market hall.jpg|thumb|top|right|alt=|Market Hall with Queens Head beyond]]\n*'''RBS Bank (now closed)''' - There is a pedestrian access to this bank from Dale Road, although its postal address is Snitterton Road.

The Market Hall was constructed in 1867-68. The ground floor was used as a general market house with 12 shop units while the upper floor was used for assemblies, public meetings and entertainments.  The architectural style chosen for this was that of the then-popular Gothic Revival. The building was also an important source of civic pride, designed to impress and sporting a row of carved heraldic shields across its fa\u00e7ade.

He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.

One of the movies we really talked about a lot when we were conceiving the show was [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' where he went back to really doing as many effects as possible in camera and figuring out ways to do that. One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where [[Beanie Feldstein]]'s character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking a long and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree. I think there's something about that old fashioned way that makes things more interesting than when you can tell it's digital and rubbery and fake looking\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-showrunner-interview/ |title=\u2018What We Do in the Shadows\u2019 Showrunner Teases Supernatural Orgies, \u2018Blade\u2019 Vampires, and More [Interview] |website=/Film |first=Fred |last=Topel |date=March 26, 2019 |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAmong the cinematographers D.J.

Our take, however, was that the Staten Island vampires have let their place go. The former glory is evident but now exists in a worn, faded and distressed state.

He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.
