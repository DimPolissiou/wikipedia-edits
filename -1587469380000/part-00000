He also owned a large silver-gilt and enamel-mounted leather desk folio, with the initial N 11 and the corners decorated with Imperial eagles.

Before this time, the story was unknown in [[Austria]]. The Radetzky legend is however based on this book, which claims that a Count Attems, an [[adjutant]] to the emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] gave a notice from Radetzky about the situation in [[Lombardy]] and mentioned a tasty veal steak in a margin note. After Radetzky had returned, the emperor personally requested the recipe from him.<ref name=\"pohl\" />\n\nPohl relates this anecdote with the words: \"This story is scientifically meaningless, it does not cite any sources and it is not mentioned [\u2026] in the literature about Radetzky. No such Count Attems appears in any biographical work about the Austrian monarchy, which would have corresponded to this time and position.\"<ref name=\"pohl\" />\n\nPohl doubts that Wiener schnitzel came from Italy at all, with the basis that in the other \"imported dishes\" in [[Austrian cuisine]], the original concept is mentioned, even if in Germanised form, such as in [[goulash]] or [[pancake]]s, and the schnitzel does not appear even in specialised cookbooks about [[Italian cuisine]].<ref>Pohl, Heinz Dieter: [http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/pohl1061.pdf Zur bairisch-\u00f6sterreichischen K\u00fcchensprache] (PDF)</ref>\n\nPohl hints that there had been other dishes in Austrian cuisine, before the Schnitzel, that were breaded and deep fried, such as the popular ''Backhendl'', which was first mentioned in a cookbook from 1719. The Schnitzel was then mentioned in the 19th century as ''{{lang|de|Wiener Schnitzel}}'' analogically to the ''{{lang|de|[[Wiener Backhendl]]}}''.<ref name=\"pohl\" />\n\nDocuments in the Milan archive of Saint Ambrose dated 1148 use the [[Latin]] name ''{{lang|la|lumbolos cum panitio}}'',<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Wiener Schnitzel |url=http://kitchenproject.com/history/Schnitzel/Wienerschnitzel.htm |website=kitchenproject.com |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> which can be translated as \"little chops with breadcrumbs\". This can be a hint that a dish similar to the ''{{lang|it|[[cotoletta alla milanese]]}}'' already existed at that time.\n\nIn 1887, [[Edward Frederick Knight|E. F. Knight]] wrote of a Wienerschnitzel ordered in a [[Rotterdam]] cafe, \"as far as I could make out, the lowest layer of a Wienerschnitzel consists of juicy veal steaks and slices of lemon peel; the next layer is composed of sardines; then come sliced gherkins, capers, and diverse mysteries; a delicate sauce flavours the whole, and the result is a gastronomic dream.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The \"Falcon\" On the Baltic: A Coasting Voyage From Hammersmith to Copenhagen in a Three-Ton Yacht |first=E. F. |last=Knight |date=1888 |page=76}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\n[[File:Wiener Schnitzel at restaurant Faro, Helsinki.jpg|thumb|right|Whereas the original Austrian Wiener schnitzel only includes lemon and parsley as garnishes, in the Nordic countries it is typically also garnished with a slice of anchovy and capers.<ref>Snellman.fi: [https://www.snellman.fi/fi/reseptit/wieninleike ''Wieninleike resepit ja ohje''] (in Finnish): ''Ja muualla kuin It\u00e4vallassa, saa wieninleike usein seurakseen my\u00f6s anjovista ja kapriksia, josta muodostuukin kerrassaan herkullinen yhdistelm\u00e4!'' (\"And outside Austria, the Wiener schnitzel is often accompanied by anchovy and capers which make a delicious combination!\")</ref>]]\nThe dish is prepared from veal slices, butterfly cut, about {{convert|4|mm}} thin and lightly pounded flat, slightly salted, and rolled in flour, whipped eggs, and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs must not be pressed into the meat, so that they stay dry and can be \"souffl\u00e9d\". Finally the Schnitzel is fried in a good proportion of [[lard]] or [[clarified butter]] at a temperature from 160 to 170&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref>{{cite web |title=Nur mal so: Wiener Schnitzel ist Kalbfleisch, kein Schnitzel aus dem Toaster |url=http://www.focus.de/gesundheit/ernaehrung/gesundessen/nur-mal-so-wiener-schnitzel-ist-kalbfleisch-kein-schnitzel-aus-dem-toaster-kommentar_851318.html |publisher=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus.de]] |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=27 March 2014 |language=German}}</ref> until it is golden yellow. The Schnitzel must swim in the fat, otherwise it will not cook evenly: the fat cools too much and intrudes into the bread crumbs, moistening them. During the frying the Schnitzel is repeatedly slightly tossed around the pan. Also during the frying, fat can be scooped from the pan with a spoon and poured onto the meat. The Schnitzel is cooked after it turns golden yellow or brown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanfoodguide.com/schnitzel.cfm |title=Wiener Schnitzel \u2013 Tips for Preparing a Wiener Schnitzel |publisher=German Food Guide |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe dish is traditionally served in Austria with [[Lettuce#Cultivars (varieties)|Butterhead lettuce]] tossed with a sweetened [[vinaigrette]] dressing, optionally with chopped chives or onions), [[potato salad]], cucumber salad, or parsley potatoes. Currently{{when|date=November 2019}} it is also served with rice, [[french fries]] or roasted potatoes. In earlier days, the garnish consisted of capers and [[Anchovies as food|anchovies]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hampel |first1=Friedrich - executive chef of the imperial court|title=Lucullus. Handbuch der Wiener Kochkunst |date=1915 |location=Vienna |chapter=Recipe No. 147}}</ref>, nowadays a lemon slice and parsley are more common.\n\n== Similar dishes ==\n[[File:Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein.jpg|thumb|Pork schnitzel variation stuffed with fried mushrooms and onions (''Fuhrmann Schnitzel vom Schwein''), served with mashed potato and side salad]]\n\nA popular variation is made with [[pork]] instead of veal, because pork is cheaper than veal (usually about half the price). To avoid mixing up different products, the Austrian and German food committees have decided that a \"Wiener Schnitzel\" must be made of veal. A Schnitzel made of pork can be called \"Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein\" (''Viennese schnitzel from pork'') or \"Schnitzel Wiener Art\" (''Viennese style schnitzel'').\n\nSimilar dishes to Wiener schnitzel include ''{{lang|de|[[Surschnitzel]]}}'' (from [[curing (food preservation)|cured]] meat), and breaded turkey or chicken steaks. Similarly prepared dishes include ''{{lang|it|[[cotoletta alla milanese]]}}'', [[Cordon bleu (dish)|schnitzel cordon bleu]] filled with [[ham]] and [[cheese]]<ref>[http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/product.aspx?id=131 Cordon bleu], Verein Kulinarisches Erbe der Schweiz. Accessed on 27 December 2008.</ref> and ''[[Pariser Schnitzel]]''. The American [[chicken-fried steak]] is often said to be closely related to Wiener schnitzel, the result of the adaptation of the recipe by German or Austrian immigrants to the [[Texas Hill Country]] to locally available ingredients.<ref name=\"ohs\">{{cite web  | last = Weaver  | first = Bobby  | title = Chicken-Fried Steak  | work = Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture  | publisher = Oklahoma Historical Society  | date =   | url = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CH039.html  | accessdate = January 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Tonkatsu]] is a similar, fried pork cutlet from [[Japanese cuisine]], is thicker than its European counterparts and widespread in Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the [[Southern Cone]], particularly in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], a similar dish is [[milanesa]], often served with french fries or mashed potatoes.\n\nIn [[Israel]], schnitzel is extremely popular, first introduced by European Jews who immigrated to Israel during the middle decades of the twentieth century.  Due to food shortages at that time and the high cost of meat and veal, the local version was made of chicken breast, which was less expensive.

No such Count Attems appears in any biographical work about the Austrian monarchy, which would have corresponded to this time and position.\"<ref name=\"pohl\" />\n\nPohl doubts that Wiener schnitzel came from Italy at all, with the basis that in the other \"imported dishes\" in [[Austrian cuisine]], the original concept is mentioned, even if in Germanised form, such as in [[goulash]] or [[pancake]]s, and the schnitzel does not appear even in specialised cookbooks about [[Italian cuisine]].<ref>Pohl, Heinz Dieter: [http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/pohl1061.pdf Zur bairisch-\u00f6sterreichischen K\u00fcchensprache] (PDF)</ref>\n\nPohl hints that there had been other dishes in Austrian cuisine, before the Schnitzel, that were breaded and deep fried, such as the popular ''Backhendl'', which was first mentioned in a cookbook from 1719. The Schnitzel was then mentioned in the 19th century as ''{{lang|de|Wiener Schnitzel}}'' analogically to the ''{{lang|de|[[Wiener Backhendl]]}}''.<ref name=\"pohl\" />\n\nDocuments in the Milan archive of Saint Ambrose dated 1148 use the [[Latin]] name ''{{lang|la|lumbolos cum panitio}}'',<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Wiener Schnitzel |url=http://kitchenproject.com/history/Schnitzel/Wienerschnitzel.htm |website=kitchenproject.com |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> which can be translated as \"little chops with breadcrumbs\". This can be a hint that a dish similar to the ''{{lang|it|[[cotoletta alla milanese]]}}'' already existed at that time.\n\nIn 1887, [[Edward Frederick Knight|E. F. Knight]] wrote of a Wienerschnitzel ordered in a [[Rotterdam]] cafe, \"as far as I could make out, the lowest layer of a Wienerschnitzel consists of juicy veal steaks and slices of lemon peel; the next layer is composed of sardines; then come sliced gherkins, capers, and diverse mysteries; a delicate sauce flavours the whole, and the result is a gastronomic dream.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The \"Falcon\" On the Baltic: A Coasting Voyage From Hammersmith to Copenhagen in a Three-Ton Yacht |first=E.

The bread crumbs must not be pressed into the meat, so that they stay dry and can be \"souffl\u00e9d\".

The Schnitzel must swim in the fat, otherwise it will not cook evenly: the fat cools too much and intrudes into the bread crumbs, moistening them. During the frying the Schnitzel is repeatedly slightly tossed around the pan. Also during the frying, fat can be scooped from the pan with a spoon and poured onto the meat. The Schnitzel is cooked after it turns golden yellow or brown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanfoodguide.com/schnitzel.cfm |title=Wiener Schnitzel \u2013 Tips for Preparing a Wiener Schnitzel |publisher=German Food Guide |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe dish is traditionally served in Austria with [[Lettuce#Cultivars (varieties)|Butterhead lettuce]] tossed with a sweetened [[vinaigrette]] dressing, optionally with chopped chives or onions), [[potato salad]], cucumber salad, or parsley potatoes.

To avoid mixing up different products, the Austrian and German food committees have decided that a \"Wiener Schnitzel\" must be made of veal. A Schnitzel made of pork can be called \"Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein\" (''Viennese schnitzel from pork'') or \"Schnitzel Wiener Art\" (''Viennese style schnitzel'').\n\nSimilar dishes to Wiener schnitzel include ''{{lang|de|[[Surschnitzel]]}}'' (from [[curing (food preservation)|cured]] meat), and breaded turkey or chicken steaks.

Accessed on 27 December 2008.</ref> and ''[[Pariser Schnitzel]]''.

It says that nobody is free from Moha. It is bound to be there, but with little patience and understanding we can face it. Do not let this Moha become a permanent guest in your house.\n\nThere used to be very big saint, Guru Vashishtah. He was a brahmgyani. He used to teach Lord Rama by saying that this world is dream, nothing is permanent on this earth only brahm is true.\n\nVashishta had hundred sons. He was very attached to them. Once Vishwamitra, who was very egoistic, killed his hundred sons in anger. Vashistha became very sad and and depressive because he was entangled in the moha of his children. He being a saint could not bear this pain. He became very depressive and wanted to commit suicide. He went and jumped into a river. The river saw such a saint and gyani person has jumped into the river, she threw him out of the river by force. He attempted to jump again, the river just threw him out again. Brahm Rishi Vashishtha felt that he may be too light to drown so he tied himself with a stone to commit suicide by jumping in the river.\n\nThe river knew that he is a big saint and tried to help him. So she turned into a woman and stopped him from doing so. She caught hold of him and brought him near the bank of the river. She asked him why is he committing suicide. Vashishta explained to her that how Vishwamitra killed his hundred sons and because of that he does not want to live. Best is to die. The river said \"You are such a gyani purush, you have given knowledge to Lord Rama about Brahm by saying the world is not real,it is a dream and now you are finding it real, you are blinded by moha of your sons and want to destroy your life. What is the use of this gyan.\nThe river then said that you are highly knowledgeable person, highly regarded and respected by all, were going to commit such a grave sin, such a shameful act. What example would you set for your disciplines and the next generation. You have given spiritual knowledge to your disciples by saying that \"we are not body, we not mind, we are not intellect, we are not thoughts and we are just souls, the children of Almighty. How can you think of such an act\". There was continuous discussions between Rishi Vashishtha and the river who was in form of a woman. Within few minutes Rishi Vashishtha realised his mistake and came back to his original self. He regained knowledge which was covered by the thin curtain of Moha(attachment). Moha got vanished and Vashishtah realised that he is not a body, he is a soul.\nThe bondage of Moha is very strong. We cannot easily eradicate it. Even big Rishia, Munis get affected. We as normal being should not think that being attached is not a gyani bakht's quality. It is with the help of our well wisher we can overcome this Moha. This all happens with the blessings of God who helps us at the time of grief and sorrow and keeps us away from the feeling of depression.\n\nAccording to Agarwal, one mythical legend states that Vashishtha wanted to commit suicide by falling into river [[Sarasvati|Saraswati]]. But the river prevented this sacrilege by splitting into hundreds of shallow channels. This story, states Agarwal, may have very ancient roots, where \"the early man observed the braiding process of the Satluj\" and because such a legend could not have invented without the residents observing an ancient river (in Rajasthan) drying up and its tributaries such as Sutlej reflowing to merge into Indus river.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legends as models of Science|jstor=42930266|date=1990|volume=49|pages=41\u201342|last=Agarwal|first= D.P.|journal= Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute}}{{Subscription required|url= http://www.indianscience.org/essays/t_es_agarw_legends.shtml}}</ref>\n\n===Rivalry with Vishwamitra===\nVashishtha is known for his feud with Vishwamitra. The king Vishwamitra coveted Vashistha's divine cow Nandini that could fulfil material desires. Vashishtha destroyed Vishwamitra's army and sons. Vishwamitra acquired weapons from Lord Shiva and incinerated Vashishtha's hermitage and sons, but Vashistha baffled all of Vishwamitra's weapons. Vishwamitra betook severe penances for thousands of years and became a Brahmarshi. He even reconciled with Vashishtha.\n\n===Disciples===\nVashishtha is best known as the priest and preceptor, teacher of the Ikshvaku kings clan. He was also the preceptor of Manu, the progenitor of Kshatriyas and Ikshvaku's father. Other characters like Nahusha, Rantideva, lord Rama and Bhishma were his disciples.\n\nWhen the Bharata king Samvarta lost his kingdom to the Panchalas, he became the disciple of Vashistha. Under Vashistha's guidance, Samvarta regained his kingdom and became the ruler of the earth.\n\n==The ''Vashishtha Head''==\n\nA copper casting of a human head styled in the manner described for Vashishtha was discovered in 1958 in Delhi. This piece has been dated to around 3700 BCE, plus minus 800 years, in three western universities (ETH Zurich, Stanford and UC) using among other methods carbon-14 dating tests, spectrographic analysis, [[X-ray]] dispersal analysis and [[metallography]].<ref name=\"Bryant2003p164\"/><ref>Harry Hicks and Robert Anderson (1990), [http://www.jies.org/docs/jies_index/Vol18.html Analysis of an Indo-European Vedic Aryan Head \u2013 4500-2500 B.C.], in ''Journal of Indo European studies'', Vol. 18, pp 425\u2013446. Fall 1990.</ref> This piece is called \"Vashishtha head\", because the features, hairstyle, [[tilak]] and other features of the casting resembles the description for Vashishtha in Hindu texts.<ref name=\"Bryant2003p164\">{{cite book|author=Edwin Bryant|title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2jfHlinW4UC&pg=PA164 |year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516947-8|page=164}}</ref>\n\nThe significance of \"Vasishtha head\" is unclear because it was not found at an archaeological site, but in open Delhi market where it was scheduled to be remelted. Further, the head had an inscription of \"Narayana\" suggesting that the item was produced in a much later millennium. The item, states Edwin Bryant, likely was re-cast and produced from an ancient pre-2800 BCE copper item that left significant traces of matter with the observed C-14 dating.<ref name=\"Bryant2003p164\"/>\n\n== Vashishtha Temples==\n[[Image:Vashisht temple.jpg|thumb|250px|Vashishtha Temple, in [[Vashisht (Village)|Vashisht]] village, [[Himachal Pradesh]]]]\n\nThere is an Ashram dedicated to Vashishtha in [[Guwahati]], [[India]].

Vashishtha's Temple is situated in [[Vashisht (Village)|Vashisht]] village, Himachal Pradesh. Vashishtha Cave, a cave on the banks of [[Ganges]] at Shivpuri, 18&nbsp;km from [[Rishikesh]] is also locally believed to be his winter abode and houses a Shiva temple, also nearby is Arundhati Cave.\n\nGuru Vashishtha is also the primary deity at [[Arattupuzha Temple]] known as Arattupuzha Sree Dharmasastha in [[Arattupuzha]] village in [[Thrissur]] district of [[Kerala]].

The king Vishwamitra coveted Vashistha's divine cow Nandini that could fulfil material desires. Vashishtha destroyed Vishwamitra's army and sons. Vishwamitra acquired weapons from Lord Shiva and incinerated Vashishtha's hermitage and sons, but Vashistha baffled all of Vishwamitra's weapons. Vishwamitra betook severe penances for thousands of years and became a Brahmarshi. He even reconciled with Vashishtha.\n\n===Disciples===\nVashishtha is best known as the priest and preceptor, teacher of the Ikshvaku kings clan. He was also the preceptor of Manu, the progenitor of Kshatriyas and Ikshvaku's father. Other characters like Nahusha, Rantideva, lord Rama and Bhishma were his disciples.\n\nWhen the Bharata king Samvarta lost his kingdom to the Panchalas, he became the disciple of Vashistha. Under Vashistha's guidance, Samvarta regained his kingdom and became the ruler of the earth.\n\n==The ''Vashishtha Head''==\n\nA copper casting of a human head styled in the manner described for Vashishtha was discovered in 1958 in Delhi. This piece has been dated to around 3700 BCE, plus minus 800 years, in three western universities (ETH Zurich, Stanford and UC) using among other methods carbon-14 dating tests, spectrographic analysis, [[X-ray]] dispersal analysis and [[metallography]].<ref name=\"Bryant2003p164\"/><ref>Harry Hicks and Robert Anderson (1990), [http://www.jies.org/docs/jies_index/Vol18.html Analysis of an Indo-European Vedic Aryan Head \u2013 4500-2500 B.C.], in ''Journal of Indo European studies'', Vol. 18, pp 425\u2013446.

Further, the head had an inscription of \"Narayana\" suggesting that the item was produced in a much later millennium. The item, states Edwin Bryant, likely was re-cast and produced from an ancient pre-2800 BCE copper item that left significant traces of matter with the observed C-14 dating.<ref name=\"Bryant2003p164\"/>\n\n== Vashishtha Temples==\n[[Image:Vashisht temple.jpg|thumb|250px|Vashishtha Temple, in [[Vashisht (Village)|Vashisht]] village, [[Himachal Pradesh]]]]\n\nThere is an Ashram dedicated to Vashishtha in [[Guwahati]], [[India]].

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the archiepiscopal see of all the Nordic countries, dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the [[Nordic countries]]\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"The giant Finn and his wife\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658 the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes done during the 19th century went very far; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and pieces of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see covering all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The crypt, the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have promted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates on the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars in the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin the be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, e.g. in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe in Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was by and large similar to the one see today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, repairs were continuously made during the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of Zettervall]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the situation in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while also making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately got his will through, for the most part.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862 Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

Behind them a [[nave]] with two [[aisle]] opens up to a [[transept]] that is somewhat higher than the nave. A short flight of stairs thus connect the nave with the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] as well as with the crypt under the choir. The choir ends in an apse. Inside, the bays of the cathedral are supported by [[groin vault]]s. The number of bays in the aisles are the double of that in the nave. The arches that separate the nave from the aisles are supported by piers and pillars of alternating width.

They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}} The choir stalls in Lund Cathedral also lent stylistic inspiration to the choir stalls in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and [[St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted]].{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}}{{sfn|Dun\u00e9r|1984|p=1\u20139}}\n\nSlightly older than the choir stalls is a [[Cathedra|bishop's throne]] which survives in a damaged state and is placed in the south transept. It is somewhat similar in construction to the choir stalls but stylistically different and more closely related to contemporary art from north Germany.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=32\u201335}}\n\n===Astronomical clock===\n{{Main|Horologium mirabile Lundense}}\n[[File:Lunds astronomiska ur-2.jpg|thumb|right|The astronomical clock]]\nThe [[astronomical clock]] of Lund Cathedral, presently located at the west end of the north aisle, dates from the late Middle Ages and was installed in Lund Cathedral {{circa}} 1425. In 1837 it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect {{ill|Theodor W\u00e5hlin|sv}} and the Danish clock-maker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later. Saint Lawrence's column is approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall (and the saint {{convert|70|cm|inch}}), while the columns with angels are slightly smaller.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=114}} The three columns were probably made in [[L\u00fcbeck]] or [[Hamburg]].

The artist was [[Johannes Ganssog]] from [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] in present-day Germany. It is technically skillfully attached to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar.

More systematic surveys of the flora of the building have been published in 1922 and in 1993 (the latter only encompassing lichen).{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} Of the species observed growing on the cathedral, the minute [[fern]] [[Asplenium ruta-muraria|wall-rue]] was mentioned as early as 1756 by {{ill|Anders Tidstr\u00f6m|sv}} and is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the cathedral flora.{{sfn|Gertz|1923|p=458}} When the lichen flora was surveyed in 1993, 15 species were discovered.

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the archiepiscopal see of all the Nordic countries, dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the [[Nordic countries]]\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"The giant Finn and his wife\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658 the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes done during the 19th century went very far; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and pieces of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence ove church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see covering all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The crypt, the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have promted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates on the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars in the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin the be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, e.g. in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe in Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was by and large similar to the one see today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, repairs were continuously made during the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of Zettervall]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the situation in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while also making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately got his will through, for the most part.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862 Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

In 1837 it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect {{ill|Theodor W\u00e5hlin|sv}} and the Danish clock-maker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) began work on NextGen improvements in 2007 and plans to have all major components in place by 2025.<ref>[https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf 2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System] based on the Future of the NAS Report</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe goals of the modernization include using new technologies and procedures to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the [[environmental impact of aviation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe need for NextGen became apparent during the summer of 2000 when air travel was impeded by severe congestion and costly delays. Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract. [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], and [[ITT Inc.|ITT Corp.]] received FAA contracts worth up to $4.4 billion to conduct large-scale demonstrations to see how NextGen concepts, procedures, and technologies could be integrated into the current NAS. In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment. The FAA refined the path that the NextGen planners envisioned with a few adjustments, eliminating some concepts that were high cost, high risk, or of low benefit based on research and industry feedback. The FAA is making progress in transforming the NAS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-24/faa-declares-steady-progress-nextgen-atc-modernization|title=FAA Declares Steady Progress on NextGen ATC Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2017-02-15/faas-nextgen-making-progress-airline-pilots-union-asserts|title=FAA's NextGen Making Progress, Airline Pilots Union Asserts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2017/03/02/faa-ready-review-us-air-traffic-modernization/|title=FAA Ready to Review US Air Traffic Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/23/datacomm-eram-ads-b-huerta-touts-nextgen-milestones/|title=DataComm, ERAM, ADS-B: Huerta Touts NextGen Milestones|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSix concepts that posed too high a technical risk, for instance those with no available technical solution, have been deferred beyond 2030. Some concepts that required more research to garner evidence of perceived operational benefits also have been deferred for implementation into the later segments of NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Elements==\nNextGen is generally described as a shift from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management. It is not one technology, product, or goal; but rather, it encompasses many technologies and procedures that are being developed and implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions. It lowers the chances of delays or cancellations when weather affects the flight route. Pilots and controllers also can spend more time on other critical tasks, which enhances safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20160624/lax-unveils-data-comm-aircraft-texting-system-designed-to-reduce-flight-delays|title=LAX unveils Data Comm aircraft texting system designed to reduce flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kutv.com/news/local/new-data-comm-reduces-wait-time-on-slc-runways|title=New Data Comm system reduces wait time on SLC runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|title=Pilots, air traffic controllers shifting to text messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235508/https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|archive-date=2018-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ohare-pilot-texting-0930-biz-20160929-story.html|title=Pilots to start texting at O'Hare, Midway \u2014 but it's not what you think|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/faa-shows-off-new-air-traffic-communications-at-msp/419214164/|title=\"FAA shows off new air-traffic communications at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-flights-benefiting-from-new-text-based-tech-faa-says-1.13276922|title=NYC flights benefiting from new text-based tech, FAA says|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/pilot-text-messages-are-saving-you-from-flight-delays/|title=Pilot text messages are saving you from flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-09-28/faa-accelerates-data-communications-roll-out-atc-towers|title=FAA Accelerates Data Communications Roll Out to ATC Towers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/27/airlines-flight-controllers-data-communications/91177576/|title=Less chat, more action for airlines, flight controllers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crankyflier.com/2016/06/28/a-demo-on-how-data-comm-is-going-to-make-flying-better/|title=A Demo On How Data Comm Is Going to Make Flying Better|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/new-direct-digital-link-between-tower-and-cockpit-will-speed-planes-on-their-way/2016/09/27/50eb9ec8-843b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html|title=New direct digital link between tower and cockpit will speed planes on their way|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on Data Comm's success, air carriers requested and the FAA approved in 2017 seven more airports to receive tower services to be completed by 2019.

More types of air traffic controller messages will be available, including the ability to reroute multiple aircraft. Initial Data Comm services for high-altitude flight started in November 2019 at the Kansas City and Indianapolis air route traffic control centers and are scheduled to be in place at all 20 centers across the country by 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aviationtoday.com/2019/11/13/delayed-delivery-en-route-cpdlc-messages-fixed-faa-says/|title=Delayed Delivery of En-route CPDLC Messages Fixed, FAA Says|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2019|website=Avionics International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nVoice exchanges will always be part of air traffic control. In critical situations, they continue to be the primary form of controller-pilot interaction. For routine communications between pilots and controllers, Data Comm will increase efficiency and airspace capacity. Data Comm is expected to save operators more than $10 billion over the 30-year life cycle of the program and the FAA about $1 billion in future operating costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Data Communications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313110025/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Navigation ===\n[[Performance-based navigation|Performance Based Navigation]] (PBN) is an [[instrument flight rules]]<nowiki/> way of moving through airspace that varies depending equipage, navigational aids, and pilot training. Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts.

It is operational at 20 en route centers, 28 TRACONs, and 45 airport towers. Its tools, such as extended metering and integrated departure arrival capability, help controllers sequence traffic with time instead of distance. Performance Based Navigation route and procedure data help improve predicted arrival times. TBFM will lengthen its metering capability into terminal airspace with the terminal sequencing and spacing tool developed by NASA and delivered to the FAA in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/aero/nasa-delivers-traffic-spacing-tools-tss/|title=NASA Delivers New Air Traffic Spacing Tool to FAA|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Its first deployment is planned for 2021.

However, the agency leveraged new information management technologies to improve information delivery and content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|title=NextGen Operational Performance Assessment September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429034552/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2007, the FAA established the [[System Wide Information Management|SWIM]] program to implement a set of information technology principles in the National Airspace System (NAS) and provide users with relevant and commonly understandable information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/swim/overview/|title=SWIM program overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305233040/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/swim/overview/|archive-date=2015-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> SWIM facilitates NextGen's data-sharing requirements, serving as the digital data-sharing backbone. This platform offers a single point of access for more than 100 products, categorized into aeronautical, flight and traffic flow, and weather data. Producers can publish data once, and approved consumers can access needed information through a single connection, an improvement over the legacy way of connecting two systems with fixed network connections and custom point-to-point application-level data interfaces. The new format supports collaboration within domestic and international aviation communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/09/evaluating-future-global-swim-implementation/|title=Evaluating Future Global SWIM Implementation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the SWIM program completed its first segment, which established a common infrastructure and connection points at all en route traffic control centers. The program's second segment in 2016 established a service-oriented architecture \u2014 composed of producers, consumers, and a registry \u2014 and connected National Airspace System (NAS) programs, such as the Traffic Flow Management System, to provide large data sources for consumers. Several enhancements are being added, including improved security, and SWIM continues to add NAS air traffic management content providers and consumers.\n\nAs of October 2017, 10 NAS programs and six external organizations produce data sent via the SWIM network. A total of 180 consumers can access the data, with another 100 potential consumers in various stages of becoming SWIM consumers. A cloud distribution system established in 2019 is expected to help further increase the number of users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://connectedaviationtoday.com/connecting-system-wide-information-management-cloud/#.Xfzf_fk3ncs|title=Connecting System Wide Information Management (SWIM) to the Cloud|last=|first=|date=February 21, 2019|work=Connected Aviation Today|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The revised setup of SWIM reduces costs, can increase operational efficiency, and opens the possibility of creating new services for the aviation community.

The most extensive use of SWIM data was supporting improved awareness of operating conditions and flight status, especially on the airport surface and in situations when aircraft transition from the control of one air traffic control center to another. The most dynamic use of real-time surveillance data outside the FAA may be providing flight-tracking services to the flying public and aviation businesses. Through web browsers and mobile apps, service subscribers can access current information about flight and airport status and delays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|title=NextGen Operational Performance Assessment September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429034552/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communication System  ====\nTransmission of information necessary to conduct efficient airport surface operations in the years ahead will be possible with the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communication System (AeroMACS).

The NWP program will establish a common weather processing platform to replace the legacy FAA weather processor systems and supply new capabilities. The fully automated NWP will identify safety hazards around airports and in cruising altitude airspace. It will support strategic traffic flow management, including the translated weather information needed to predict route blockage and airspace capacity constraints up to eight hours in advance. NWP will use advanced algorithms to create current and predicted aviation-specific weather information with data from the FAA and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)<nowiki/> radar and sensors, and NOAA forecast models. Part of the NWP, the Aviation Weather Display consolidates the current Weather and Radar Processor, Integrated Terminal Weather System, and the Corridor Integrated Weather System displays. The Aviation Weather Display will provide consistent weather information at a glance for en route and terminal controllers, and includes NWP and NOAA weather products.\n\nCSS-Wx will be the single producer of weather data, products, and imagery within the NAS, using standards-based weather dissemination via SWIM. It will consolidate and enable the decommissioning of legacy weather dissemination systems. It also offers NWP and NOAA weather products, and other weather sources for integration into air traffic decision support systems, improving the quality of traffic management decisions and enhancing controller productivity during severe weather. CSS-Wx information consumers will include air traffic controllers and managers, commercial and general aviation operators, and the flying public.\n\nThe FAA's Weather Technology in the Cockpit team of researchers are experts on the pitfalls of how weather is displayed in [[general aviation]] cockpits. Their main research goal is to encourage improvements in how meteorological information is shown in the cockpit so pilots can consistently and accurately interpret that information, understand its limitations and use it effectively to avoid bad weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbaa.org/events/bace/2016/newsroom/news/20161102-faa-teams-working-to-improve-quality-of-available-weather-information-to-pilots.php\\|title=FAA Teams Working to Improve Quality of Available Weather Information to Pilots|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120070347/https://www.nbaa.org/events/bace/2016/newsroom/news/20161102-faa-teams-working-to-improve-quality-of-available-weather-information-to-pilots.php|archive-date=2018-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/93Annual/webprogram/Paper220086.html|title=The FAA's Weather Technology in the Cockpit Program - An Overview and Discussion of Challenges Ahead|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple Runway Operations and Separation Management ===\nEfficiency of multiple runway operations (MRO), particularly those that are closely spaced, has been limited by safety risks, including collisions and [[wake turbulence]]<nowiki/> with nearby aircraft.

Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions.

NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

Nextgen has created a \"rail\" of flights, or a concentrated path of flights, in cities across the United States, and residents living under the \"rail\" are hearing more aircraft noise. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|title=NextGen Nextgen and Noise Pollution the FAAs Carte Blanche to Send Planes Screaming Over Our Houses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818142440/https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|archive-date=2019-08-18|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> Congress set up a coalition to study the noise issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|title=National Quiet Skies Coalition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818145007/https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|archive-date=2019-08-18|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> A [[Government Accountability Office]] report on environmental impacts at airports indicated that the changes in flight paths that will accompany NextGen efforts would affect some communities that were previously unaffected or minimally affected by aircraft noise and expose them to increased noise levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-50|title=Aviation and the Environment: Systematically Addressing Environmental Impacts and Community Concerns Can Help Airports Reduce Project Delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> These levels could trigger the need for environmental reviews, as well as raise community concerns. The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

Dixon, principal assistant inspector general for auditing and evaluation, the FAA's major acquisitions since the creation of the [[Air Traffic Organization]] continue to experience performance issues. Six programs experienced cost increases totaling $692 million and schedule delays averaging 25 months. The FAA's implementation of this approach has led to unclear and inconsistent reporting on overall program costs, schedules, and benefits. Notwithstanding reforms, several underlying and systemic issues \u2014 including overambitious plans, shifting requirements, software development problems, ineffective contract and program management, and unreliable cost and schedule estimates \u2014 affect the FAA's ability to introduce new technologies and capabilities that are critical to transitioning to NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/news/show/1014429.html/|title=Inspector General Report Shows FAA Is Failing and Why a Non-Profit Should Manage Air Traffic Control|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/32908|title=FAA Reforms Have Not Achieved Expected Cost, Efficiency, and Modernization Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a meeting with air carrier CEOs shortly after taking office, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] claimed that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] spent more than $7 billion to upgrade the system and \u201ctotally failed.\u201d However, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a speech that NextGen has already provided $2.7 billion in benefits, and is on track to provide more than $157 billion more by 2030.

The National Research Council's 2015 \u201cReview of the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d report explains that NextGen needs an explicit system architecture \u2014 in addition to its existing enterprise architecture  \u2014 to guide its development, manage risk, and cope with change. To create this architecture, FAA should build an architecture community and also strengthen its work force in several technical fields. The report also examines the incorporation of cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and human factors into the NextGen architecture. Finally, the report considers NextGen's anticipated costs and benefits, noting that airlines are not motivated to spend money on NextGen because they receive few direct benefits and face schedule uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21721|title=FAA Should 'Reset Expectations' for Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise ===\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jdasolutions.aero/blog/nextgen-noise-study/|title=NextGen Noise: RNP\u2019s concentrated IMPACT may justify substantive change in FAA policies under a proper study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|title=FAA facing backlash over noise issues created by PBN flight paths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021124915/http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/advances-in-airport-technology-mean-sleepless-nights-for-some/2016/03/04/7b8eb936-e098-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html|title=Advances in airport technology mean sleepless nights for some|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aireform.com/a-closer-look-at-how-faa-is-tone-deaf-on-nextgen-noise-impacts/|title=A Closer Look at How FAA is \u2018Tone-Deaf\u2019 on NextGen Noise Impacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectparkquietskies.org/Maurice_Implications_Enviro_NextGen.pdf|title=Implications of Administration Environmental Requirements for NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes.

Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract.

In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|title=FAA Modernization and Reform Act (P.L. 112-095) Reports and Plans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811143229/http://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|archive-date=2014-08-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> included establishing deadlines for adopting existing NextGen navigation and surveillance technology and mandated development of precision navigational procedures at the nation's 35 busiest airports by 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the FAA's Aviation Safety organization released a work plan that identified how the safety staff would set NextGen standards and oversee safe implementation of new technologies, processes, and procedures. The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

It is not one technology, product, or goal; but rather, it encompasses many technologies and procedures that are being developed and implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions.

Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure. A new route structure makes straighter paths possible for greater efficiency, and more routes can fit into the same airspace, which increases capacity. From 2009\u20132016, PBN procedures available nearly tripled at airports across the nation. As of December 2019, the FAA has published more than 9,600 PBN procedures and routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/procedures/ifp_inventory_summary/|title=Instrument Flight Procedures (IFP) Inventory Summary|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2019|website=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These consist of RNAV [[standard instrument departure]]s, T-Routes (1,200 feet above the surface to 18,000 feet of altitude), Q-Routes (18,000\u201345,000 feet of altitude), RNAV [[Standard terminal arrival route|standard terminal arrivals]] (STAR), RNAV (GPS) approaches, and RNP approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the airports that publish [[instrument approach]] procedures, 96 percent publish PBN approach procedures and 31 percent use only PBN approach procedures.\n\nRNAV STAR procedures can provide a [[continuous descent approach]] also known as an optimized profile descent from cruising altitude to save fuel and reduce emissions and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/houston-nextgen-plane-descents/|title=Planes Are Finally Making Logical Descents Onto American Runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA has published many RNAV STAR procedures with this capability that enable aircraft to fly closer to the airport at a more fuel-efficient altitude before descending, which also saves fuel by eliminating level-offs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|title=New Analysis Shows Big Benefits at Minneapolis International Airport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094052/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|title=Changes to Houston\u2019s Airspace Bring Millions in Benefits to Local Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201103647/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> These procedures can be flown when available and when pilots are able to use them.\n\nUsing the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]]<nowiki/>, instrument-rated pilots now can land at airports where that was previously impossible using just [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]<nowiki/>.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts. Integration of ADS-B into en route and terminal automation platforms was completed in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=94678|title=FAA Successfully Completes Final ADS-B Milestone|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2019|work=FAA News and Updates|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is evaluating space-based ADS-B surveillance services for oceanic airspace as part of a project called Advanced Surveillance Enhanced Procedural Separation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/faa-takes-steps-toward-space-based-ads-b-track-aircraft|title=FAA Takes Steps Toward Space-Based ADS-B To Track Aircraft|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2019|work=Aviation Week|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Moving from the current system of ADS-B ground stations to radios hosted on satellites offers the potential for reduced separation standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2017/04/27/faa-aireon-announce-space-based-ads-b-flight-test-success/|title=FAA and Aireon Announce Space-Based ADS-B Flight Test Success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-05-15/faa-nav-canada-and-aireon-test-space-based-ads-b|title=FAA, Nav Canada and Aireon Test Space-based ADS-B|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getconnected.aero/2017/04/faa-aireon-next-gen-ads-b/|title=FAA and Aireon announce next-gen ADS-B test success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Even with the capabilities offered by ADS-B through satellite technology, surveillance radar is still relevant and will be used as a supplement and ultimately as backup to ADS-B in the event of service disruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|title=Global Advance Of ADS-B|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926145530/http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==== ADS-B Out ====\nWith ADS-B Out, surveillance coverage increases because ground stations can be provided in locations where obstructions or physical limitations don't allow radar.

They help to achieve NextGen goals of safely increasing access, efficiency, and throughput at many airports when low visibility is the limiting factor. [[Head-up display]]s (HUD) <nowiki/>were approved to use on a precision approach to lower minimum decision heights to land. Use of a qualified HUD when flying to a suitable [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<nowiki/> facility will reduce the required runway visual range visibility for approach.\n\nThe FAA allows the use of an [[enhanced flight vision system]] (EFVS)<nowiki/> instead of natural vision to conduct an instrument landing procedure in low-visibility conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|title=New FAA Rules Let Technology Replace Natural Vision|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111151324/http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|archive-date=2017-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FAA-Expands-Enhanced-Vision-Capabilities-228201-1.html|title=FAA Expands Enhanced Vision Capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> EFVS uses sensor technologies to provide a clear, real-time virtual image to the pilot of the view outside the aircraft, regardless of the cloud cover and visibility conditions. Pilots can identify required visual references that would be impossible without it. It provides access that otherwise would be denied because of low visibility. A [[Synthetic vision system|synthetic vision guidance system]]<nowiki/> combines flight guidance display technology with high-precision position assurance monitors to provide a continuous and correct depiction of the external scene and runway. It can assist a pilot's transition to natural vision references. A project also is under way to enable taxiing at airports in low-visibility conditions.\n\nAnother NextGen project is the Ground Based Augmentation System Landing System (GBAS). It uses GPS to support all precision-approach categories. Newark and Houston operate non-federal GBAS systems approved for operations to as low as 200 feet above the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/delivering/oiaa/investments/|title=NextGen Operator Investments|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502100203/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/delivering/oiaa/investments/|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter a reduction of minimum visual runway range requirements, an FAA assessment showed airport access during low-visibility conditions improved in two ways: almost 6 percent fewer periods of time with no access and 17 percent more flights could land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|title=NextGen Operational Performance Assessment September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429034552/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInitial tailored arrivals are available for certain aircraft flying into San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Miami. These arrivals are planned, fixed routes for aircraft approaching these airports from oceanic airspace that are communicated via a data link from the air traffic controller. They limit vectoring and minimize the time the aircraft spends maintaining level flight during descent, which reduces fuel consumption, aircraft exhaust emissions, and time in flight. These differ from Performance Based Navigation's optimized profile descents because they are tailored to the characteristics of a limited number of aircraft types equipped with the [[Future Air Navigation System]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf|title=2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System based on the Future of the NAS Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804121920/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cms.dot.gov/content/benefits-next-generation-air-transportation-system|title=The Benefits of the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2005/05/01/tailored-arrivals-idling-down-to-the-final-approach/|title=Tailored Arrivals: Idling Down to the Final Approach|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Airport Mapping ===\nThe FAA Office of Airports [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) <nowiki/>program provides data to manage aeronautical information and NextGen implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0315/esri-solution-helps-airports-meet-new-faa-rules|title=Esri Solution Helps Airports Meet New FAA Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> GIS identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features or boundaries on the earth's surface.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016. The FAA will use those results and other research under way to re-evaluate criteria to define significance under the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]<nowiki/> and federal land use guidelines. In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]] noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2017-05-17_-_full_committee_ssm.pdf|title=Committee Hearing on \"The Need to Reform FAA and Air Traffic Control to Build a 21st Century Aviation System for America\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400893|title=Latest Inspector General Report Underscores Need for Air Traffic Control Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of NextGen has led to a renewed push to reform air traffic control, supported by the Trump Administration, that would move this function from the government to a not-for-profit, independent entity managed by a professional board of directors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/05/president-donald-j-trumps-principles-reforming-us-air-traffic-control|title=President Donald J.
