Total cost of the project is \u20ac105.0 million with the GOJ contributing \u20ac25 million for land acquisition and re-settlement as well as the construction of three bridges along the segment.\n\nThe entire project consists of approximately {{cvt|287|km}} of roadway and is divided into three segments. of the jittery jorny\n\u00b7 Segment 1 \u2013 Negril to Montego Bay (approx. {{cvt|71|km|disp=sqbr}})\n\u00b7 Segment 2 \u2013 Montego Bay to Ocho Rios (approx. {{cvt|97|km|disp=sqbr}})\n\u00b7 Segment 3 \u2013 Ocho Rios to Fair Prospect (approx. {{cvt|119|km|disp=sqbr}})\n<ref>[http://www.mhtww.gov.jm/NewsPage/2005/Contracts%20Signed%20for%20Segment%20Three%20of%20North%20Coast%20Highway.aspx]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref> findered road\n\n==Southern Coastal Highway==\n\nApproval has been given by Cabinet for the execution of a contract between the government and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. for the design, improvement and construction of Sections 1A and 1B of the Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project.  This will involve work from Harbour View to Morant Bay as part of the overall Segment from Harbour View to Port Antonio.\n\nThe existing main road along this southern coastal section of the island has been in generally poor condition. The alignment, surface condition, drainage are in need of major improvement.\n\nThe Harbour View to Morant Bay section covers some {{cvt|43|km}}, with Morant Bay to Port Antonio approximately {{cvt|65|km}}. The work on the Harbour View to Morant Bay leg is estimated to cost approximately US$385 million.\n\nAmong the improvement works will be a re alignment of the White Horses Bypass to the south of the town along the sea coast rather than to the north and modification of the Morant Bay Bypass at the western and eastern ends.\n\nA section of the highway will also be constructed to accommodate four lanes and major structures are to be built including 16 bridges, one flyover, and one subway, along with new pipe and box culverts.\n\nFinancing for the project is through the China Exim Bank.
