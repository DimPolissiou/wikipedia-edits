It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Link 16===\n{{main|Link 16}}\nOn 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network.

It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Link 16===\n{{main|Link 16}}\nOn 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network.

Although 24 Rafales, divided into two squadrons, are expected to be embarked usually some aircraft remain in France for upgrade or training. US Navy F-18 Hornets and C-2 Greyhounds conduct regularly qualification traps and launches from CdG.

The concert was the longest ever performed by the group, consisting of 48 songs (including guest appearances by ex.members Rio Michibayashi, Rina Yokoyama and Yukiko Nakayama). Nearly every song released by the group was performed, and the setlist was composed so that newer songs were performed first and older songs were performed last. At the end of the concert, the future paths of each of the members were announced: First Summer Uika and Nozomi Hirano would form [[Billie Idle]]; Saki Kamiya would form Pla2me with Mari Mizuta; Megumi Koshouji would form Maison Book Girl; Tentenko would start a solo/DJ career; Pour Lui would continue to perform with Lui Frontic Matsukuma Japan. In addition, in classic Bis style, a concert by \"Ex. Bis\" was announced for the next day at the Shimokitazawa Shelter. Tickets were exclusively 30,000 yen, including an \"all you can eat buffet\" (revealed on the day to be McDonald's). This July 9 show marked the true end of Bis.\n\n====Post disbandment====\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Junnosuke Watanabe, along with members of the team that initially conceived Bis would be putting together a successor group [[BiSH|Bish]].

The album consists mostly of re-recorded Bis hit songs, but includes five new tracks as well.\n\n==== 2017: New members, the Diet or Die controversy, major debut ====\nThe reformed Bis, named in official materials as the \"Brand-new BiS\", released their second album, [[Re:STUPiD|Re:Stupid]] in February.\n\nIt was announced at the same time that an audition would be held for all groups managed by [[WACK (music company)|WACK]] (Watanabe Artistic Creative Kabushikigaisha, a management company formed by Watanabe Junnosuke after the disband of Bis to manage Kamiya Saki's group pla2me), and Pour Lui and Aya Eightprince joined the audition bootcamp as representatives of Bis. The three-day audition concluded with a performance from each group involved, and the results were announced - Pan Luna Leafy and Momoland were added to Bis, while two other successful applicants were selected for a collaborative project between WACK and major label [[Avex Trax]], known as Project aW. It was also announced that Aya Eightprince and former Bis member Kamiya Saki would trade places, with Aya moving to [[Gang Parade]] and Saki returning to Bis. This lineup of Bis released the single \"Socialism\" at the end of May.\n\nAt the same time, leader Pour Lui began to appear in a series of videos on the Bis YouTube channel named \"Diet or Die\", a documentary series showing Pour Lui attending the popular personal fitness gym Rizap in order to lose weight. The first episode of the series states that if she fails to meet a target weight, she will have to pay for the cost of the course herself. However, later in the series, Pour Lui gains rebound weight, and is instructed to lose it under threat of being suspended from Bis. When she is unable to do so, Watanabe announces his decision to suspend Lui from all Bis activities, including an upcoming one-man concert at Akasaka Blitz. The video then appears to show Pour Lui hiding her face, tearfully apologising to fans.\n\nThe now-deleted video generated an outrage from fans and non-fans alike, accruing several thousand dislikes in the space of a week and earning coverage on news sites including [[HuffPost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/09/20/bis-pour-lui_a_23217324/|title=\u300c\u30d6\u30bf\u300d\u3068\u7f75\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u5931\u6557\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u4f11\u6b62\u306b\u3000\u6442\u98df\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u300c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u300d\u3068\u6307\u6458  #ladiesbeopen|date=2017-09-21|work=HuffPost Japan|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ja-JP}}</ref> In response to the backlash, Pour Lui and Watanabe recorded a song titled \"Best Friend\" together, in which they apologise to fans for taking advantage of them, and thanking HuffPost for spreading the group's name. However, Pour Lui was still under suspension, and did not appear with Bis until October 6, at their \"Idol is Dead\" concert. The concert began with a 6-member Bis performing together, but during five consecutive performances of the song \"Paprika\", Kamiya Saki called out for Pour Lui to join them on stage.\n\nAt the end of the \"IDOL is DEAD\" show, it was announced that Bis would make their second major-label debut, this time from [[Nippon Crown]] subsidiary Crown Stones.\n\n====2018: Second major debut, more major changes====\n\nJanuary 6, 2018: Leader and founding member Pour Lui announced her intention to graduate at the final date of the group's 2nd \"Beginning Tour\" at Heavy Sick Zero because since Bis got a major-label deal recently, that the group doesn\u2019t need her and she no longer needed them either. Her last show was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena on March 4, 2018.\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Aya Eightprince returned from her rental period in Gang Parade, rejoining the group for their debut single from Crown Stones, \"Whole Lotta Love / Dipromise\", released March 7, 2018. Kamiya Saki's last performance with Bis before being returned to Gang Parade was held on the 3rd of March, however, the end of the trade period was not made official until the ending ceremony at the March 4th Ryogoku Kokugikan show. \"Whole Lotta Love\" became the first Bis song not to feature any original members, while \"Dipromise\" is the last Bis recording to feature Pour Lui and Kamiya Saki.\n\nIn the middle of March, an audition was held to find new members for Bis, Bish, Gang Parade, and the newly debuted [[Empire (group)|Empire]]. This resulted in a major overhaul to the way Bis operates: the group would be split into two teams, named Bis 1st and Bis 2nd. Bis 1st featured current members Go Zeela and Pan Luna Leafy, plus new members Nel Nehru (formerly Orangeko Vampire) and Toriaez Hana (formerly Cent Chihiro Tette). Bis 2nd featured Kika Front Frontale, Peri Ubu, Aya Eightprince, with new members Mewclub (formerly Choushouji Megumi) and Muropanako (formerly Ayuna C). Yuina Empire, a member of Empire, was given a permanent transfer to Bis 2nd. The lineup did not take effect until a new tour in June. A new single, \"Don't miss it!!\", was announced for release on July 4, in three versions: Bis 1st released two limited-edition versions of the single, featuring bonus footage of the \"Who Killed Idol?\" show at Ryogoku Kokugikan, while Bis 2nd released a CD-only version.\n\nMomoland was originally intended to debut as part of Bis 1st, along with a new member using the temporary stage name Gamiya Saki, but due to both members choosing to leave Bis before the release of \"Don't Miss It!!\", Bis 1st consisted of four members. This system was referred to as \"Bis.League\", and the top four members voted for by fans were to make up future iterations of Bis 1st.\n\nOn April 18, Momoland did not appear at Bis' scheduled show, sending a message to the other members that read \"I can't go today.\" She did not respond to contact and the show was held with five members. On April 20, it was announced that Momoland would leave Bis, due to physical and mental exhaustion. The rest of Bis' \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\" was held with five members until the new members debuted in June.\n\nIn November 2018, Bis released \"Against the Pain\", their second single under the Bis.League system. Bis 1st (Go Zeela, Toriaez Hana, Aya Eightprince, and Pan Lunaleafy) released it in the form of a collector's box edition limited to 1,000 copies, while Bis 2nd released it as a single CD. \"Against the Pain\" also contained voting tickets for the Bis.League system, and voting continued until December 24.\n\n====2019: Abolishment of Bis.League, ''Are You Ready?'', second disbandment====\n\nAfter the voting period for \"Against the Pain\" had ended, the results were announced at the final date of the \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\": Bis 1st was to consist of Go Zeela, Aya Eightprince, Kika Front Frontale and Peri Ubu, while Pan Lunaleafy, Mewclub, Nel Nehru, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, and Toriaez Hana were placed in Bis 2nd. However, manager Watanabe announced that the Bis.League system would be abolished for the next single, and all 10 members were to perform on it. Despite this, five members were [[designated for assignment]]: Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, Toriaez Hana, and Nel Nehru. The future of these members in Bis was to be decided by the sales figures of the new Bis single, \"Are You Ready?\", released in March. It was announced that \"Are You Ready?\" was to be used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] show [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]] from April onwards.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Nel Nehru announced her immediate departure from Bis, bringing the number of members DFA to four. The nine-member Bis went on to promote \"Are You Ready?\" with a 69-hour release event consisting of song performances, fan interaction and merchandise sales, and sleeping on stage. The single charted at 2nd place, the highest position for a Bis single to date, but the four members designated for assignment were still sent to participate in a week-long WACK audition bootcamp.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Toriaez Hana, Muropanako, Mayu Empire (of Empire) and Ayuni D (of Bish), were each assigned to lead a team of new audition candidates. On day four of the camp, it was announced that any Bis member to be eliminated from the auditions would also lose her place in Bis. On day four, Aya Eightprince was eliminated. On the morning of day six, Toriaez Hana lost a sit-up challenge to avoid elimination and was subsequently eliminated.\n\nThe results of the audition were publicly announced on the 30th of March at the free WACK Exhibition event , where Bis performed with the eliminated members. They announced that the 9 members of the group unanimously agreed to disband Bis for the second time rather than continue with members missing. The final concert of Bis' 2nd generation was held on the 11th of May, the final date of their \"Are you ready to go?\" tour.\n\n===Third generation===\n====2019: Second reformation====\nAuditions were

A 2014 photoshoot in ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' saw them fully nude and covered in fake semen. In December 2013, they posed nude for the magazine ''Quick Japan.''\n\nTheir debut was rather down to earth musically, though since their switch to a major label they have explored genres such as [[digital hardcore]], [[noise music]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BiS-Kaidan: Idol-Killers Somehow Unite J-Pop, Harsh Noise, and Buckets of Slime|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/artpop-bis-kaidan-j-pop-idol-brand-new-idol-society-noise/|work=SPIN}}</ref> and [[ska punk]]. The majority of Bis songs have lyrics written by the members themselves,\n\nAfter the group reformed, their image became less confrontational, albeit while retaining a darker, \"alternative\" theme. Moshing, stage diving and lifting were banned at their concerts, previously known for a rowdy and violent atmosphere. Bis manager Watanabe Junnosuke has explained that during the initial run of Bis, certain concert venues refused to book the group, and companies were unwilling to use them or their music for promotional purposes, making it difficult for the group to create a profit.\n\nIn 2019, the new Bis received their first major commercial tie-in with the anime [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]], which will use their single \"Are you ready?\" as its fifth ending theme song. The song, which exceeds 11 minutes in length and includes explicit references to [[irrumatio]] in the lyrics, incorporates elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise]], reminiscent of their earlier collaboratory efforts with [[Hijokaidan]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The concert was the longest ever performed by the group, consisting of 48 songs (including guest appearances by ex.members Rio Michibayashi, Rina Yokoyama and Yukiko Nakayama). Nearly every song released by the group was performed, and the setlist was composed so that newer songs were performed first and older songs were performed last. At the end of the concert, the future paths of each of the members were announced: First Summer Uika and Nozomi Hirano would form [[Billie Idle]]; Saki Kamiya would form Pla2me with Mari Mizuta; Megumi Koshouji would form Maison Book Girl; Tentenko would start a solo/DJ career; Pour Lui would continue to perform with Lui Frontic Matsukuma Japan. In addition, in classic Bis style, a concert by \"Ex. Bis\" was announced for the next day at the Shimokitazawa Shelter. Tickets were exclusively 30,000 yen, including an \"all you can eat buffet\" (revealed on the day to be McDonald's). This July 9 show marked the true end of Bis.\n\n====Post disbandment====\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Junnosuke Watanabe, along with members of the team that initially conceived Bis would be putting together a successor group [[BiSH|Bish]].

The album consists mostly of re-recorded Bis hit songs, but includes five new tracks as well.\n\n==== 2017: New members, the Diet or Die controversy, major debut ====\nThe reformed Bis, named in official materials as the \"Brand-new BiS\", released their second album, [[Re:STUPiD|Re:Stupid]] in February.\n\nIt was announced at the same time that an audition would be held for all groups managed by [[WACK (music company)|WACK]] (Watanabe Artistic Creative Kabushikigaisha, a management company formed by Watanabe Junnosuke after the disband of Bis to manage Kamiya Saki's group pla2me), and Pour Lui and Aya Eightprince joined the audition bootcamp as representatives of Bis. The three-day audition concluded with a performance from each group involved, and the results were announced - Pan Luna Leafy and Momoland were added to Bis, while two other successful applicants were selected for a collaborative project between WACK and major label [[Avex Trax]], known as Project aW. It was also announced that Aya Eightprince and former Bis member Kamiya Saki would trade places, with Aya moving to [[Gang Parade]] and Saki returning to Bis. This lineup of Bis released the single \"Socialism\" at the end of May.\n\nAt the same time, leader Pour Lui began to appear in a series of videos on the Bis YouTube channel named \"Diet or Die\", a documentary series showing Pour Lui attending the popular personal fitness gym Rizap in order to lose weight. The first episode of the series states that if she fails to meet a target weight, she will have to pay for the cost of the course herself. However, later in the series, Pour Lui gains rebound weight, and is instructed to lose it under threat of being suspended from Bis. When she is unable to do so, Watanabe announces his decision to suspend Lui from all Bis activities, including an upcoming one-man concert at Akasaka Blitz. The video then appears to show Pour Lui hiding her face, tearfully apologising to fans.\n\nThe now-deleted video generated an outrage from fans and non-fans alike, accruing several thousand dislikes in the space of a week and earning coverage on news sites including [[HuffPost]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2017/09/20/bis-pour-lui_a_23217324/|title=\u300c\u30d6\u30bf\u300d\u3068\u7f75\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u5931\u6557\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u4f11\u6b62\u306b\u3000\u6442\u98df\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u300c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u300d\u3068\u6307\u6458  #ladiesbeopen|date=2017-09-21|work=HuffPost Japan|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ja-JP}}</ref> In response to the backlash, Pour Lui and Watanabe recorded a song titled \"Best Friend\" together, in which they apologise to fans for taking advantage of them, and thanking HuffPost for spreading the group's name. However, Pour Lui was still under suspension, and did not appear with Bis until October 6, at their \"Idol is Dead\" concert. The concert began with a 6-member Bis performing together, but during five consecutive performances of the song \"Paprika\", Kamiya Saki called out for Pour Lui to join them on stage.\n\nAt the end of the \"IDOL is DEAD\" show, it was announced that Bis would make their second major-label debut, this time from [[Nippon Crown]] subsidiary Crown Stones.\n\n====2018: Second major debut, more major changes====\n\nJanuary 6, 2018: Leader and founding member Pour Lui announced her intention to graduate at the final date of the group's 2nd \"Beginning Tour\" at Heavy Sick Zero because since Bis got a major-label deal recently, that the group doesn\u2019t need her and she no longer needed them either. Her last show was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena on March 4, 2018.\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Aya Eightprince returned from her rental period in Gang Parade, rejoining the group for their debut single from Crown Stones, \"Whole Lotta Love / Dipromise\", released March 7, 2018. Kamiya Saki's last performance with Bis before being returned to Gang Parade was held on the 3rd of March, however, the end of the trade period was not made official until the ending ceremony at the March 4th Ryogoku Kokugikan show. \"Whole Lotta Love\" became the first Bis song not to feature any original members, while \"Dipromise\" is the last Bis recording to feature Pour Lui and Kamiya Saki.\n\nIn the middle of March, an audition was held to find new members for Bis, Bish, Gang Parade, and the newly debuted [[Empire (group)|Empire]]. This resulted in a major overhaul to the way Bis operates: the group would be split into two teams, named Bis 1st and Bis 2nd. Bis 1st featured current members Go Zeela and Pan Luna Leafy, plus new members Nel Nehru (formerly Orangeko Vampire) and Toriaez Hana (formerly Cent Chihiro Tette). Bis 2nd featured Kika Front Frontale, Peri Ubu, Aya Eightprince, with new members Mewclub (formerly Choushouji Megumi) and Muropanako (formerly Ayuna C). Yuina Empire, a member of Empire, was given a permanent transfer to Bis 2nd. The lineup did not take effect until a new tour in June. A new single, \"Don't miss it!!\", was announced for release on July 4, in three versions: Bis 1st released two limited-edition versions of the single, featuring bonus footage of the \"Who Killed Idol?\" show at Ryogoku Kokugikan, while Bis 2nd released a CD-only version.\n\nMomoland was originally intended to debut as part of Bis 1st, along with a new member using the temporary stage name Gamiya Saki, but due to both members choosing to leave Bis before the release of \"Don't Miss It!!\", Bis 1st consisted of four members. This system was referred to as \"Bis.League\", and the top four members voted for by fans were to make up future iterations of Bis 1st.\n\nOn April 18, Momoland did not appear at Bis' scheduled show, sending a message to the other members that read \"I can't go today.\" She did not respond to contact and the show was held with five members. On April 20, it was announced that Momoland would leave Bis, due to physical and mental exhaustion. The rest of Bis' \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\" was held with five members until the new members debuted in June.\n\nIn November 2018, Bis released \"Against the Pain\", their second single under the Bis.League system. Bis 1st (Go Zeela, Toriaez Hana, Aya Eightprince, and Pan Lunaleafy) released it in the form of a collector's box edition limited to 1,000 copies, while Bis 2nd released it as a single CD. \"Against the Pain\" also contained voting tickets for the Bis.League system, and voting continued until December 24.\n\n====2019: Abolishment of Bis.League, ''Are You Ready?'', second disbandment====\n\nAfter the voting period for \"Against the Pain\" had ended, the results were announced at the final date of the \"I Don't Know What Will Happen Tour\": Bis 1st was to consist of Go Zeela, Aya Eightprince, Kika Front Frontale and Peri Ubu, while Pan Lunaleafy, Mewclub, Nel Nehru, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, and Toriaez Hana were placed in Bis 2nd. However, manager Watanabe announced that the Bis.League system would be abolished for the next single, and all 10 members were to perform on it. Despite this, five members were [[designated for assignment]]: Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Muropanako, Toriaez Hana, and Nel Nehru. The future of these members in Bis was to be decided by the sales figures of the new Bis single, \"Are You Ready?\", released in March. It was announced that \"Are You Ready?\" was to be used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] show [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]] from April onwards.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, Nel Nehru announced her immediate departure from Bis, bringing the number of members DFA to four. The nine-member Bis went on to promote \"Are You Ready?\" with a 69-hour release event consisting of song performances, fan interaction and merchandise sales, and sleeping on stage. The single charted at 2nd place, the highest position for a Bis single to date, but the four members designated for assignment were still sent to participate in a week-long WACK audition bootcamp.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, Aya Eightprince, Yuina Empire, Toriaez Hana, Muropanako, Mayu Empire (of Empire) and Ayuni D (of Bish), were each assigned to lead a team of new audition candidates. On day four of the camp, it was announced that any Bis member to be eliminated from the auditions would also lose her place in Bis. On day four, Aya Eightprince was eliminated. On the morning of day six, Toriaez Hana lost a sit-up challenge to avoid elimination and was subsequently eliminated.\n\nThe results of the audition were publicly announced on the 30th of March at the free WACK Exhibition event , where Bis performed with the eliminated members. They announced that the 9 members of the group unanimously agreed to disband Bis for the second time rather than continue with members missing. The final concert of Bis' 2nd generation was held on the 11th of May, the final date of their \"Are you ready to go?\" tour.\n\n===Third generation===\n====2019: Second reformation====\nAuditions were

Pour Lui notes that many are difficult to watch, and Avex staff member Ryuta Ochi explains \"They [Bis] wanted to make a deliberate uglification of idol events.\"<ref name=\"cbw\">{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Clive|date=September 2013|title=Trash Yr Idols|journal=The Wire|issue=355|page=12}}</ref> The image of a typical idol is generally accepted as being pure and good-natured, which Bis reject. A 2014 photoshoot in ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' saw them fully nude and covered in fake semen. In December 2013, they posed nude for the magazine ''Quick Japan.''\n\nTheir debut was rather down to earth musically, though since their switch to a major label they have explored genres such as [[digital hardcore]], [[noise music]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BiS-Kaidan: Idol-Killers Somehow Unite J-Pop, Harsh Noise, and Buckets of Slime|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/11/artpop-bis-kaidan-j-pop-idol-brand-new-idol-society-noise/|work=SPIN}}</ref> and [[ska punk]]. The majority of Bis songs have lyrics written by the members themselves,\n\nAfter the group reformed, their image became less confrontational, albeit while retaining a darker, \"alternative\" theme. Moshing, stage diving and lifting were banned at their concerts, previously known for a rowdy and violent atmosphere. Bis manager Watanabe Junnosuke has explained that during the initial run of Bis, certain concert venues refused to book the group, and companies were unwilling to use them or their music for promotional purposes, making it difficult for the group to create a profit.\n\nIn 2019, the new Bis received their first major commercial tie-in with the anime [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]], which will use their single \"Are you ready?\" as its fifth ending theme song. The song, which exceeds 11 minutes in length and includes explicit references to [[irrumatio]] in the lyrics, incorporates elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise]], reminiscent of their earlier collaboratory efforts with [[Hijokaidan]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within American Evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.'

He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within American Evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.
