All tramcars reversed here.{{sfn|Ludlam|2006|pp=426 & 428}}{{sfn|Price|1991|loc=Front cover and p.102}}{{sfn|Mummery|Butler|1999|page=66}}{{sfn|Wilson|Barker|1998|p=360}}\n\nThe halt was the line's temporary western terminus for the eighteen months from opening until the extension to the permanent terminus at Immingham Dock was opened on 17 November 1913. Throughout this period the halt appeared on tickets as plain \"Immingham\", being permanently \"Immingham Town\" thereafter.{{sfn|Pask|1999|p=3}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between [[Grimsby]] and the dock facilities, [[Immingham Dock]] having been built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the [[Great Central Railway]] and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|page=717}} and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=112}} though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes.\n\nIn modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally and in publications such as Bradshaw as \"cars\"{{sfn|Bradshaw|1917|page=710}}{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|page=717}} or \"tramcars\", with related things being called names such as \"tramcar halt\" and \"tramcar bridge.\" \"Car\" was always a more common short form than \"tram.\"\n\n==Location and facilities==\nImmingham Town - known locally as \"Tramcar Halt\" - was situated outside the dock estate in what in 2012 was still open country. It was the nearest point to the line for its two lesser markets - railwaymen travelling to and from [[Immingham engine shed]] and residents of the village of Immingham,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=69}} by far the greatest market being dock workers. The station was nevertheless a third of a mile from the engine shed and a good mile from the village proper.\n\nThe line was a tramway, no platforms ever existed at any of the stopping places; passengers were expected to board and alight from the roadway or trackside cinders according to the location. The \"stations\" were much more commonly referred to as \"halts\" or \"stopping places.\" In the case of Immingham Town the tracks ran along a metalled road, giving passengers a firm footing at least.{{sfn|King|Hewins|1989|loc=Photo 56}}\n\nA wooden waiting shelter was provided at Immingham Town, but it gave scant protection from the elements.{{sfn|Ludlam|2006|page=427}}{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2017|loc=Photo 118}} During the [[Second World War]] this was replaced by an altogether more substantial brick shelter designed to double as an air raid shelter. This structure was still in place in 2013.\n\nPassengers bought tickets from the conductor on board the cars.\n\n==The lines from the station==\nTramcars arrived from Immingham Dock down the grooved double track southern slope of one of the two \"hills\" on the whole line, i.e. the bridge over the conventional [[Grimsby District Light Railway]] line near Immingham East Junction.{{sfn|Price|1991|page=81}} This bridge, which was in regular, heavy road use in 2015, was known locally as \"tramcar bridge.\" All cars reversed at Immingham Town, a process which took several minutes as the conductor had to unhook the rear trolley pole from the overhead wire then attach the front one, which would become the rear one on reversing. On restarting the tramcar would swing right off the public road,{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2017|loc=Photo 119}} change from grooved rails to conventional{{sfn|Bates|Bairstow|2005|page=86}} and merge to become a single track{{sfn|Price|1991|page=88}} on a reserved way running parallel to the conventional [[Grimsby District Light Railway]] line through open, marshy farmland. Tramcars running in the opposite direction followed the same procedure in reverse.\n\nThis was not quite the whole story. When the line was proposed it included plans to continue from Immingham Town southwest along Queens Road to a point near the footpath to the [[Immingham engine shed|engine shed]], or \"Loco\" as it was called locally. When the line was completed in 1913 the extension was omitted. Influential fingers were wagged so the [[Great Central Railway|company]] grudgingly built it to what would have been [[Immingham (Queens Road) electric railway station|Queens Road Halt]]. Proving tramcars ran every quarter to maintain the right of way, but no revenue earning vehicle ever traversed it.{{sfn|Dow|1965|page=242}} The overhead wires and points were removed in the Second World War{{sfn|Price|1991|page=77}} and all trace of the branch had gone by 1955.\n\n==Services==\nUnusually among British tramways services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at [[Immingham engine shed]], whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock.

All tramcars reversed here.{{sfn|Ludlam|Kennedy|2006|pp=426 & 428}}{{sfn|Price|1991|loc=Front cover and p.102}}{{sfn|Mummery|Butler|1999|page=66}}{{sfn|Wilson|Barker|October 1998|p=360}}\n\nThe halt was the line's temporary western terminus for the eighteen months from opening until the extension to the permanent terminus at Immingham Dock was opened on 17 November 1913. Throughout this period the halt appeared on tickets as plain \"Immingham\", being permanently \"Immingham Town\" thereafter.{{sfn|Pask|1999|p=3}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between [[Grimsby]] and the dock facilities, [[Immingham Dock]] having been built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the [[Great Central Railway]] and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|page=717}} and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=112}} though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes.\n\nIn modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally and in publications such as Bradshaw as \"cars\"{{sfn|Bradshaw|1917|page=710}}{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|page=717}} or \"tramcars\", with related things being called names such as \"tramcar halt\" and \"tramcar bridge.\" \"Car\" was always a more common short form than \"tram.\"\n\n==Location and facilities==\nImmingham Town - known locally as \"Tramcar Halt\" - was situated outside the dock estate in what in 2012 was still open country. It was the nearest point to the line for its two lesser markets - railwaymen travelling to and from [[Immingham engine shed]] and residents of the village of Immingham,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=69}} by far the greatest market being dock workers. The station was nevertheless a third of a mile from the engine shed and a good mile from the village proper.\n\nThe line was a tramway, no platforms ever existed at any of the stopping places; passengers were expected to board and alight from the roadway or trackside cinders according to the location. The \"stations\" were much more commonly referred to as \"halts\" or \"stopping places.\" In the case of Immingham Town the tracks ran along a metalled road, giving passengers a firm footing at least.{{sfn|King|Hewins|1989|loc=Photo 56}}\n\nA wooden waiting shelter was provided at Immingham Town, but it gave scant protection from the elements.{{sfn|Ludlam|Kennedy|2006|page=427}}{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2017|loc=Photo 118}} During the [[Second World War]] this was replaced by an altogether more substantial brick shelter designed to double as an air raid shelter. This structure was still in place in 2013.\n\nPassengers bought tickets from the conductor on board the cars.\n\n==The lines from the station==\nTramcars arrived from Immingham Dock down the grooved double track southern slope of one of the two \"hills\" on the whole line, i.e. the bridge over the conventional [[Grimsby District Light Railway]] line near Immingham East Junction.{{sfn|Price|1991|page=81}} This bridge, which was in regular, heavy road use in 2015, was known locally as \"tramcar bridge.\" All cars reversed at Immingham Town, a process which took several minutes as the conductor had to unhook the rear trolley pole from the overhead wire then attach the front one, which would become the rear one on reversing. On restarting the tramcar would swing right off the public road,{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2017|loc=Photo 119}} change from grooved rails to conventional{{sfn|Bates|Bairstow|2005|page=86}} and merge to become a single track{{sfn|Price|1991|page=88}} on a reserved way running parallel to the conventional [[Grimsby District Light Railway]] line through open, marshy farmland. Tramcars running in the opposite direction followed the same procedure in reverse.\n\nThis was not quite the whole story. When the line was proposed it included plans to continue from Immingham Town southwest along Queens Road to a point near the footpath to the [[Immingham engine shed|engine shed]], or \"Loco\" as it was called locally. When the line was completed in 1913 the extension was omitted. Influential fingers were wagged so the [[Great Central Railway|company]] grudgingly built it to what would have been [[Immingham (Queens Road) electric railway station|Queens Road Halt]]. Proving tramcars ran every quarter to maintain the right of way, but no revenue earning vehicle ever traversed it.{{sfn|Dow|1965|page=242}} The overhead wires and points were removed in the Second World War{{sfn|Price|1991|page=77}} and all trace of the branch had gone by 1955.\n\n==Services==\nUnusually among British tramways services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at [[Immingham engine shed]], whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock. It was normal for several tramcars to queue to reverse at Immingham Town at the peaks.{{sfn|Kent|1959|p=566}}\n\nIn 1956 over a million passengers used the line{{sfn|Price|1991|page=94}} and even with deliberate rundown a quarter of a million used it in its last twelve months up to closure in July 1961.\n\n==Closure==\nThe line took some years to die, being cut back at the Grimsby end in 1956 then reduced to peak services only in 1959, when it disappeared from Bradshaw and through ticketing beyond the line was withdrawn.{{sfn|Bates|Bairstow|2005|page=85}} Formal closure of the line and Immingham Town tramcar halt came on Monday 3 July 1961, with the last tramcars running on Saturday 1 July 1961, when a convoy of six tramcars set off from Immingham Dock, nominally at 14:03.{{sfn|Skelsey|2011|page=239}} The last tramcar of this convoy and therefore the last from Immingham Town was Number 4.{{sfn|Price|1991|page=102}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe first track on the line to be removed was at Dock tramcar station, to give increased parking space.

{"title_page": "State machine replication", "text_new": "\n\nIn [[computer science]],  '''state machine replication''' or '''state machine approach''' is a general method for implementing a fault-tolerant service by replicating servers and coordinating client interactions with server replicas.  The approach also provides a framework for understanding and designing replication management protocols.<ref name=\"schneider\" />\n\n==Problem definition==\n===Distributed services===\nDistributed software is often structured in terms of clients and services. Each service comprises one or more servers and exports operations that clients invoke by making requests. Although using a single, centralized server is the simplest way to implement a service, the resulting service can only be as fault tolerant as the processor executing that server. If this level of fault tolerance is unacceptable, then multiple servers that fail independently must be used. Usually, replicas of a single server are executed on separate processors of a distributed system, and protocols are used to coordinate client interactions with these replicas. The physical and electrical isolation of processors in a distributed system ensures that server failures are independent, as required.\n\n===State machine===\n{{Main|Finite-state machine}}\nFor the subsequent discussion a ''State Machine'' will be defined as the following tuple of values <ref name=reliable>{{cite journal|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|year=1978|title=The Implementation of Reliable Distributed Multiprocess Systems|journal=Computer Networks|volume=2|issue=2|pages=95\u2013114|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#implementation|accessdate=2008-03-13|doi=10.1016/0376-5075(78)90045-4}}</ref> (See also [[Mealy machine]] and [[Moore Machine]]):\n\n* A set of ''States''\n* A set of ''Inputs''\n* A set of ''Outputs''\n* A transition function (Input \u00d7 State \u2192 State)\n* An output function (Input \u00d7 State \u2192 Output)\n* A distinguished State called Start.\n\nA State Machine begins at the State labeled Start.  Each Input received is passed through the transition and output function to produce a new State and an Output.  The State is held stable until a new Input is received, while the Output is communicated to the appropriate receiver.\n\nThis discussion requires a State Machine to be '''deterministic''': multiple copies of the same State Machine begin in the Start state, and receiving the same Inputs in the same order will arrive at the same State having generated the same Outputs.\n\nTypically, systems based on State Machine Replication voluntarily restrict their implementations to use [[finite-state machine]]s to simplify error recovery.\n\n===Fault Tolerance===\nDeterminism is an ideal characteristic for providing fault-tolerance.  Intuitively, if multiple copies of a system exist, a fault in one would be noticeable as a difference in the State or Output from the others.\n\nA little deduction shows the minimum number of copies needed for fault-tolerance is three; one which has a fault, and two others to whom we compare State and Output.  Two copies are not enough as there is no way to tell which copy is the faulty one.\n\nFurther deduction shows a three-copy system can support at most one failure (after which it must repair or replace the faulty copy).  If more than one of the copies were to fail, all three States and Outputs might differ, and there would be no way to choose which is the correct one.\n\nIn general, a system which supports F failures must have 2F+1 copies (also called replicas).<ref name=lowerbounds>{{cite web|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|year=2004|title=Lower Bounds for Asynchronous Consensus|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lower-bound}}</ref> The extra copies are used as evidence to decide which of the copies are correct and which are faulty.

Each replica will generate an Output independently.  Non-faulty replicas will always produce the same Output.  Before the client response can be sent, faulty Outputs must be filtered out.  Typically, a majority of the Replicas will return the same Output, and this Output is sent as the response to the client.\n\n===System Failure===\n:If there is no majority of replicas with the same Output, or if less than a majority of replicas returns an Output, a system failure has occurred.  The client response must be the unique Output: FAIL.\n\n===Auditing and Failure Detection===\n\nThe permanent, unplanned compromise of a replica is called a ''Failure''.  Proof of failure is difficult to obtain, as the replica may simply be slow to respond,<ref name=FLP>{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael J.|author2=Nancy A. Lynch |author3=Michael S. Paterson |year=1985|title=Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process|journal=Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery|volume=32|issue=2|pages=347\u2013382|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#using-time|accessdate=2008-03-13|doi=10.1145/3149.214121}}</ref> or even lie about its status.<ref name=byzantine/>\n\nNon-faulty replicas will always contain the same State and produce the same Outputs.  This invariant enables failure detection by comparing States and Outputs of all replicas.  Typically, a replica with State or Output which differs from the majority of replicas is declared faulty.\n\nA common implementation is to pass checksums of the current replica State and recent Outputs among servers.  An Audit process at each server restarts the local replica if a deviation is detected.<ref name=live>{{cite book|last=Chandra|first=Tushar|author2=Robert Griesemer |author3=Joshua Redstone |year=2007|title=Paxos Made Live \u2013 An Engineering Perspective|journal=PODC '07: 26th ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing|pages=398\u2013407|url=http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/08w-dsi/chandra07paxos.pdf|doi=10.1145/1281100.1281103|isbn=9781595936165}}</ref>  Cryptographic security is not required for checksums.\n\nIt is possible that the local server is compromised, or that the Audit process is faulty, and the replica continues to operate incorrectly.  This case is handled safely by the Output filter described previously (see [[#Sending Outputs|Sending Outputs]]).\n\n==Appendix: Extensions==\n\n===Input Log===\n\nIn a system with no failures, the Inputs may be discarded after being processed by the State Machine.  Realistic deployments must compensate for transient non-failure behaviors of the system such as message loss, network partitions, and slow processors.<ref name=live/>\n\nOne technique is to store the series of Inputs in a log.  During times of transient behavior, replicas may request copies of a log entry from another replica in order to fill in missing Inputs.<ref name=paxos/>\n\nIn general the log is not required to be persistent (it may be held in memory).  A persistent log may compensate for extended transient periods, or support additional system features such as [[#Checkpoints|Checkpoints]], and [[#Reconfiguration|Reconfiguration]].\n\n===Checkpoints===\n\nIf left unchecked a log will grow until it exhausts all available storage resources.  For continued operation, it is necessary to forget log entries.  In general a log entry may be forgotten when its contents are no longer relevant (for instance if all replicas have processed an Input, the knowledge of the Input is no longer needed).\n\nA common technique to control log size is store a duplicate State (called a '''Checkpoint'''), then discard any log entries which contributed to the checkpoint.  This saves space when the duplicated State is smaller than the size of the log.\n\nCheckpoints may be added to any State Machine by supporting an additional Input called '''CHECKPOINT'''.  Each replica maintains a checkpoint in addition to the current State value.  When the log grows large, a replica submits the CHECKPOINT command just like a client request.  The system will ensure non-faulty replicas process this command in the same order, after which all log entries before the checkpoint may be discarded.\n\nIn a system with checkpoints, requests for log entries occurring before the checkpoint are ignored.  Replicas which cannot locate copies of a needed log entry are faulty and must re-join the system (see [[#Reconfiguration|Reconfiguration]]).\n\n===Reconfiguration===\n\nReconfiguration allows replicas to be added and removed from a system while client requests continue to be processed.  Planned maintenance and replica failure are common examples of reconfiguration.  Reconfiguration involves [[#Quitting|Quitting]] and [[#Joining|Joining]].\n\n===Quitting===\n\nWhen a server detects its State or Output is faulty (see [[#Auditing and Failure Detection|Auditing and Failure Detection]]), it may selectively exit the system.  Likewise, an administrator may manually execute a command to remove a replica for maintenance.\n\nA new Input is added to the State Machine called '''QUIT'''.<ref name=reliable/><ref name=time/>  A replica submits this command to the system just like a client request.  All non-faulty replicas remove the quitting replica from the system upon processing this Input.  During this time, the replica may ignore all protocol messages.  If a majority of non-faulty replicas remain, the quit is successful.  If not, there is a [[#System Failure|System Failure]].\n\n===Joining===\n\nAfter quitting, a failed server may selectively restart or re-join the system.  Likewise, an administrator may add a new replica to the group for additional capacity.\n\nA new Input is added to the State Machine called '''JOIN'''.  A replica submits this command to the system just like a client request.  All non-faulty replicas add the joining node to the system upon processing this Input.  A new replica must be up-to-date on the system's State before joining (see [[#State Transfer|State Transfer]]).\n\n===State Transfer===\n\nWhen a new replica is made available or an old replica is restarted, it must be brought up to the current State before processing Inputs (see [[#Joining|Joining]]).  Logically, this requires applying every Input from the dawn of the system in the appropriate order.\n\nTypical deployments short-circuit the logical flow by performing a State Transfer of the most recent Checkpoint (see [[#Checkpoints|Checkpoints]]).  This involves directly copying the State of one replica to another using an out-of-band protocol.\n\nA checkpoint may be large, requiring an extended transfer period.  During this time, new Inputs may be added to the log.  If this occurs, the new replica must also receive the new Inputs and apply them after the checkpoint is received.  Typical deployments add the new replica as an observer to the ordering protocol before beginning the state transfer, allowing the new replica to collect Inputs during this period.\n\n:'''Optimizing State Transfer'''\n:Common deployments reduce state transfer times by sending only State components which differ.  This requires knowledge of the State Machine internals.  Since state transfer is usually an out-of-band protocol, this assumption is not difficult to achieve.\n\n:Compression is another feature commonly added to state transfer protocols, reducing the size of the total transfer.\n\n===Leader Election (for Paxos)===\n\n'''[[Paxos algorithm|Paxos]]'''<ref name=paxos>{{cite journal|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|date=May 1998|title=The Part-Time Parliament|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer Systems|volume=16|issue=2|pages=133\u2013169|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-paxos|accessdate=2007-02-02|doi=10.1145/279227.279229}}</ref> is a protocol for solving consensus, and may be used as the protocol for implementing [[#Consensus Order|Consensus Order]].\n\nPaxos requires a single leader to ensure liveness.<ref name=paxos/>  That is, one of the replicas must remain leader long enough to achieve consensus on the next operation of the state machine.  System behavior is unaffected if the leader changes after every instance, or if the leader changes multiple times per instance.  The only requirement is that one replica remains leader long enough to move the system forward.\n\n:'''Conflict Resolution'''\n:In general, a leader is necessary only when there is disagreement about which operation to perform,<ref name=fast/> and if those operations conflict in some way (for instance, if they do not commute).<ref name=general/>\n\n:When conflicting operations are proposed, the leader acts as the single authority to set the record straight, defining an order for the operations, allowing the system to make progress.\n\nWith Paxos, multiple replicas may believe they are leaders at the same time.  This property makes Leader Election for Paxos very simple, and any algorithm which guarantees an 'eventual leader' will work.\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n[[Leslie Lamport]] was the first to propose the state machine approach, in his seminal 1984 paper on [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/using-time.pdf \"Using Time Instead of Timeout In Distributed Systems\"].  Fred Schneider later elaborated the approach in his paper [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf \"Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial\"].\n\n[[Ken Birman]] developed the [[virtual synchrony]] model in a series of papers published between 1985 and 1987.  The primary reference to this work is [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37515&dl=ACM&coll=GUIDE \"Exploiting Virtual Synchrony in Distributed Systems\"], which describes the Isis Toolkit, a system that  was used to build the New York and Swiss Stock Exchanges, French Air Traffic Control System, US Navy AEGIS Warship, and other applications.\n\nRecent work by Miguel Castro and [[Barbara Liskov]] used the state machine approach in what they call a [http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/osdi99_html/osdi99.html \"Practical Byzantine fault tolerance\"] architecture that replicates especially sensitive services using a version of Lamport's original state machine approach, but with optimizations that substantially improve performance.\n\nMost recently, there was also created the BFT-SMaRt library,<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/bft-smart/ BFT-SMaRt]. Google Code repository for the BFT-SMaRt replication library.</ref> a high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication library developed in Java. This library implements a protocol very similar to PBFT's, plus complementary protocols which offer state transfer and on-the-fly reconfiguration of hosts (i.e., JOIN and LEAVE operations). BFT-SMaRt is the most recent effort to implement state machine replication, still being actively maintained.\n\n[[Raft_(computer_science)|Raft]], a consensus based algorithm, was developed in 2013.\n\nMotivated by PBFT, Tendermint BFT<ref>{{cite arxiv | first1 = E. | last1 = Buchman | first2 = J. | last2 = Kwon | first3 = Z. | last3 = Milosevic | title = The latest gossip on BFT consensus | eprint = 1807.04938 | date = 2018 | class = cs.DC }}</ref>  was introduced for partial asynchronous networks and it is mainly used for Proof of Stake blockchains. Recently, [[Yongge Wang]]  showed that Tendermint BFT cannot achieve liveness in partial synchronous networks and proposed a more efficient BFT protocol BDLS<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = Yongge | last1 = Wang | title = Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Partially Connected Asynchronous Networks | journal = Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2019/1460 | publisher = IACR ePrint | date = 2019 | url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1460/20200211:001341}}</ref> for partial synchronous networks.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120516085919/http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/18986 Replicated state machines video on MIT TechTV]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150308214635/http://zookeeper.apache.org/bookkeeper/ Apache Bookkeeper] a replicated log service which can be used to build replicated state machines\n{{DEFAULTSORT:State Machine Replication}}\n[[Category:Distributed computing problems]]\n[[Category:Data synchronization]]\n[[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]]\n", "text_old": "\n\nIn [[computer science]],  '''state machine replication''' or '''state machine approach''' is a general method for implementing a fault-tolerant service by replicating servers and coordinating client interactions with server replicas.  The approach also provides a framework for understanding and designing replication management protocols.<ref name=\"schneider\" />\n\n==Problem definition==\n===Distributed services===\nDistributed software is often structured in terms of clients and services. Each service comprises one or more servers and exports operations that clients invoke by making requests. Although using a single, centralized server is the simplest way to implement a service, the resulting service can only be as fault tolerant as the processor executing that server. If this level of fault tolerance is unacceptable, then multiple servers that fail independently must be used. Usually, replicas of a single server are executed on separate processors of a distributed system, and protocols are used to coordinate client interactions with these replicas. The physical and electrical isolation of processors in a distributed system ensures that server failures are independent, as required.\n\n===State machine===\n{{Main|Finite-state machine}}\nFor the subsequent discussion a ''State Machine'' will be defined as the following tuple of values <ref name=reliable>{{cite journal|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|year=1978|title=The Implementation of Reliable Distributed Multiprocess Systems|journal=Computer Networks|volume=2|issue=2|pages=95\u2013114|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#implementation|accessdate=2008-03-13|doi=10.1016/0376-5075(78)90045-4}}</ref> (See also [[Mealy machine]] and [[Moore Machine]]):\n\n* A set of ''States''\n* A set of ''Inputs''\n* A set of ''Outputs''\n* A transition function (Input \u00d7 State \u2192 State)\n* An output function (Input \u00d7 State \u2192 Output)\n* A distinguished State called Start.\n\nA State Machine begins at the State labeled Start.  Each Input received is passed through the transition and output function to produce a new State and an Output.  The State is held stable until a new Input is received, while the Output is communicated to the appropriate receiver.\n\nThis discussion requires a State Machine to be '''deterministic''': multiple copies of the same State Machine begin in the Start state, and receiving the same Inputs in the same order will arrive at the same State having generated the same Outputs.\n\nTypically, systems based on State Machine Replication voluntarily restrict their implementations to use [[finite-state machine]]s to simplify error recovery.\n\n===Fault Tolerance===\nDeterminism is an ideal characteristic for providing fault-tolerance.  Intuitively, if multiple copies of a system exist, a fault in one would be noticeable as a difference in the State or Output from the others.\n\nA little deduction shows the minimum number of copies needed for fault-tolerance is three; one which has a fault, and two others to whom we compare State and Output.  Two copies are not enough as there is no way to tell which copy is the faulty one.\n\nFurther deduction shows a three-copy system can support at most one failure (after which it must repair or replace the faulty copy).  If more than one of the copies were to fail, all three States and Outputs might differ, and there would be no way to choose which is the correct one.\n\nIn general, a system which supports F failures must have 2F+1 copies (also called replicas).<ref name=lowerbounds>{{cite web|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|year=2004|title=Lower Bounds for Asynchronous Consensus|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lower-bound}}</ref> The extra copies are used as evidence to decide which of the copies are correct and which are faulty.

This problem becomes difficult when the participants or their communication medium may experience failures.<ref name=\"lowerbounds\"/>\n\nInputs may be ordered by their position in the series of consensus instances ('''Consensus Order''').<ref name=paxos/>  Consensus Order may be derived independently by each server.  Inputs to the State Machine may be executed in Consensus Order, guaranteeing consistent State and Output for all non-faulty replicas.\n\n:'''Optimizing Causal & Consensus Ordering'''\n:In some cases additional information is available (such as real-time clocks).  In these cases, it is possible to achieve more efficient causal or consensus ordering for the Inputs, with a reduced number of messages, fewer message rounds, or smaller message sizes.

Each replica will generate an Output independently.  Non-faulty replicas will always produce the same Output.  Before the client response can be sent, faulty Outputs must be filtered out.  Typically, a majority of the Replicas will return the same Output, and this Output is sent as the response to the client.\n\n===System Failure===\n:If there is no majority of replicas with the same Output, or if less than a majority of replicas returns an Output, a system failure has occurred.  The client response must be the unique Output: FAIL.\n\n===Auditing and Failure Detection===\n\nThe permanent, unplanned compromise of a replica is called a ''Failure''.  Proof of failure is difficult to obtain, as the replica may simply be slow to respond,<ref name=FLP>{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael J.|author2=Nancy A. Lynch |author3=Michael S. Paterson |year=1985|title=Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process|journal=Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery|volume=32|issue=2|pages=347\u2013382|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#using-time|accessdate=2008-03-13|doi=10.1145/3149.214121}}</ref> or even lie about its status.<ref name=byzantine/>\n\nNon-faulty replicas will always contain the same State and produce the same Outputs.  This invariant enables failure detection by comparing States and Outputs of all replicas.  Typically, a replica with State or Output which differs from the majority of replicas is declared faulty.\n\nA common implementation is to pass checksums of the current replica State and recent Outputs among servers.  An Audit process at each server restarts the local replica if a deviation is detected.<ref name=live>{{cite book|last=Chandra|first=Tushar|author2=Robert Griesemer |author3=Joshua Redstone |year=2007|title=Paxos Made Live \u2013 An Engineering Perspective|journal=PODC '07: 26th ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing|pages=398\u2013407|url=http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/08w-dsi/chandra07paxos.pdf|doi=10.1145/1281100.1281103|isbn=9781595936165}}</ref>  Cryptographic security is not required for checksums.\n\nIt is possible that the local server is compromised, or that the Audit process is faulty, and the replica continues to operate incorrectly.  This case is handled safely by the Output filter described previously (see [[#Sending Outputs|Sending Outputs]]).\n\n==Appendix: Extensions==\n\n===Input Log===\n\nIn a system with no failures, the Inputs may be discarded after being processed by the State Machine.  Realistic deployments must compensate for transient non-failure behaviors of the system such as message loss, network partitions, and slow processors.<ref name=live/>\n\nOne technique is to store the series of Inputs in a log.  During times of transient behavior, replicas may request copies of a log entry from another replica in order to fill in missing Inputs.<ref name=paxos/>\n\nIn general the log is not required to be persistent (it may be held in memory).  A persistent log may compensate for extended transient periods, or support additional system features such as [[#Checkpoints|Checkpoints]], and [[#Reconfiguration|Reconfiguration]].\n\n===Checkpoints===\n\nIf left unchecked a log will grow until it exhausts all available storage resources.  For continued operation, it is necessary to forget log entries.  In general a log entry may be forgotten when its contents are no longer relevant (for instance if all replicas have processed an Input, the knowledge of the Input is no longer needed).\n\nA common technique to control log size is store a duplicate State (called a '''Checkpoint'''), then discard any log entries which contributed to the checkpoint.  This saves space when the duplicated State is smaller than the size of the log.\n\nCheckpoints may be added to any State Machine by supporting an additional Input called '''CHECKPOINT'''.  Each replica maintains a checkpoint in addition to the current State value.  When the log grows large, a replica submits the CHECKPOINT command just like a client request.  The system will ensure non-faulty replicas process this command in the same order, after which all log entries before the checkpoint may be discarded.\n\nIn a system with checkpoints, requests for log entries occurring before the checkpoint are ignored.  Replicas which cannot locate copies of a needed log entry are faulty and must re-join the system (see [[#Reconfiguration|Reconfiguration]]).\n\n===Reconfiguration===\n\nReconfiguration allows replicas to be added and removed from a system while client requests continue to be processed.  Planned maintenance and replica failure are common examples of reconfiguration.  Reconfiguration involves [[#Quitting|Quitting]] and [[#Joining|Joining]].\n\n===Quitting===\n\nWhen a server detects its State or Output is faulty (see [[#Auditing and Failure Detection|Auditing and Failure Detection]]), it may selectively exit the system.  Likewise, an administrator may manually execute a command to remove a replica for maintenance.\n\nA new Input is added to the State Machine called '''QUIT'''.<ref name=reliable/><ref name=time/>  A replica submits this command to the system just like a client request.  All non-faulty replicas remove the quitting replica from the system upon processing this Input.  During this time, the replica may ignore all protocol messages.  If a majority of non-faulty replicas remain, the quit is successful.  If not, there is a [[#System Failure|System Failure]].\n\n===Joining===\n\nAfter quitting, a failed server may selectively restart or re-join the system.  Likewise, an administrator may add a new replica to the group for additional capacity.\n\nA new Input is added to the State Machine called '''JOIN'''.  A replica submits this command to the system just like a client request.  All non-faulty replicas add the joining node to the system upon processing this Input.  A new replica must be up-to-date on the system's State before joining (see [[#State Transfer|State Transfer]]).\n\n===State Transfer===\n\nWhen a new replica is made available or an old replica is restarted, it must be brought up to the current State before processing Inputs (see [[#Joining|Joining]]).  Logically, this requires applying every Input from the dawn of the system in the appropriate order.\n\nTypical deployments short-circuit the logical flow by performing a State Transfer of the most recent Checkpoint (see [[#Checkpoints|Checkpoints]]).  This involves directly copying the State of one replica to another using an out-of-band protocol.\n\nA checkpoint may be large, requiring an extended transfer period.  During this time, new Inputs may be added to the log.  If this occurs, the new replica must also receive the new Inputs and apply them after the checkpoint is received.  Typical deployments add the new replica as an observer to the ordering protocol before beginning the state transfer, allowing the new replica to collect Inputs during this period.\n\n:'''Optimizing State Transfer'''\n:Common deployments reduce state transfer times by sending only State components which differ.  This requires knowledge of the State Machine internals.  Since state transfer is usually an out-of-band protocol, this assumption is not difficult to achieve.\n\n:Compression is another feature commonly added to state transfer protocols, reducing the size of the total transfer.\n\n===Leader Election (for Paxos)===\n\n'''[[Paxos algorithm|Paxos]]'''<ref name=paxos>{{cite journal|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|date=May 1998|title=The Part-Time Parliament|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer Systems|volume=16|issue=2|pages=133\u2013169|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-paxos|accessdate=2007-02-02|doi=10.1145/279227.279229}}</ref> is a protocol for solving consensus, and may be used as the protocol for implementing [[#Consensus Order|Consensus Order]].\n\nPaxos requires a single leader to ensure liveness.<ref name=paxos/>  That is, one of the replicas must remain leader long enough to achieve consensus on the next operation of the state machine.  System behavior is unaffected if the leader changes after every instance, or if the leader changes multiple times per instance.  The only requirement is that one replica remains leader long enough to move the system forward.\n\n:'''Conflict Resolution'''\n:In general, a leader is necessary only when there is disagreement about which operation to perform,<ref name=fast/> and if those operations conflict in some way (for instance, if they do not commute).<ref name=general/>\n\n:When conflicting operations are proposed, the leader acts as the single authority to set the record straight, defining an order for the operations, allowing the system to make progress.\n\nWith Paxos, multiple replicas may believe they are leaders at the same time.  This property makes Leader Election for Paxos very simple, and any algorithm which guarantees an 'eventual leader' will work.\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n[[Leslie Lamport]] was the first to propose the state machine approach, in his seminal 1984 paper on [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/using-time.pdf \"Using Time Instead of Timeout In Distributed Systems\"].  Fred Schneider later elaborated the approach in his paper [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf \"Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial\"].\n\n[[Ken Birman]] developed the [[virtual synchrony]] model in a series of papers published between 1985 and 1987.  The primary reference to this work is [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37515&dl=ACM&coll=GUIDE \"Exploiting Virtual Synchrony in Distributed Systems\"], which describes the Isis Toolkit, a system that  was used to build the New York and Swiss Stock Exchanges, French Air Traffic Control System, US Navy AEGIS Warship, and other applications.\n\nRecent work by Miguel Castro and [[Barbara Liskov]] used the state machine approach in what they call a [http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/osdi99_html/osdi99.html \"Practical Byzantine fault tolerance\"] architecture that replicates especially sensitive services using a version of Lamport's original state machine approach, but with optimizations that substantially improve performance.\n\nMost recently, there was also created the BFT-SMaRt library,<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/bft-smart/ BFT-SMaRt]. Google Code repository for the BFT-SMaRt replication library.</ref> a high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication library developed in Java. This library implements a protocol very similar to PBFT's, plus complementary protocols which offer state transfer and on-the-fly reconfiguration of hosts (i.e., JOIN and LEAVE operations). BFT-SMaRt is the most recent effort to implement state machine replication, still being actively maintained.\n\n[[Raft_(computer_science)|Raft]], a consensus based algorithm, was developed in 2013.\n\nMotivated by PBFT, Tendermint BFT<ref>{{cite arxiv | first1 = E. | last1 = Buchman | first2 = J. | last2 = Kwon | first3 = Z. | last3 = Milosevic | title = The latest gossip on BFT consensus | eprint = 1807.04938 | date = 2018 | class = cs.DC }}</ref>  was introduced for partial asynchronous networks and it is mainly used for Proof of Stake Proof blockchains.

The Terminal Services Edition of NT 4.0 relied on [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]]'s MultiWin technology, previously provided as a part of [[Citrix WinFrame]] atop Windows NT 3.51, in order to support multiple users and login sessions simultaneously. Microsoft required Citrix to license their MultiWin technology to Microsoft in order to be allowed to continue offering their own terminal-services product, then named Citrix MetaFrame, atop Windows NT 4.0. The Citrix-provided DLLs included in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Services Edition still carry a Citrix copyright rather than a Microsoft copyright. Later versions of Windows integrated the necessary support directly. The T.128 application sharing technology was acquired by Microsoft from UK software developer Data Connection Limited.<ref>Implementing Collaboration Technologies in Industry, Bj\u00f8rn Erik Munkvold, 2003; Chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Version 5.0 ===\nThis version was introduced with [[Windows 2000#Server family functionality|Windows 2000 Server]], added support for a number of features, including printing to local printers, and aimed to improve network bandwidth usage.\n\n=== Version 5.1 ===\nThis version was introduced with [[Windows XP]] Professional and included support for 24-bit color and sound.

The Terminal Services Edition of NT 4.0 relied on [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]]'s MultiWin technology, previously provided as a part of [[Citrix WinFrame]] atop Windows NT 3.51, in order to support multiple users and login sessions simultaneously. Microsoft required Citrix to license their MultiWin technology to Microsoft in order to be allowed to continue offering their own terminal-services product, then named Citrix MetaFrame, atop Windows NT 4.0.

For instance, the open-source command-line client [[rdesktop]] is available for Linux/Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems. There are many GUI clients, like [[tsclient]] and [[KRDC]], that are built on top of rdesktop; [[CoRD]] is such a client for the Macintosh.<ref name=rdesktop/>\n\nIn 2009, rdesktop was forked as FreeRDP, a new project aiming at modularizing the code, addressing various issues, and implementing new features. FreeRDP comes with its own command-line-client xfreerdp, which supports Seamless Windows in RDP6.<ref>{{cite web |title=FreeRDP-old README |url=https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP-old |website=GitHub |language=en |date=2010 |quote=FreeRDP is a successor to rdesktop, a longtime-favored application for use on *nix systems to access Windows servers and workstations.

The Windows Remote Desktop Connection client can be used to connect to such a server.\n\nProprietary RDP client solutions such as [[rdpclient]] are available as a stand-alone application or embedded with client hardware. A new access paradigm, browser-based access, has enabled users to access Windows desktops and applications on any RDP hosts, such as Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDS) Session Hosts (Terminal Services) and virtual desktops, as well as remote physical PCs. \n\nThere is also a VirtualBox Remote Display Protocol (VRDP) used in the [[VirtualBox]] virtual machine implementation by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].<ref>{{cite web |title=VirtualBox Manual: 7.1.
