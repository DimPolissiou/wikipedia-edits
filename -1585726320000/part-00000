He was a subscriber to the third charter of the [[Virginia Company]] who emigrated to the colony in 1618. After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].  In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England. By the time of his death around 1637, Farrar had sold off his remaining assets in England and established rights to a 2000 acre patent on [[Farrar's Island]], located on a curl of the James River.\n\n[[File:Farrar Complete Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms|arms]] of William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire<ref name= Bannerman1899/>]]\n\n==Background==\nWilliam Farrar was born before April 28, 1583,<ref name=\"Dorman2004\" /> the date of his christening, in [[Croxton, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=CroxtonParish1583 /> He was the 3rd son of John Farrar of Croxton<ref name= \"Bannerman1899\" /> and London, [[Esquire]], a wealthy [[merchant]] and [[Land tenure|landowner]] with various holdings in [[West Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], and [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name =Farrer1936/>, and Cecily Kelke, an heiress <ref name=Richardson2011/> and direct descendant of [[Edward III of England]].<ref name=ElleMagazine2014/> The nineteenth century historian of Virginia, [[Alexander Brown (author)|Alexander Brown]], states that while in England, William Farrar received an education in law.<ref name=Brown1890v2 />\n\n== Relation to the Virginia Company and emigration to the New World ==\n[[File:Nova Britannia Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile cover of \"Nova Britannia\", a tract from Farrar's time used to recruit people to Virginia.]]\nWhen Farrar went to Virginia, it was still part of the [[Virginia Company of London]], a [[joint-stock company]], sanctioned by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]].<ref name=\"Wolfe2016\" /> Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company,<ref name= Kolp2014 /> where his name appears as \"William Ferrers\".<ref name= Bemiss1957 /> His subscription consisted of three shares that were bought for a total of \u00a337 10s (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{ To USD round|{{inflation|UK|37.5|1600}}|GBR|sf=3}}}} today).{{Notetag|For another comparison of the share's value, the entire annual wages of a skilled [[journeyman]] in London around 1588 was authorized to be between \u00a34 and \u00a310. {{refn|name=Aughterson1998}} }}<ref name=Brown1890v2 /> Farrar also had family interests in the Virginia Company as two of his second cousins,<ref name=Torrence1942 /> the brothers [[John Ferrar]] and [[Nicholas Ferrar]], played key roles in the managing the company's interests.<ref name=Kingsbury1906v1/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini01virg_0/page/n121/mode/2up 60}} }}\n\nFarrar left London on ''Neptune''<ref name= Hotten1874/> on March 16, 1617/18  {{notetag|[[Dual dating]] is given because the English new year did not begin until March 25 during the time Virginia was colonized.

After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].  In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England.

The warhead functions by having the explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity [[superplasticity|superplastic]] jet. This superplastic jet is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD) but is usually used to immobilize or destroy tanks. Due to the way they work, they do not have to be fired as fast as an [[armor piercing shell]], allowing less recoil. Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym HEAT), the jet does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely kinetic in nature. The HEAT warhead has become less effective against tanks and other armored vehicles due to the use of [[composite armor]], [[Reactive armour#Explosive reactive armor|explosive-reactive armor]], and active protection systems which destroy the HEAT warhead before it hits the tank. While HEAT ammunition has become less effective against the composite armor found on MBTs from 1964 onward, indeed, now they pose very little threat to any tank, even from the sides, they are still deadly against lighter vehicles. In addition, air vehicles are also possible targets.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:PIAT projectile diagram.jpg|thumb|upright|Diagram of [[PIAT]] ammunition]] HEAT warheads were developed during [[World War II]], from extensive research and development into [[shaped charge]] warheads. Shaped charge warheads were promoted internationally by the Swiss inventor [[Henry Mohaupt]], who exhibited the weapon before World War II. Before 1939, Mohaupt demonstrated his invention to British and French ordnance authorities. Concurrent development by the German inventor's group of Cranz, [[Schardin]], and Thomanek led to the first documented use of shaped charges in warfare, during the successful assault on the fortress of [[Eben Emael]] on 10 May 1940.\n\nClaims for priority of invention are difficult to resolve due to subsequent historic interpretations, secrecy, espionage, and international commercial interest.<ref>Donald R. Kennedy, ''History of the Shaped Charge Effect, The First 100 Years&nbsp;\u2014 USA \u2013 1983'', Defense Technology Support Services Publication, 1983</ref>\n\nThe first British HEAT weapon to be developed and issued was a [[rifle grenade]] using a {{convert|63.5|mm|in}} cup launcher on the end of the rifle barrel; the [[No 68 AT Grenade|Grenade, Rifle No. 68 /AT]] which was first issued to the [[British Armed Forces]] in the year 1940. This has some claim to have been the first HEAT warhead and launcher in use. The design of the warhead was simple and was capable of penetrating {{convert|52|mm|in}} of armor.<ref name=Eather>R F Eather, BSc & N Griffith, OBE MSc \u2013 ''Some Historical Aspects of the Development of Shaped Charges'' \u2013 Ministry of Defence, Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment \u2013 1984 \u2013 page 6 \u2013 AD-A144 098</ref> The [[fuze]] of the grenade was armed by removing a pin in the tail which prevented the [[firing pin]] from flying forward. Simple fins gave it stability in the air and, provided the grenade hit the target at the proper angle of 90 degrees, the charge would be effective. [[Detonation]] occurred on impact, when a striker in the tail of the grenade overcame the resistance of a creep spring and was thrown forward into a stab [[detonator]].\n\nBy mid-1940, Germany introduced the first HEAT round to be fired by a gun, the 7.5&nbsp;cm Gr.38 Hl/A, (later editions B and C) fired by the KwK.37 L/24 of the [[Panzer IV]] tank and the [[Stug III]] self-propelled gun . In mid-1941, Germany started the production of HEAT rifle-grenades, first issued to [[paratrooper]]s and, by 1942, to the regular army units (''Gewehr-Panzergranate 40'', ''46'' and ''61''), but, just as did the British, soon turned to integrated warhead-delivery systems: In 1943 the ''[[8.8 cm Raketenwerfer 43|P\u00fcppchen]]'', ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' and ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' were introduced.\n\n[[File: Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-671-7483-29, Reichsgebiet, Soldat mit Panzerabwehrwaffe.jpg|left|thumb|The German ''Panzerschreck'' was lethal at close range against armored vehicles]]\nThe ''Panzerfaust'' and ''Panzerschreck'' (tank fist and tank terror, respectively) gave the German infantryman the ability to destroy any tank on the battlefield from 50\u2013150 meters with relative ease of use and training (unlike the British [[PIAT]]). The Germans made use of large quantities of HEAT ammunition in converted [[7.5 cm Pak 97/38]] guns from 1942, also fabricating HEAT warheads for the ''[[Mistel]]'' weapon. These so-called ''Schwere Hohlladung'' (heavy shaped charge) warheads were intended for use against heavily armored [[battleship]]s. Operational versions weighed nearly two tons and were perhaps the largest HEAT warheads ever deployed.<ref name=mistel>http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA497450, A Brief History of Shaped Charges - Defense Technical Information, pg. 9</ref> A five-ton version code-named ''Beethoven'' was also developed.\n \nMeanwhile, the British [[No. 68 AT Grenade|No. 68 AT rifle grenade]] was proving to be too light to deal significant damage, resulting in it rarely being used in action. Due to these limits, a new infantry anti-tank weapon was needed, and this ultimately came in the form of the \"projector, infantry, anti-tank\" or [[PIAT]]. By 1942, the PIAT had been developed by Major [[Millis Jefferis]]. It was a combination of a HEAT warhead with a [[spigot mortar]] delivery system. While cumbersome, the weapon allowed British infantry to engage armor at range for the first time. The earlier magnetic hand-mines and grenades required them to approach dangerously near.<ref>Ian Hogg, ''Grenades and Mortars'' Weapons Book #37, 1974, Ballantine Books</ref> During World War II the British referred to the Monroe effect as the \"cavity effect on explosives\".<ref name=\"The Bazookas Grandfather.\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=4dTRTu6lLsvUgAed8uifDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&q&f=true \"The Bazookas Grandfather.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508112835/https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=4dTRTu6lLsvUgAed8uifDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&q&f=true |date=2016-05-08 }} ''Popular Science'', February 1945, p. 66, 2nd paragraph.</ref>\n\nDuring the war, the French communicated Henry Mohaupt's technology to the U.S. Ordnance Department, and he was invited to the US, where he worked as a consultant on the [[Bazooka]] project.\n\nThe need for a large bore made HEAT rounds relatively ineffective in existing small-caliber anti-tank guns of the era. Germany worked around this with the [[Stielgranate 41]], introducing a round that was placed over the end on the outside of otherwise obsolete {{convert|37|mm|in}} anti-tank guns to produce a medium-range low-velocity weapon.\n\nAdaptations to existing tank guns were somewhat more difficult, although all major forces had done so by the end of the war. Since velocity has little effect on the armor-piercing ability of the round, which is defined by explosive power, HEAT rounds were particularly useful in long-range combat where slower [[terminal velocity]] was not an issue. The Germans were again the ones to produce the most capable gun-fired HEAT rounds, using a [[driving band]] on bearings to allow it to fly unspun from their existing rifled tank guns. The HEAT round was particularly useful to them because it allowed the low-velocity large-bore guns used on their many [[assault gun]]s to also become useful anti-tank weapons.\n\nLikewise, the Germans, Italians, and Japanese had in service many obsolescent ''infantry guns'', short-barreled, low-velocity artillery pieces capable of direct and indirect fire and intended for infantry support, similar in tactical role to [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]; generally an infantry battalion had a battery of four or six. High-explosive anti-tank rounds for these old infantry guns made them semi-useful anti-tank guns, particularly the German {{convert|150|mm|in}} guns (the Japanese 70&nbsp; mm [[Type 92 Battalion Gun|Type 92 battalion gun]] and Italian [[65 mm mountain gun]] also had HEAT rounds available for them by 1944 but they were not very effective).\n\nHigh-explosive anti-tank rounds caused a revolution in anti-tank warfare when they were first introduced in the later stages of World War II. One infantryman could effectively destroy any existing tank with a handheld weapon, thereby dramatically altering the nature of mobile operations. During World War II, weapons using HEAT warheads were termed ''hollow charge'' or ''shape charge'' warheads.<ref name=\"The Bazookas Grandfather.\" />\n\n=== Post war ===\n[[File:125mm BK-14m HEAT.JPG|thumb|Soviet 125&nbsp;mm HEAT BK-14]]\nThe general public remained in the dark about shape charge warheads, even believing that it was a new secret explosive, until early 1945 when the US Army cooperated with the US monthly publication ''[[Popular Science]]'' on a large and detailed article on the subject titled ''It makes steel flow like mud''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=65&query=makes+steel+flow+like+mud|title=\"It makes steel flow like mud\"|work=Popular Science|accessdate=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026194843/http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=65&query=makes+steel+flow+like+mud|archive-date=26 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was this article that revealed to the American public how the fabled Bazooka actually worked against tanks and that the velocity of the rocket was irrelevant.\n\nAfter the war, HEAT rounds became almost universal as the primary anti-tank weapon. Variants of varying effectiveness were produced for almost all weapons from infantry weapons like [[rifle grenade]]s and the [[M203 grenade launcher]], to larger dedicated anti-tank systems like the [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]. When combined with the [[wire-guided missile]], infantry weapons were able to operate at long-ranges also. Anti-tank missiles altered the nature of tank warfare throughout the 1960s and into the 80s, and remain effective to this day.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Effect ===\n[[File: Obus 501556 fh000021.jpg|thumb|Cut-away view of a HEAT round; the copper-lined conical shaped area can be clearly seen]]\n{{further|Munroe effect}}\nThe stream moves at [[hypersonic]] speeds in solid material and therefore erodes exclusively in the contact area of jet and armor material. The correct detonation point of the warhead and spacing is critical for optimum penetration, for two reasons:\n\n# If the HEAT warhead is detonated too near a target's surface, there is not enough time for the particle stream to fully develop. That is why most modern HEAT warheads have what is called a ''standoff'', in the form of an extended nose cap or probe in front of the warhead.<ref group=notes>Both the US TOW and the French-German MILAN wire-guided antitank missiles almost doubled their maximum penetration by the addition of a standoff probe.</ref>\n# The distance is critical because the stream disintegrates and disperses after a short distance, usually well under 2 meters. The stream material is formed by a cone of metal foil lining, usually [[copper]], though [[ductile iron]] and [[tin]] foil was commonly used during [[World War II]].\n\nThe key to the effectiveness of a HEAT round is the diameter of the [[warhead]]. As the penetration continues through the armor, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic ''fist to finger'' penetration, where the size of the eventual ''finger'' is based on the size of the original ''fist''. In general, very early HEAT rounds could expect to penetrate armor of 150% to 250% of their diameters, and these numbers were typical of early weapons used during World War II. Since then, the penetration of HEAT rounds relative to projectile diameters has steadily increased as a result of improved liner material and metal jet performance. Some modern examples claim numbers as high as 700%.<ref>''Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994'', pp. 140\u2013141, addresses the reported \u2248700 mm penetration of the Swedish 106 3A-HEAT-T and Austrian RAT 700 HEAT projectiles for the 106&nbsp; mm M40A1 recoilless rifle.</ref>\n\n=== Stabilization and accuracy ===\n[[File: M113 damage.jpg|thumb|HEAT warhead damage on an [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]]]\nHEAT warheads are less effective if spinning, and grow ever less effective with faster spin. This became a challenge for weapon designers: for a long time, spinning a shell was the most standard method to obtain good accuracy, as with any [[Rifling|rifled]] gun. However, the [[centrifugal force]] of a spinning shell disperses the charged jet. Thus, most hollow charge projectiles are fin-stabilized and not spin-stabilized.<ref name=\"fas\">{{cite web | url =http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/bullets2.htm | title =Big Bullets for Beginners | work =Federation of American Scientists | accessdate =2011-04-24 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110525005338/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/bullets2.htm | archive-date =2011-05-25 | url-status =live | df = }}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, it has become possible to use shaped charges in spin-stabilized projectiles by imparting an opposite spin on the jet so that the two spins cancel out and result in a non-spinning jet. This is done either using [[fluting (firearms)|fluted]] copper liners, which have raised ridges, or by forming the liner in such a way that it has a crystalline structure which imparts spin to the jet.<ref>{{cite conference | conference=12th International Symposium on Ballistics, San Antonio, TX, 30 Oct. - 1 Nov. 1990 | title = Spinning Jets from Shaped Charges with Flow Turned Liners | first = Manfred | last = Held |bibcode=1990ball.sympR....H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Liners%20for%20Shaped%20Charges%20by%20Manfred%20Held%20(2001).pdf | title=Liners for shaped charges | work=Journal of Battlefield Technology | first=Manfred | last=Held | date=November 2001 | volume=4 | number=3 | journal= | access-date=2011-08-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819124810/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Liners%20for%20Shaped%20Charges%20by%20Manfred%20Held%20(2001).pdf | archive-date=2011-08-19 | url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBesides spin-stabilization, another problem with any barreled weapon (that is, a gun) is that a large-diameter shell has worse accuracy than a small-diameter shell of the same weight. The lessening of accuracy increases dramatically with range. Paradoxically, this leads to situations when a [[kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic armor-piercing projectile]] is ''more'' usable at long ranges than a HEAT projectile, despite the latter having a ''higher'' armor penetration. To illustrate this: a stationary Soviet [[T-62]] tank, firing a (smoothbore) cannon at a range of 1000 meters against a target moving 19&nbsp; km/h was rated to have a first-round hit probability of 70% when firing a [[APFSDS|kinetic projectile]]. Under the same conditions, it could expect 25% when firing a HEAT round.<ref>''Jane's Armour and Artillery 1981\u201382'', p. 55.</ref> This affects combat on the open battlefield with long lines of sight; the same T-62 could expect a 70% first-round hit probability using HEAT rounds on target at 500 meters.\n\nA further problem is that, if the warhead is contained inside the barrel, its diameter becomes overly restricted by the [[caliber]] of that barrel. In non-gun applications, when HEAT warheads are delivered with [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, [[bomb]]s, [[grenade]]s, or [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|spigot mortars]], the warhead size is no longer a limiting factor. In these cases, HEAT warheads often seem oversized in relation to the round's body. Classic examples of this include the German [[Panzerfaust]] and Soviet [[RPG-7]].\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:125mm 3BK29 HEAT.JPG|thumb|A Russian 3BK29 HEAT round]]\nMany HEAT-armed missiles today have two (or more) separate warheads (termed a [[tandem charge]]) to be more effective against reactive or multi-layered armor. The first, smaller warhead initiates the reactive armor, while the second (or other), larger warhead penetrates the armor below. This approach requires highly sophisticated fuzing electronics to set off the two warheads the correct time apart, and also special barriers between the warheads to stop unwanted interactions; this makes them cost more to produce.\n\nThe latest HEAT warheads, such as 3BK-31, feature triple charges: the first penetrates the spaced armor, the second the reactive or first layers of armor, and the third one finishes the penetration. The total penetration value may reach up to {{convert|800|mm|in}}.<ref>[http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/ARM/heat/ammo.html Vasiliy Fofanov \u2013 125MM HEAT-FS rounds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105140330/http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/ARM/heat/ammo.html |date=2012-11-05 }} (eng.)</ref>\n\nSome anti-armor weapons incorporate a variant on the shaped charge concept that, depending on the source, can be called an [[explosively formed penetrator]] (EFP), self-forging fragment (SFF), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), [[plate charge]], or [[Misznay-Schardin effect|Misznay Schardin]] (MS) charge. This warhead type uses the interaction of the detonation wave(s), and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of the detonation products, to deform a dish or plate of metal (iron, tantalum, etc.) into a slug-shaped projectile of low length-to-diameter ratio and project this towards the target at around two kilometres per second.\n\nThe SFF is relatively unaffected by first-generation reactive armor, it can also travel more than 1,000 cone diameters (CDs) before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of an SFF normally causes a large diameter, but relatively shallow hole (relative to a shaped charge) or, at best, a few CDs. If the SFF perforates the armor, extensive behind-armor damage (BAD, also called behind-armor effect (BAE)) occurs. The BAD is mainly caused by the high temperature and velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and also overpressure (blast) caused by the impact.\n\nMore modern SFF warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned projectiles, and this in addition to the standard short L to D ratio projectile. The stretched slugs are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAD. Multi-slugs are better at defeating light and/or area targets and the finned projectiles have greatly enhanced accuracy. The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of MBTs\u2014the top, belly and rear armored areas for example. It is well suited for use in the attack of other less heavily armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) and for breaching material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs.\n\nWeapons using the SEFOP principle have already been used in combat; the smart submunitions in the CBU-97 cluster bomb used by the US Air Force and US Navy in the 2003 Iraq war used this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided artillery shells under Project [[SADARM]] (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectiles (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use SFF principle.\n\nWith the effectiveness of gun-fired single charge HEAT rounds being lessened, or even negated by increasingly sophisticated armoring techniques, a class of HEAT rounds termed high-explosive anti-tank multi-purpose, or HEAT-MP, has become more popular. These are HEAT rounds that are effective against older tanks and light armored vehicles but have improved fragmentation, blast and fuzing. This gives the projectiles an overall reasonable light armor and anti-personnel/material effect so that they can be used in place of conventional high-explosive rounds against infantry and other battlefield targets. This reduces the total number of rounds that need to be carried for different roles, which is particularly important for modern tanks like the [[M1 Abrams]], due to the size of their {{convert|120|mm|in}} rounds. The M1A1/M1A2 tank can carry only 40 rounds for its 120&nbsp;mm M256 gun\u2014the [[M60 Patton|M60A3 Patton]] tank (the Abrams' predecessor), carried 63 rounds for its {{convert|105|mm|in}} M68 gun. This effect is reduced by the higher first round hit rate of the Abrams with its improved fire control system compared to the M60. The frequent refueling needed for the Abrams' fuel-hungry turbine also make simultaneous ordnance resupply a marginal burden.\n\n===High-explosive dual-purpose===\n[[File:M430a1.png|thumb|Schematic of a [[40 mm grenade#40\u00d753mm|40\u00d753mm]] M430A1 HEDP grenade|left]] Another variant of HEAT warheads has the warhead surrounded with a conventional fragmentation casing, to allow the warhead to be more effectively used for blast and fragmentation attacks on unarmored targets, whilst remaining effective in the anti-armor role. These are sometimes referred to as high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) warheads. In some cases, this is merely a side effect of the armor-piercing design. In other cases, this dual role ability is a specific part of the design.\n\n== Defense ==\nImprovements to the armor of [[main battle tank]]s have reduced the usefulness of HEAT warheads by making effective man portable HEAT missiles heavier, although many of the world's armies continue to carry man-portable HEAT rocket launchers for use against vehicles and bunkers. In unusual cases, shoulder-launched HEAT rockets are believed to have shot down U.S. helicopters in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aerospacedaily&id=news/veh11203.xml Aviation Week Report]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe reason for the ineffectiveness of HEAT munitions against modern main battle tanks can be attributed in part to the use of new types of armor. The jet created by the explosion of the HEAT round must be a certain distance from the target and must not be deflected. [[Reactive armor]] attempts to defeat this with an outward directed explosion under the impact point, causing the jet to deform and so greatly reducing penetrating power. Alternatively, [[composite armor]] featuring [[ceramic]]s erode the liner jet faster than [[rolled homogeneous armor]] steel, the preferred material in constructing older [[armored fighting vehicle]]s.\n\n[[Spaced armor]] and [[slat armor]] are also designed to defend against HEAT rounds, protecting vehicles by causing premature detonation of the explosive at a relatively safe distance away from the main armor of the vehicle. Some cage defenses work by destroying the mechanism of the HEAT round.\n\n== Deployment ==\nHelicopters have carried anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) tipped with HEAT warheads since 1956. The first example of this was the use of the [[Nord SS.11]] ATGM on the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II]] helicopter by the [[French Armed Forces]]. After then, such weapon systems were widely adopted by other nations.\n\nOn 13 April 1972\u2014during the [[Vietnam War]]\u2014Americans Major Larry McKay, Captain Bill Causey, First Lieutenant Steve Shields, and Chief Warrant Officer Barry McIntyre became the first helicopter crewmen to destroy enemy [[Armored warfare|armor]] in combat. A flight of two [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopters, dispatched from Battery F, [[79th Artillery]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], were armed with the newly developed [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket#US military Warheads|M247]] {{convert|70|mm|in}} HEAT rockets, which were yet untested in the theatre of war. The helicopters destroyed three [[T-54 tank]]s that were about to overrun a U.S. command post. McIntyre and McKay engaged first, destroying the lead tank.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kelley | first = Michael | title = Where we were in Vietnam : a comprehensive guide to the firebases and military installations of the Vietnam war | publisher = L & R Pub | location = New York | year = 2011 | ISBN = 978-1-55571-689-9 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[High-explosive squash head]]\n* [[Kinetic energy penetrator]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Anti-tank rounds]]\n[[Category:Artillery ammunition]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:History of the tank]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|HEAT}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2010}}\n{{lead too short|date=May 2014}}\n}}\n[[File:CumulativeHead.png|thumb|300px|1: Aerodynamic cover; 2: Air-filled cavity; 3: Conical liner; 4: Detonator; 5: Explosive; 6: [[Piezoelectric sensor|Piezo-electric]] trigger]]\n\nA '''high-explosive anti-tank''' ('''HEAT''') '''warhead''' is a type of [[shaped charge]] explosive that uses the [[Munroe effect]] to penetrate thick tank armor. The warhead functions by having the explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity [[superplasticity|superplastic]] jet. This superplastic jet is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD) but is usually used to immobilize or destroy tanks. Due to the way they work, they do not have to be fired as fast as an [[armor piercing shell]], allowing less recoil. Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym HEAT), the jet does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely kinetic in nature. The HEAT warhead has become less effective against tanks and other armored vehicles due to the use of [[composite armor]], [[Reactive armour#Explosive reactive armor|explosive-reactive armor]], and active protection systems which destroy the HEAT warhead before it hits the tank. While HEAT ammunition has become less effective against the composite armor found on MBTs from 1964 onward, indeed, now they pose very little threat to any tank, even from the sides, they are still deadly against lighter vehicles. In addition, air vehicles are also possible targets.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:PIAT projectile diagram.jpg|thumb|upright|Diagram of [[PIAT]] ammunition]] HEAT warheads were developed during [[World War II]], from extensive research and development into [[shaped charge]] warheads. Shaped charge warheads were promoted internationally by the Swiss inventor [[Henry Mohaupt]], who exhibited the weapon before World War II. Before 1939, Mohaupt demonstrated his invention to British and French ordnance authorities. Concurrent development by the German inventor's group of Cranz, [[Schardin]], and Thomanek led to the first documented use of shaped charges in warfare, during the successful assault on the fortress of [[Eben Emael]] on 10 May 1940.\n\nClaims for priority of invention are difficult to resolve due to subsequent historic interpretations, secrecy, espionage, and international commercial interest.<ref>Donald R. Kennedy, ''History of the Shaped Charge Effect, The First 100 Years&nbsp;\u2014 USA \u2013 1983'', Defense Technology Support Services Publication, 1983</ref>\n\nThe first British HEAT weapon to be developed and issued was a [[rifle grenade]] using a {{convert|63.5|mm|in}} cup launcher on the end of the rifle barrel; the [[No 68 AT Grenade|Grenade, Rifle No. 68 /AT]] which was first issued to the [[British Armed Forces]] in the year 1940. This has some claim to have been the first HEAT warhead and launcher in use. The design of the warhead was simple and was capable of penetrating {{convert|52|mm|in}} of armor.<ref name=Eather>R F Eather, BSc & N Griffith, OBE MSc \u2013 ''Some Historical Aspects of the Development of Shaped Charges'' \u2013 Ministry of Defence, Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment \u2013 1984 \u2013 page 6 \u2013 AD-A144 098</ref> The [[fuze]] of the grenade was armed by removing a pin in the tail which prevented the [[firing pin]] from flying forward. Simple fins gave it stability in the air and, provided the grenade hit the target at the proper angle of 90 degrees, the charge would be effective. [[Detonation]] occurred on impact, when a striker in the tail of the grenade overcame the resistance of a creep spring and was thrown forward into a stab [[detonator]].\n\nBy mid-1940, Germany introduced the first HEAT round to be fired by a gun, the 7.5&nbsp;cm Gr.38 Hl/A, (later editions B and C) fired by the KwK.37 L/24 of the [[Panzer IV]] tank and the [[Stug III]] self-propelled gun . In mid-1941, Germany started the production of HEAT rifle-grenades, first issued to [[paratrooper]]s and, by 1942, to the regular army units (''Gewehr-Panzergranate 40'', ''46'' and ''61''), but, just as did the British, soon turned to integrated warhead-delivery systems: In 1943 the ''[[8.8 cm Raketenwerfer 43|P\u00fcppchen]]'', ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' and ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' were introduced.\n\n[[File: Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-671-7483-29, Reichsgebiet, Soldat mit Panzerabwehrwaffe.jpg|left|thumb|The German ''Panzerschreck'' was lethal at close range against armored vehicles]]\nThe ''Panzerfaust'' and ''Panzerschreck'' (tank fist and tank terror, respectively) gave the German infantryman the ability to destroy any tank on the battlefield from 50\u2013150 meters with relative ease of use and training (unlike the British [[PIAT]]). The Germans made use of large quantities of HEAT ammunition in converted [[7.5 cm Pak 97/38]] guns from 1942, also fabricating HEAT warheads for the ''[[Mistel]]'' weapon. These so-called ''Schwere Hohlladung'' (heavy shaped charge) warheads were intended for use against heavily armored [[battleship]]s. Operational versions weighed nearly two tons and were perhaps the largest HEAT warheads ever deployed.<ref name=mistel>http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA497450, A Brief History of Shaped Charges - Defense Technical Information, pg. 9</ref> A five-ton version code-named ''Beethoven'' was also developed.\n \nMeanwhile, the British [[No. 68 AT Grenade|No. 68 AT rifle grenade]] was proving to be too light to deal significant damage, resulting in it rarely being used in action. Due to these limits, a new infantry anti-tank weapon was needed, and this ultimately came in the form of the \"projector, infantry, anti-tank\" or [[PIAT]]. By 1942, the PIAT had been developed by Major [[Millis Jefferis]]. It was a combination of a HEAT warhead with a [[spigot mortar]] delivery system. While cumbersome, the weapon allowed British infantry to engage armor at range for the first time. The earlier magnetic hand-mines and grenades required them to approach dangerously near.<ref>Ian Hogg, ''Grenades and Mortars'' Weapons Book #37, 1974, Ballantine Books</ref> During World War II the British referred to the Monroe effect as the \"cavity effect on explosives\".<ref name=\"The Bazookas Grandfather.\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=4dTRTu6lLsvUgAed8uifDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&q&f=true \"The Bazookas Grandfather.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508112835/https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=4dTRTu6lLsvUgAed8uifDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&q&f=true |date=2016-05-08 }} ''Popular Science'', February 1945, p. 66, 2nd paragraph.</ref>\n\nDuring the war, the French communicated Henry Mohaupt's technology to the U.S. Ordnance Department, and he was invited to the US, where he worked as a consultant on the [[Bazooka]] project.\n\nThe need for a large bore made HEAT rounds relatively ineffective in existing small-caliber anti-tank guns of the era. Germany worked around this with the [[Stielgranate 41]], introducing a round that was placed over the end on the outside of otherwise obsolete {{convert|37|mm|in}} anti-tank guns to produce a medium-range low-velocity weapon.\n\nAdaptations to existing tank guns were somewhat more difficult, although all major forces had done so by the end of the war. Since velocity has little effect on the armor-piercing ability of the round, which is defined by explosive power, HEAT rounds were particularly useful in long-range combat where slower [[terminal velocity]] was not an issue. The Germans were again the ones to produce the most capable gun-fired HEAT rounds, using a [[driving band]] on bearings to allow it to fly unspun from their existing rifled tank guns. The HEAT round was particularly useful to them because it allowed the low-velocity large-bore guns used on their many [[assault gun]]s to also become useful anti-tank weapons.\n\nLikewise, the Germans, Italians, and Japanese had in service many obsolescent ''infantry guns'', short-barreled, low-velocity artillery pieces capable of direct and indirect fire and intended for infantry support, similar in tactical role to [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]; generally an infantry battalion had a battery of four or six. High-explosive anti-tank rounds for these old infantry guns made them semi-useful anti-tank guns, particularly the German {{convert|150|mm|in}} guns (the Japanese 70&nbsp; mm [[Type 92 Battalion Gun|Type 92 battalion gun]] and Italian [[65 mm mountain gun]] also had HEAT rounds available for them by 1944 but they were not very effective).\n\nHigh-explosive anti-tank rounds caused a revolution in anti-tank warfare when they were first introduced in the later stages of World War II. One infantryman could effectively destroy any existing tank with a handheld weapon, thereby dramatically altering the nature of mobile operations. During World War II, weapons using HEAT warheads were termed ''hollow charge'' or ''shape charge'' warheads.<ref name=\"The Bazookas Grandfather.\" />\n\n=== Post war ===\n[[File:125mm BK-14m HEAT.JPG|thumb|Soviet 125&nbsp;mm HEAT BK-14]]\nThe general public remained in the dark about shape charge warheads, even believing that it was a new secret explosive, until early 1945 when the US Army cooperated with the US monthly publication ''[[Popular Science]]'' on a large and detailed article on the subject titled ''It makes steel flow like mud''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=65&query=makes+steel+flow+like+mud|title=\"It makes steel flow like mud\"|work=Popular Science|accessdate=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026194843/http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=65&query=makes+steel+flow+like+mud|archive-date=26 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was this article that revealed to the American public how the fabled Bazooka actually worked against tanks and that the velocity of the rocket was irrelevant.\n\nAfter the war, HEAT rounds became almost universal as the primary anti-tank weapon. Variants of varying effectiveness were produced for almost all weapons from infantry weapons like [[rifle grenade]]s and the [[M203 grenade launcher]], to larger dedicated anti-tank systems like the [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]. When combined with the [[wire-guided missile]], infantry weapons were able to operate at long-ranges also. Anti-tank missiles altered the nature of tank warfare throughout the 1960s and into the 80s, and remain effective.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Effect ===\n[[File: Obus 501556 fh000021.jpg|thumb|Cut-away view of a HEAT round; the copper-lined conical shaped area can be clearly seen]]\n{{further|Munroe effect}}\nThe stream moves at [[hypersonic]] speeds in solid material and therefore erodes exclusively in the contact area of jet and armor material. The correct detonation point of the warhead and spacing is critical for optimum penetration, for two reasons:\n\n# If the HEAT warhead is detonated too near a target's surface, there is not enough time for the particle stream to fully develop. That is why most modern HEAT warheads have what is called a ''standoff'', in the form of an extended nose cap or probe in front of the warhead.<ref group=notes>Both the US TOW and the French-German MILAN wire-guided antitank missiles almost doubled their maximum penetration by the addition of a standoff probe.</ref>\n# The distance is critical because the stream disintegrates and disperses after a short distance, usually well under 2 meters. The stream material is formed by a cone of metal foil lining, usually [[copper]], though [[ductile iron]] and [[tin]] foil was commonly used during [[World War II]].\n\nThe key to the effectiveness of a HEAT round is the diameter of the [[warhead]]. As the penetration continues through the armor, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic ''fist to finger'' penetration, where the size of the eventual ''finger'' is based on the size of the original ''fist''. In general, very early HEAT rounds could expect to penetrate armor of 150% to 250% of their diameters, and these numbers were typical of early weapons used during World War II. Since then, the penetration of HEAT rounds relative to projectile diameters has steadily increased as a result of improved liner material and metal jet performance. Some modern examples claim numbers as high as 700%.<ref>''Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994'', pp. 140\u2013141, addresses the reported \u2248700 mm penetration of the Swedish 106 3A-HEAT-T and Austrian RAT 700 HEAT projectiles for the 106&nbsp; mm M40A1 recoilless rifle.</ref>\n\n=== Stabilization and accuracy ===\n[[File: M113 damage.jpg|thumb|HEAT warhead damage on an [[M113 armored personnel carrier]]]]\nHEAT warheads are less effective if spinning, and grow ever less effective with faster spin. This became a challenge for weapon designers: for a long time, spinning a shell was the most standard method to obtain good accuracy, as with any [[Rifling|rifled]] gun. However, the [[centrifugal force]] of a spinning shell disperses the charged jet. Thus, most hollow charge projectiles are fin-stabilized and not spin-stabilized.<ref name=\"fas\">{{cite web | url =http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/bullets2.htm | title =Big Bullets for Beginners | work =Federation of American Scientists | accessdate =2011-04-24 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110525005338/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/bullets2.htm | archive-date =2011-05-25 | url-status =live | df = }}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, it has become possible to use shaped charges in spin-stabilized projectiles by imparting an opposite spin on the jet so that the two spins cancel out and result in a non-spinning jet. This is done either using [[fluting (firearms)|fluted]] copper liners, which have raised ridges, or by forming the liner in such a way that it has a crystalline structure which imparts spin to the jet.<ref>{{cite conference | conference=12th International Symposium on Ballistics, San Antonio, TX, 30 Oct. - 1 Nov. 1990 | title = Spinning Jets from Shaped Charges with Flow Turned Liners | first = Manfred | last = Held |bibcode=1990ball.sympR....H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Liners%20for%20Shaped%20Charges%20by%20Manfred%20Held%20(2001).pdf | title=Liners for shaped charges | work=Journal of Battlefield Technology | first=Manfred | last=Held | date=November 2001 | volume=4 | number=3 | journal= | access-date=2011-08-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819124810/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Liners%20for%20Shaped%20Charges%20by%20Manfred%20Held%20(2001).pdf | archive-date=2011-08-19 | url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBesides spin-stabilization, another problem with any barreled weapon (that is, a gun) is that a large-diameter shell has worse accuracy than a small-diameter shell of the same weight. The lessening of accuracy increases dramatically with range. Paradoxically, this leads to situations when a [[kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic armor-piercing projectile]] is ''more'' usable at long ranges than a HEAT projectile, despite the latter having a ''higher'' armor penetration. To illustrate this: a stationary Soviet [[T-62]] tank, firing a (smoothbore) cannon at a range of 1000 meters against a target moving 19&nbsp; km/h was rated to have a first-round hit probability of 70% when firing a [[APFSDS|kinetic projectile]]. Under the same conditions, it could expect 25% when firing a HEAT round.<ref>''Jane's Armour and Artillery 1981\u201382'', p. 55.</ref> This affects combat on the open battlefield with long lines of sight; the same T-62 could expect a 70% first-round hit probability using HEAT rounds on target at 500 meters.\n\nA further problem is that, if the warhead is contained inside the barrel, its diameter becomes overly restricted by the [[caliber]] of that barrel. In non-gun applications, when HEAT warheads are delivered with [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, [[bomb]]s, [[grenade]]s, or [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|spigot mortars]], the warhead size is no longer a limiting factor. In these cases, HEAT warheads often seem oversized in relation to the round's body. Classic examples of this include the German [[Panzerfaust]] and Soviet [[RPG-7]].\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:125mm 3BK29 HEAT.JPG|thumb|A Russian 3BK29 HEAT round]]\nMany HEAT-armed missiles today have two (or more) separate warheads (termed a [[tandem charge]]) to be more effective against reactive or multi-layered armor. The first, smaller warhead initiates the reactive armor, while the second (or other), larger warhead penetrates the armor below. This approach requires highly sophisticated fuzing electronics to set off the two warheads the correct time apart, and also special barriers between the warheads to stop unwanted interactions; this makes them cost more to produce.\n\nThe latest HEAT warheads, such as 3BK-31, feature triple charges: the first penetrates the spaced armor, the second the reactive or first layers of armor, and the third one finishes the penetration. The total penetration value may reach up to {{convert|800|mm|in}}.<ref>[http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/ARM/heat/ammo.html Vasiliy Fofanov \u2013 125MM HEAT-FS rounds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105140330/http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/ARM/heat/ammo.html |date=2012-11-05 }} (eng.)</ref>\n\nSome anti-armor weapons incorporate a variant on the shaped charge concept that, depending on the source, can be called an [[explosively formed penetrator]] (EFP), self-forging fragment (SFF), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), [[plate charge]], or [[Misznay-Schardin effect|Misznay Schardin]] (MS) charge. This warhead type uses the interaction of the detonation wave(s), and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of the detonation products, to deform a dish or plate of metal (iron, tantalum, etc.) into a slug-shaped projectile of low length-to-diameter ratio and project this towards the target at around two kilometres per second.\n\nThe SFF is relatively unaffected by first-generation reactive armor, it can also travel more than 1,000 cone diameters (CDs) before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of an SFF normally causes a large diameter, but relatively shallow hole (relative to a shaped charge) or, at best, a few CDs. If the SFF perforates the armor, extensive behind-armor damage (BAD, also called behind-armor effect (BAE)) occurs. The BAD is mainly caused by the high temperature and velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and also overpressure (blast) caused by the impact.\n\nMore modern SFF warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned projectiles, and this in addition to the standard short L to D ratio projectile. The stretched slugs are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAD. Multi-slugs are better at defeating light and/or area targets and the finned projectiles have greatly enhanced accuracy. The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of MBTs\u2014the top, belly and rear armored areas for example. It is well suited for use in the attack of other less heavily armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) and for breaching material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs.\n\nWeapons using the SEFOP principle have already been used in combat; the smart submunitions in the CBU-97 cluster bomb used by the US Air Force and US Navy in the 2003 Iraq war used this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided artillery shells under Project [[SADARM]] (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectiles (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use SFF principle.\n\nWith the effectiveness of gun-fired single charge HEAT rounds being lessened, or even negated by increasingly sophisticated armoring techniques, a class of HEAT rounds termed high-explosive anti-tank multi-purpose, or HEAT-MP, has become more popular. These are HEAT rounds that are effective against older tanks and light armored vehicles but have improved fragmentation, blast and fuzing. This gives the projectiles an overall reasonable light armor and anti-personnel/material effect so that they can be used in place of conventional high-explosive rounds against infantry and other battlefield targets. This reduces the total number of rounds that need to be carried for different roles, which is particularly important for modern tanks like the [[M1 Abrams]], due to the size of their {{convert|120|mm|in}} rounds. The M1A1/M1A2 tank can carry only 40 rounds for its 120&nbsp;mm M256 gun\u2014the [[M60 Patton|M60A3 Patton]] tank (the Abrams' predecessor), carried 63 rounds for its {{convert|105|mm|in}} M68 gun. This effect is reduced by the higher first round hit rate of the Abrams with its improved fire control system compared to the M60. The frequent refueling needed for the Abrams' fuel-hungry turbine also make simultaneous ordnance resupply a marginal burden.\n\n===High-explosive dual-purpose===\n[[File:M430a1.png|thumb|Schematic of a [[40 mm grenade#40\u00d753mm|40\u00d753mm]] M430A1 HEDP grenade|left]] Another variant of HEAT warheads has the warhead surrounded with a conventional fragmentation casing, to allow the warhead to be more effectively used for blast and fragmentation attacks on unarmored targets, whilst remaining effective in the anti-armor role. These are sometimes referred to as high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) warheads. In some cases, this is merely a side effect of the armor-piercing design. In other cases, this dual role ability is a specific part of the design.\n\n== Defense ==\nImprovements to the armor of [[main battle tank]]s have reduced the usefulness of HEAT warheads by making effective man portable HEAT missiles heavier, although many of the world's armies continue to carry man-portable HEAT rocket launchers for use against vehicles and bunkers. In unusual cases, shoulder-launched HEAT rockets are believed to have shot down U.S. helicopters in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aerospacedaily&id=news/veh11203.xml Aviation Week Report]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe reason for the ineffectiveness of HEAT munitions against modern main battle tanks can be attributed in part to the use of new types of armor. The jet created by the explosion of the HEAT round must be a certain distance from the target and must not be deflected. [[Reactive armor]] attempts to defeat this with an outward directed explosion under the impact point, causing the jet to deform and so greatly reducing penetrating power. Alternatively, [[composite armor]] featuring [[ceramic]]s erode the liner jet faster than [[rolled homogeneous armor]] steel, the preferred material in constructing older [[armored fighting vehicle]]s.\n\n[[Spaced armor]] and [[slat armor]] are also designed to defend against HEAT rounds, protecting vehicles by causing premature detonation of the explosive at a relatively safe distance away from the main armor of the vehicle. Some cage defenses work by destroying the mechanism of the HEAT round.\n\n== Deployment ==\nHelicopters have carried anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) tipped with HEAT warheads since 1956. The first example of this was the use of the [[Nord SS.11]] ATGM on the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II]] helicopter by the [[French Armed Forces]]. After then, such weapon systems were widely adopted by other nations.\n\nOn 13 April 1972\u2014during the [[Vietnam War]]\u2014Americans Major Larry McKay, Captain Bill Causey, First Lieutenant Steve Shields, and Chief Warrant Officer Barry McIntyre became the first helicopter crewmen to destroy enemy [[Armored warfare|armor]] in combat. A flight of two [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopters, dispatched from Battery F, [[79th Artillery]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], were armed with the newly developed [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket#US military Warheads|M247]] {{convert|70|mm|in}} HEAT rockets, which were yet untested in the theatre of war. The helicopters destroyed three [[T-54 tank]]s that were about to overrun a U.S. command post. McIntyre and McKay engaged first, destroying the lead tank.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kelley | first = Michael | title = Where we were in Vietnam : a comprehensive guide to the firebases and military installations of the Vietnam war | publisher = L & R Pub | location = New York | year = 2011 | ISBN = 978-1-55571-689-9 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[High-explosive squash head]]\n* [[Kinetic energy penetrator]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Anti-tank rounds]]\n[[Category:Artillery ammunition]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:History of the tank]]\n", "name_user": "BobMcGeoff", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a phrase for flow", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_anti-tank_warhead"}

{"title_page": "Peter Greig-Smith", "text_new": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988. Past Presidents gathered for a team photograph: Back row, left to right: A.D. Bradshaw, R.J. Berry, '''Peter Greig-Smith''', A. Macfadyen, C.H. Gimingham, G. Dunnet, L.R.Taylor. Front row from left: C.H. Evans; P.R. Richards, J. Harley, R. Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the Journal of Ecology, the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: John T. Curtis and Robert H. Whittaker in the United States, and David W. Goodall and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with J. Roger Bray, developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective.

Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b. ''Potamolejeunea Holtii'' (spruce) nov.comb. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 1(2): 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948c.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

''Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 36(2): 132\u2013136.</ref>, dealt with the formation of tussocks in ''Ammophila arenaria'' and included detailed observations on the clumped distribution of tillers, which form tussock-like clumps in older, fixed dunes but are regularly distributed in the younger, moving dunes. After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1953. A note on the behaviour of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L.) Link, in relation to sand-dune formation.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J. Chadwick. 1965. Data on pattern within plant communities: III. ''Acacia-Capparis'' semi-desert scrub in the Sudan. ''Journal of Ecology'' 53(2): 465\u2013474.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1991.

The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. ''Annals of Botany'' 16(2): 293\u2013316.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1961.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>rl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. Tim Allen, a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201cThere may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views.\u201d Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988.

Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the Journal of Ecology, the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: John T. Curtis and Robert H. Whittaker in the United States, and David W. Goodall and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with J. Roger Bray, developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor, and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note.

''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>rl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. Tim Allen, a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201cThere may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views.\u201d Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries. [https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/Tewolde_Darwin_Lecture2002.pdf Tewolde B. G. Egziabher]<ref>Egziabher, Tewolde Berhan Gebre. 2002.

Available online at <nowiki>https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/Tewolde_Darwin_Lecture2002.pdf</nowiki>).</ref> describes in eloquent and grateful terms his arrival from Ethiopia to Greig-Smith\u2019s lab in Bangor.\n\nGreig-Smith maintained a lifelong interest in tropical ecology. He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Eezcurra", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor edit (eliminated a redundant comma) in caption for Figure 2", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Greig-Smith"}

Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities up through 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn and in the Roman Forum, as well as a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. The Roman festival of [[Sol_Invictus#Festival_of_Dies_Natalis_Solis_Invicti|Natalis Solis Invicti]] has also been suggested, since it was celebrated on December 25th and was associated with some prominent emperors.<ref name=\"MacMullen1997\">Bishop Jacob Bar-Salabi (cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)</ref>  It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399 |title=Library : History & Origin: Feast of the Nativity |website=www.catholicculture.org}}</ref>\n\nAlternately, December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice because of its symbolic theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with longer hours of sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus \"He must increase, I must decrease.\" {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25 |title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers |website=www.catholic.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast (now called [[Easter]]) and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Eastern Churches on 6 January.<ref>''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Esp\u00edn, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237</ref> The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.<ref>''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400\u2013401</ref>\n\nThe earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely a book by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written in the early 3rd century. He based his view on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring equinox]] which Hippolytus placed on 25 March, and then added nine months to calculate the date of birth. That date was then used for the Christmas celebration.<ref>''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142</ref> 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since many people of that era held the belief that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense mentioned in {{bibleverse|Luke|1:8\u201311|KJV}} refers to the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.<ref>Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72</ref>\n\nLastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the [[Hanukkah|Feast of Dedication]], which occurs on 25 Kislev of the [[Jewish calendar]].  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Adoration of the shepherds]]\n* [[Anno Domini]]\n* [[Ante Christum Natum]]\n* [[Baptism of Jesus]]\n* [[Christ myth theory]]\n* [[Chronology of Jesus]]\n* [[Common Era]]\n* [[Detailed Christian timeline]]\n* [[Dionysius Exiguus]]\n* [[Gospel harmony]]\n* [[Historical Jesus]]\n* [[Historicity of Jesus]]\n* [[Jesus in Christianity]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[Timeline of the Bible]]\n* [[Venerable Bede]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AKRzBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&dq=%22Scripture+is+without+error+or+fault+in+all+its+teaching%22#v=onepage&q=%22Scripture%20is%20without%20error%20or%20fault%20in%20all%20its%20teaching%22&f=false |title=A High View of Scripture? |last=Allert |first=Craig D. |publisher=Baker Books |year=2007 |isbn=9780801027789 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |last=Blomberg |first=C.E. |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1995 |isbn=9780802837844 |editor-last=Bromiley |editor-first=Geoffrey W. |volume=4 |chapter=Quirinius |ref=harv |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&pg=PA12&dq=%22governor+of+Syria+when+Jesus+was+born%22#v=onepage&q=%22governor%20of%20Syria%20when%20Jesus%20was%20born%22&f=false}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Lord or Legend? |last=Boyd |first=Gregory A. |last2=Eddy |first2=Paul Rhodes |publisher=Baker Books |year=2007 |location=Grand Rapids |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |title=The Birth of the Messiah: A Commentary on the Infancy Narratives in Matthew and Luke |last=Brown |first=R.E. |publisher=Doubleday & Company |year=1977 |isbn=9780385059077 |author-link=Raymond E.

Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities up through 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn and in the Roman Forum, as well as a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. The Roman festival of [[Sol_Invictus#Festival_of_Dies_Natalis_Solis_Invicti|Natalis Solis Invicti]] has also been suggested, since it was celebrated on December 25th and was associated with some prominent emperors.<ref name=\"MacMullen1997\">Bishop Jacob Bar-Salabi (cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)</ref>  It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399 |title=Library : History & Origin: Feast of the Nativity |website=www.catholicculture.org}}</ref>\n\nAlternately, December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice because of its symbolic theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with longer hours of sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus \"He must increase, I must decrease.\" {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25 |title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers |website=www.catholic.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast (now called [[Easter]]) and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Eastern Churches on 6 January.<ref>''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Esp\u00edn, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237</ref> The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.<ref>''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400\u2013401</ref>\n\nThe earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely a book by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written in the early 3rd century. He based his view on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring equinox]] which Hippolytus placed on 25 March, and then added nine months to calculate the date of birth. That date was then used for the Christmas celebration.<ref>''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142</ref> 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since many people of that era held the belief that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense mentioned in {{bibleverse|Luke|1:8\u201311|KJV}} refers to the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.<ref>Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72</ref>\n\nLastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the [[Hanukkah|Feast of Dedication]], which occurs on 25 Kislev of the [[Jewish calendar]].  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Adoration of the shepherds]]\n* [[Anno Domini]]\n* [[Ante Christum Natum]]\n* [[Baptism of Jesus]]\n* [[Christ myth theory]]\n* [[Chronology of Jesus]]\n* [[Common Era]]\n* [[Detailed Christian timeline]]\n* [[Dionysius Exiguus]]\n* [[Gospel harmony]]\n* [[Historical Jesus]]\n* [[Historicity of Jesus]]\n* [[Jesus in Christianity]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[Timeline of the Bible]]\n* [[Venerable Bede]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AKRzBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&dq=%22Scripture+is+without+error+or+fault+in+all+its+teaching%22#v=onepage&q=%22Scripture%20is%20without%20error%20or%20fault%20in%20all%20its%20teaching%22&f=false |title=A High View of Scripture? |last=Allert |first=Craig D. |publisher=Baker Books |year=2007 |isbn=9780801027789 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |last=Blomberg |first=C.E. |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1995 |isbn=9780802837844 |editor-last=Bromiley |editor-first=Geoffrey W. |volume=4 |chapter=Quirinius |ref=harv |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&pg=PA12&dq=%22governor+of+Syria+when+Jesus+was+born%22#v=onepage&q=%22governor%20of%20Syria%20when%20Jesus%20was%20born%22&f=false}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Lord or Legend? |last=Boyd |first=Gregory A. |last2=Eddy |first2=Paul Rhodes |publisher=Baker Books |year=2007 |location=Grand Rapids |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |title=The Birth of the Messiah: A Commentary on the Infancy Narratives in Matthew and Luke |last=Brown |first=R.E. |publisher=Doubleday & Company |year=1977 |isbn=9780385059077 |author-link=Raymond E.
