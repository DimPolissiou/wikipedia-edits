WBZ is heavily involved in charitable work, including its annual Christmastime fund drive for the [[Boston Children's Hospital]], which it does along with TV station [[WBZ-TV]].\n\n==History==\nIn November 1920, the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company]] established its first broadcasting station, [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], located in its plant in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The station was set up to promote the sale of Westinghouse radio receivers.  This initial station proved successful, so in 1921 the company expanded its activities by building three additional stations, beginning with WBZ, and followed by [[WABC (AM)|WJZ]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]] (now WABC in New York City) and [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], originally in [[Chicago]], and now in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===1921\u20131931: Springfield===\nOn September 15, 1921, Westinghouse was issued a Limited Commercial license<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WBZ_-_first_licence_-_September_15,_1921.pdf First WBZ license (issued September 15, 1921)] Limited Commercial license, serial #224, issued to the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Springfield, Massachusetts for a three month period.

A small number of stations were already providing regularly scheduled entertainment broadcasts, most of which operated under Amateur or Experimental licenses. (A prime example was the American Radio & Research Corporation's experimental station, 1XE in [[Medford, Massachusetts#Neighborhoods|Medford Hillside, Massachusetts]] near Boston, which was relicensed in early 1922 as [[WGI (radio station)|WGI]].) Effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. government formally established regulations to define a broadcasting station, by setting aside two wavelengths \u2014 360 meters for entertainment, and 485 meters (619&nbsp;kHz) for official weather and other government reports \u2014 and requiring the stations to hold a Limited Commercial license.<ref name=\"regs\">[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066705633&view=1up&seq=200  \"Miscellaneous: Amendments to Regulations\"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', January 3, 1922, page 10. Limited Commercial licenses had been issued since the government had begun licensing stations in 1912. \"Broadcasting\" was added as one of the available service categories, and not all Limited Commercial stations were authorized to make broadcasts intended for the general public.</ref>\n\nWBZ was one of a handful of stations which already met the new standard, and in fact its initial license had been the first Limited Commercial license that had specified broadcasting on the 360-meter wavelength that would be formally designated by the December 1st regulations. By some interpretations, this made WBZ America's first broadcasting station, and in 1923 the Department of Commerce, referring to WBZ, stated that \"The first broadcasting license was issued in September, 1921\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mbZPX070GUsC&pg=RA1-PA221&lpg=RA1-PA221#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Bureau of Navigation: Radio Communication\"], ''Report of the Secretary of Commerce'', July 1, 1923, page 221.</ref> However, WBZ's priority is not widely recognized,<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002666587&view=1up&seq=255 \"Sec. 122.

WBZ is heavily involved in charitable work, including its annual Christmastime fund drive for the [[Boston Children's Hospital]], which it does along with TV station [[WBZ-TV]].\n\n==History==\nIn November 1920, the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company]] established its first broadcasting station, [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], located in its plant in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The station was set up to promote the sale of Westinghouse radio receivers.  This initial station proved successful, so in 1921 the company expanded its activities by building three additional stations, beginning with WBZ, and followed by [[WABC (AM)|WJZ]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]] (now WABC in New York City) and [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], originally in [[Chicago]], and now in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===1921\u20131931: Springfield===\nOn September 15, 1921, Westinghouse was issued a Limited Commercial license<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WBZ_-_first_licence_-_September_15,_1921.pdf First WBZ license (issued September 15, 1921)] Limited Commercial license, serial #224, issued to the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Springfield, Massachusetts for a three month period.

A small number of stations were already providing regularly scheduled entertainment broadcasts, most of which operated under Amateur or Experimental licenses. (A prime example was the American Radio & Research Corporation's experimental station, 1XE in [[Medford, Massachusetts#Neighborhoods|Medford Hillside, Massachusetts]] near Boston, which was relicensed in early 1922 as [[WGI (radio station)|WGI]].) Effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. government formally established regulations to define a broadcasting station, by setting aside two wavelengths \u2014 360 meters for entertainment, and 485 meters (619&nbsp;kHz) for official weather and other government reports \u2014 and requiring the stations to hold a Limited Commercial license.<ref name=\"regs\">[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066705633&view=1up&seq=200  \"Miscellaneous: Amendments to Regulations\"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', January 3, 1922, page 10. Limited Commercial licenses had been issued since the government had begun licensing stations in 1912. \"Broadcasting\" was added as one of the available service categories, and not all Limited Commercial stations were authorized to make broadcasts intended for the general public.</ref>\n\nWBZ was one of a handful of stations which already met the new standard, and in fact its initial license had been the first Limited Commercial license that had specified broadcasting on the 360-meter wavelength that would be formally designated by the December 1st regulations. By some interpretations, this made WBZ America's first broadcasting station, and in 1923 the Department of Commerce, referring to WBZ, stated that \"The first broadcasting license was issued in September, 1921\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mbZPX070GUsC&pg=RA1-PA221&lpg=RA1-PA221#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Bureau of Navigation: Radio Communication\"], ''Report of the Secretary of Commerce'', July 1, 1923, page 221.</ref> However, WBZ's priority is not widely recognized,<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002666587&view=1up&seq=255 \"Sec. 122.

This left Brookins with a fractured skull, broke his nose, and knocked out a few teeth. The attack came after Brookins had given a series of speeches denouncing squirrels in Chicago saying \"It's a pet peeve. It does invoke some giggles. But we are spending too much money on replacing garbage carts because the squirrels continue to eat through 'em,\" and \"I get calls [with residents saying], 'I need a new garbage can.' I just gave you a garbage can. [And the caller says], 'Well, the squirrels ate through it in two days and nobody wants trash throughout the community. So they keep asking us for garbage cans.\" A survey found that 11% of the cities garbage carts are damaged, costing $300,000 in repairs. At least some of that damage does come from squirrels. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/alderman-says-aggressive-squirrels-eating-through-garbage-carts/|title=Alderman says 'aggressive squirrels' eating through garbage carts|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/22/suicide-bomber-squirrel-hospitalizes-chicago-politician-who-spoke-out-against-squirrels/|title='Suicide bomber' squirrel hospitalizes Chicago politician who spoke out against squirrels|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chicagoinc/ct-brookins-squirrels-1122-chicago-inc-20161121-story.html|title=Kamikaze squirrel gets revenge on Ald.

Rush of Chicago's Second Congressional District, but Brookins later withdrew his petitions when Rush ultimately filed to keep his seat, on December 4, 2017.  But three days later, on December 7, 2017, Brookins announced his intent to \"leave public service\" by circulating petitions to fill a vacancy on the Circuit Court of Cook County when the Illinois Courts Commission forced former-judge Valarie Turner into retirement.  On January 30, 2018, the Cook County Electoral Board removed Brookins from the ballot for that judicial vacancy after it was determined that Brookins was between 250 to 398 short of the required signatures to get on the ballot.<ref>chicagotribunecloutstreetJanuary30,2018</ref>\n\nIn the runoff of the [[2019 Chicago mayoral election]], Brookins endorsed [[Toni Preckwinkle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/chicago-mayor-race-endorsements-507305521.html |title=List of Endorsements in the Race for Chicago Mayor |publisher=NBC Chicago |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBrookins is married to Ebony Taylor-Brookins.
