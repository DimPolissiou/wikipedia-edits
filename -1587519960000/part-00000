In 1959, U.S. Special Operations Forces (Military and CIA) began to train some Laotian soldiers in unconventional warfare techniques as early as the fall of 1959 under the code name \"Erawan\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the war in Southeast Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Under this code name, General [[Vang Pao]], who served the royal Lao family, recruited and trained his Hmong soldiers. The Hmong were targeted as allies after President [[John F. Kennedy]], who refused to send more American soldiers to battle in Southeast Asia, took office. Instead, he called the CIA to use its tribal forces in Laos and \"make every possible effort to launch guerrilla operations in North Vietnam with its Asian recruits.\" General Vang Pao then recruited and trained his Hmong soldiers to ally with the CIA and fight against North Vietnam.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf|title=Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos 1961-1973|last=Ahern|first=Thomas L.

The CIA organized the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] tribe to fight against the North Vietnamese-backed [[Pathet Lao]]. The [[Pathet Lao]] were the communists in [[Laos]]. The CIA-backed Hmong guerrillas used [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] to \"drop 46 million pounds of foodstuffs....transport tens of thousands of troops, conduct a highly successful photo-reconnaissance program, and engage in numerous clandestine missions using night-vision glasses and state-of-the-art electronic equipment.\"<ref name=\"Leary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art7.html|title=CIA Air Operations in Laos, 1955-1974|last=Leary|first=William M.|year=2008|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 16, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This was the largest paramilitary operation in which the CIA participated, spanning 13 years until the [[Afghanistan War]]. The CIA was responsible for directing natives of Laos to fight the North Vietnamese. Although such efforts were ended at the signing the [[Paris Peace Accords]], the CIA believed it a success as it managed to fight the enemy to a standstill and combat the communist threat.<ref name=\"Leary\" /> They saw it as a victory and as an accomplishment. The director at the time, Richard Helms, called it superb and discussed the amount of manpower required, and that the CIA did a good job in supplying it.\n\nAlong with its humanitarian efforts, the CIA also conducted a massive bombing effort in Laos from 1964-1973. 580,000 bombing missions took place over the nine-year campaign, but it is not known how many of them were dropped by the [[United States Air Force]] and how many were dropped by the CIA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNwi90uUNDA|title=YouTube|last=Eberle|first=Marc|date=February 9, 2015|website=The Most Secret Place on Earth: The CIA's Covert War in Laos|publisher=|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> For the CIA, this was the largest paramilitary operation they had to date. By the summer of 1970 the CIA owned airline Air America had two dozen twin-engine transports, two dozen STOL aircraft and 30 helicopters dedicated to the operations in Laos. This airline employed more than 300 pilots, copilots, flight mechanics, and airfreight specialists flying out of Laos and Thailand.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Although the bombing campaign was eventually disclosed to the American public formally in 1969, stories about the Laos bombing effort were published prior to that in ''The New York Times''.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Even after the United States government made the war public, the American people were in the dark as to how large scale the bombing campaign was.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Politics of Laos and the CIA===\nA 1962 ''Time Magazine'' article about [[Laos]] makes some points that help illustrate the context of the overt and covert actions of all sides in Laos before the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\">{{cite journal\n | title =LAOS: Four Phases to Nonexistence\n | date = June 8, 1962\n | journal = Time\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896299-1,00.html\n}}</ref> One of the first points the article makes is that a Laotian national identity, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, was a rare thing (since Laos had been a territory of [[Thailand]] and part of the vast French-controlled Indochina for generations). [[Communist]] groups and those from outside, including the French colonial administration and the CIA, often exploited power vacuums that existed within the region.\n\n\"Though it has a king, a government and an army and can be found on a map, Laos does not really exist. Many of its estimated 2,000,000 people would be astonished to be called Laotians since they know themselves to be Meo or Black Thai or Khalom tribesmen among other small ethnic groups that resided in the countryside. It is a land without a railroad, a single paved highway or a newspaper. Its chief cash crop was opium.\"\n\nLaos was dreamed up by French Diplomat Jean Chauvel, who in 1946 was France's Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs. At the time, post World War II France was trying to reassert its authority over its colonies in Indo-China. The rebellious inhabitants had no desire to return to their prewar status as colonial subjects. In place of original Indo-China, consisting of various kingdoms and principalities, Paris put together three new autonomous states within the French Union: Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos. Drawing lines on a map, Chauvel created Laos by merging the rival kingdoms of Luangprabang, whose monarch became King of Laos, with Champassak, whose pretender was consoled by being made permanent Inspector General of the new state.\n\nFrench influence did not survive long after the 1954 defeat at [[Dien Bien Phu]]. When the French declared Laos independent, it did not have a cohesive government: two Laotian provinces were run by the communist Pathet Lao under Prince [[Souphanouvong]]. His half-brother, Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], was chosen as Premier in 1956, and Souphanouvong and his provinces were put underneath the fledgling central government. A subsequent national election increased communist strength in the National Assembly to nine of the 21 seats, which aroused the ire of the U.S. government, which distrusted Souvanna Phouma, \"both as a neutralist and a compromise with the Reds.\"<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\" /> Regime change to the [[right-wing]] General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] came not from a coup, but from stopping U.S. economic aid, which was the responsibility, subordinate to the White House, of the U.S. [[Agency for International Development]]. The new dictator invited U.S. military advisors, who came with both [[U.S. Defense Department]] and CIA personnel.\n\n===CIA operations in Laos, proprietary airlines===\nAccording to [[William M. Leary]], a historian at the University of Georgia who analyzed Laotian operations for the CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence, CIA-led covert action in Laos was the largest paramilitary operation in the history of the Agency.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nIn 1950, the CIA\u2014supporting but not directing covert action until 1952\u2014determined that it could best meet its support responsibilities with a proprietary airline under its private control. \"In August 1950, the Agency secretly purchased the assets of Civil Air Transport (CAT), an airline that had been started in China after World War II by Gen. Claire L. Chennault and Whiting Willauer. CAT would continue to fly commercial routes throughout Asia, acting in every way as a privately owned commercial airline. At the same time, under the corporate guise of CAT Incorporated, it provided airplanes and crews for secret intelligence operations. During the [[Korean War]], for example, it made more than 100 hazardous overflights of mainland China, airdropping agents and supplies.\"<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n====Allegations of CIA drug trafficking====\n{{main|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking}}\n\nAs a Ph.D. candidate in [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] at [[Yale University]], [[Alfred W.

He stated that his two decades of research found Air America not involved in drug trafficking. Nonetheless, McCoy finds the CIA culpable in drug-trafficking on the part of the Laotians. According to Leary, \"The CIA's main focus in Laos remained on fighting the war, not on policing the drug trade.\"<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n==Laos 1953==\nIn April 1953, the French had established a leading military base at Dien Bien Phu, based deep in a mountain basin in Tonkin Province remote northwestern Vietnam. The base was designed to block communist supply lines in neighboring Laos. The base would also be a tantalizing target for the Viet Minh attacks that the French could readily defend with their superior firepower. Unfortunately, the communist foes besieged the base and five other separate firebases which facilitated to the French colonial forces in Indochina requesting U.S. air transport \"to fly tanks and heavy equipment to their hard-pressed forces in Laos. \"Having such equipment,\" the French emphasized, \"might mean the difference between holding and losing Laos.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nAt this point, the CAT role evolved from clandestine to covert. The Eisenhower Administration, unwilling to give overt support, decided to use CAT to fulfill the French request, in Operation SQUAW. The U.S. Air Force provided CAT with \"sterile\" (i.e., with American military identification removed) [[C-119]] transports, capable of carrying the heavy loads required by the French. CAT personnel was unfamiliar with the C-119, and the Air Force held a short but intense training course for them at [[Clark Air Force Base]] in the Philippines. On May 5, they flew six of the transports, repainted with French insignia, to [[Gia Lam]] airbase, outside [[Hanoi]], and parachuted supplies and equipment to French forces in Laos until July 16 with CAT pilots making numerous airdrops to French troops in Laos.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n==Laos (and Vietnam) 1954==\nAgain, the French asked for help in supporting their isolated base at [[Dien Bien Phu]]. CAT, contracting with the French in January 1954 to provide 24 pilots to fly 12 C-119 aircraft, agreed to maintenance under USAF ground crews at Hanoi's Cat Bi airfield in support of Dien Bien Phu. Flights started in March, as the [[Viet Minh]] began their assault, and continued until Dien Bien Phu fell on May 7. Two CAT pilots died and one other wounded.\n\nCAT operations continued after the fall of Dien Bien Phu. The C-119s supported isolated French outposts, and CAT also provided 12 [[C-46]] transports to evacuate civilians from North to South Vietnam. CAT also carried members of the CIA's Saigon Military Mission<ref name=\"PPv1D95\">{{cite web\n | title = Document 95, Lansdale Team's Report on Covert Saigon Mission in 1954 and 1955 \n | work = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 1\n | pages = 573\u201383\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/doc95.htm\n}}</ref> (see [[#Vietnam 1954|Vietnam 1954]]) north of the 17th parallel, in a futile attempt to set up [[stay-behind]] networks. Laos was declared neutral but due to its location, it effectively functioned as a microcosm of the war. Per the [[Domino theory]], the United States proclaimed Laos a buffer state due to it bordering North Vietnam and China.\n\n==Laos 1955==\nIn January 1955, the U.S. created the United States Operations Mission (USOM) in [[Vientiane]], Laos, to provide foreign aid. By the end of the year, a [[Programs Evaluation Office]] (PEO), staffed by retired military personnel or military officers, quietly delegated leadership to the CIA. The PEO was a covert equivalent to a [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] (MAAG), organized within USOM to handle military aid, though not usually within the scope of USOM. The CIA was involved with the PEO until US military involvement was acknowledged and a MAAG established.\n\n<blockquote>In July 1955, USOM officials learned that a rice failure threatened famine in several provinces in Laos. Because a number of these areas were in remote, mountainous regions, airdrops proved the only feasible means to delivering essential supplies of rice and salt. Three CAT C-46s arrived at the northeastern railhead of [[Udon Thani]], [[Thailand]] on September 11 to begin the airlift. By the end of the month, CAT had flown more than 200 missions to 25 reception areas having delivered 1,000 tons of emergency food. This airdrop relief operation, conducted with smooth efficiency, marked the beginning of CAT's--and later Air America's--support of U.S. assistance programs in Laos.<ref name=\"Leary\" />></blockquote>\n\n==Laos 1957==\nA new CAT contract was signed in 1957, and Bruce Blevins flew a [[C-47]] to Vientiane in the service of the U.S. Embassy. When he flew elsewhere in the country, conditions were technologically underdeveloped. Vientiane had the only control tower, radio navigational aid, and non-dirt runway in Laos. The U.S., again through covert means, increased its level of support.\n\nFurthermore, a 1957 cable from American intelligence officials in Laos to Washington noted the inability for the Communist Pathet Lao (PL) and Royal Laotian Guard (RLG) to come to a peaceful resolution. The cable stated that in late 1957, agreements were signed between the two groups to cease civil conflict. While the deal was also intended to result in the assimilation of the PL into larger Laotian society, the CIA had gathered intelligence implying that the PL had not meant to abandon its \"radical\" ideology and desire to overthrow the democratic government headed by the RLG. Instead, the CIA believed that the PL desired to establish a Communist government via subversive political and covert actions as opposed to overt military operations. Nevertheless, the CIA feared that the PL was more than willing to revert to the use of force if their new tactics proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe following cable demonstrates this type of subversion: \"PL propagandists and terrorists continued to visit the villages telling the villagers to refuse to obey RLG officials, and that the PL would soon take overall power and punish those who opposed them, and that the refusal of the people to support the PL would mean a renewal of the civil war.\"<ref>\"Transmittal of Study of Communist Subversion in Laos.\" https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000900210003-6.pdf</ref> As a result, the return of the two provinces to the RLG had been nullified and the PL continued to rule the provinces except places occupied by Lao National Army.\n\n==Laos 1958==\nIn an October 1958 memorandum, the CIA acknowledged that the agency had been handed the responsibility to oversee covert operations within Laos. The State Department recognized the CIA's covert operations and suggested the development of overt operations. Additionally, the State Department outlined a document that covered all hypothetical situations in Chile and hinted that the CIA might consider taking action for one of those hypothetical operations. The memorandum requested the chief of the Far East Division to consider the role of the CIA in Laos and how valid their suggestions for operations were. This memorandum revealed that there existed a well-thought-out plot that took into account Laotian concerns and U.S. interests in Laos and not merely a simple military reaction. However, the actual plans were redacted from the document as well as the names of those involved. Though this could suggest the planning of something more wicked, it could also be a diplomatic choice in not angering a nation long after the fact that certain considerations were never acted upon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hypothetical Situation in Laos|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00036R001100190007-2.pdf|website=CIA Reading Room|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the civil war grew in intensity, CAT C-47s and C-46s passed with ever greater frequency over Vientiane to fulfill urgent airdrop requests. Blevins was also kept busy, landing throughout the country and making numerous airdrops to isolated FAR posts. He developed an especially close relationship with a CIA case officer who had arrived in October 1958 and who was assigned to support neutralist Capt. [[Kong Le]]'s parachute battalion, a Laotian officer who would rise to the highest ranks.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n==Laos 1959==\n\nVictor B. Anthony and Richard R. Sexton, two Air Force historians, prepared a 400-page document called ''The War in Northern Laos, 1954-1973'', based on two separate manuscripts. In this document, it shows that as early as 1959, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had conceived a plan for U.S. military intervention in Laos, two years earlier than previously thought. In fall 1959, the U.S. Special Forces initiated training a number of Laotian soldiers in unconventional warfare tactics under the codename Erawan.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\">{{cite web|last1=National Security Archive|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|website=The National Security Archive|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref> This development occurred due to the US being unable to integrate the Pathet Lao communist army with the royal army.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu}}</ref> Air America\u2014the name changed on March 26, 1959, primarily to avoid confusion about the air proprietary's operations in Japan 16\u2014provided essential transportation for the expanding American effort in Laos.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nSince the Laotian government wanted U.S. assistance to remain secret in the [[Laotian Civil War]] against the [[Pathet Lao]], the CIA established a unit from the [[United States Army Special Forces]] who arrived on the CIA proprietary airline Air America, wearing civilian clothes and having no obvious U.S. connection. These soldiers led [[Miao people|Meo]] and [[Hmong people#The \"Secret War\"|Hmong]] tribesmen against Communist forces. The covert program was called [[Operation White Star|Operation Hotfoot]].

Twelve Mobile Training Teams took up duties in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Pakse. CIA officials in Laos had requested additional air transport resources. The CIA, in August 1959, directed CIA proprietary Air America to train two helicopter pilots. Further, Air America directed search and rescue missions in Laos in addition to its role in combat operations.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> Originally posted as a short-term requirement, this operation served as the beginning of a significant rotary-wing operation in Laos. Vang Pao expressed concerns that the Hmong were likely to suffer reprisals from communists. With assistance from a U.S. Special Forces team, he began to organize a Hmong stay-behind force. Declassified documents from 2008 also revealed that the U.S. ambassador in Laos at the time served as the field commander of the so-called \"secret war\" there.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOutside of just training locals, previously secret U.S. Air Force official histories of the Vietnam war were published in April 2008 by the National Security Archive which disclosed for the first time that Central Intelligence Agency contract employees had a direct role in combat air attacks when they flew Laotian government aircraft on strike missions. Additionally, the Air Force actively considered nuclear weapons options during the 1959 Laos crisis.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBy December 1959, Vang Pao had to either fight the communists or leave the country. If the United States supplied the weapons, Vang Pao claimed that he would fight and raise an army of 10,000.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nThis aforementioned activity in 1959 was caused by an inability to integrate the Pathet Lao communist military into the Royal Lao Armed forces, precipitating a civil war in which the CIA ordered the Air Force to deploy a squadron of B-47 bombers to the Clark Air Force Base. This deployment ensured that the bomber could be used to interfere or destroy Pathet Lao communications to the North Vietnamese.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Laos 1960==\nFrom 1960 to 1961, the CIA initiated operations code-named Erawan in which U.S. Special Forces trained Laotian soldiers in methods of unconventional warfare used the enemy.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\"/> The previous training of the Laotian military was underdeveloped and had \u201ccaused friction between the Americans and the French.\u201d After a request from Phoumi in February, Washington decided to extend training programs for the Laotian military. However, negotiations over the nature and structure of the training programs created divisions between the French, Washington, and Phoumi. The French wanted to retain complete control over the Laotian Army, but Phoumi objected. Phoumi asserted his desire to have the French completely removed from Laos. He also voiced sentiments advocating for the U.S. Special Forces to control the training operations. The French voiced objections to U.S. presence in Laos stating that such intervention violated the Geneva accords, a position supported by Souvanna Phouma. After a long series of negotiations combined with interventions from the Royal Thailand Government, U.S. Special Forces infiltrated the Lao countryside and began training Laotians in unconventional warfare and anti-guerilla tactics.\n\nEventually, four CAT pilots were trained on U.S. Air Force H-19A helicopters in Japan and the Philippines. The CAT contingent did not reach Laos until March 1960. Due to the operating limitations of the H-19s, the underpowered helicopters could fly only at lower elevations in the country. \"Generally, they were used to carry CIA case officers to meetings in outlying areas and to distribute leaflets during elections. By June 1960, it had become clear that helicopters would form a permanent part of Air America's operations in Laos.\"<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nAir America hired four experienced U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilots who obtained their discharges in Okinawa to fly the H-19s. Later in the year, the CIA arranged for the Marine Corps to transfer four UH-34 helicopters to Air America to replace the H-19s.\n\nAlso in 1960, a national election was held of dubious integrity. \"Phoumi's group gained a sweeping majority. On the surface, a relatively tough U.S. policy of containing Communism seemed to be an overwhelming success... $250 million in U.S. economic and military aid had too powerful an effect on the Laotian government, which was soon reeling with corruption. Promised reforms never materialized, and practically no funds reached the peasants and forest tribes. The Communist Pathet Lao guerrilla bands began raiding in the north. Red Prince Souphanouvong not only walked out of jail but took most of his prison guards with him.\"<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\" />\n\nIn August 1960, Kong Le, who had formed a friendship with a CIA officer in 1958, still returned neutralist Souvanna Phouma to power with a military coup. Phoumi Nosavan, who had much closer CIA relations, took refuge in his base in Savannakhet, in southern Laos.\n\nThe U.S. encouraged Phoumi Nosavan, in December, to attack Kong Le's battalion in Vientiane.\n\n<blockquote> Kong Le retreated to the strategic Plaine des Jarres, joining forces with the Pathet Lao. The Soviet Union poured in supplies by air, and Communist North Vietnam contributed tough guerrilla cadres. When Phoumi's army advanced, it was badly beaten in a series of noisy but largely bloodless battles. Phoumi got some breathing space when, in the spring of 1961, the government eagerly agreed to a ceasefire.<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\" /></blockquote>\n\nFrom 1960 to 1975 The CIA ran a clandestine sideshow to the Vietnam war in Laos. Long Cheng was a secret air base built by the CIA during the Vietnam war. This base was so secretive that not even Congress was aware of its existence. Long Cheng was unmarked, un-mapped and known only by a select few. It became the CIA Headquarter during the Vietnam war and was so active that more than four hundred flights flew to and from Long Cheng on a daily basis. The secret operations in Laos grew into the largest CIA operation in history. Laos was used as a pawn for its strategic positioning between its neighboring countries from which the United States could launch military attacks. Laos has been reported as the most intensely bombed country in the history of Air Strike War. More bombs were dropped in the \"Plain of Jars\" than anywhere else in the world. Before the war started, more than 50 thousand people lived there, many of whom belonged to the Hmong tribe. When fighter jets could not reach their targets, they would unload bombs on Laos because of the inability to land with bombs on board. For a period of nine years, the U.S. Air Force conducted Air Strike missions against Laos every eight minutes. The worst bombings were around Long Cheng and Sam Thong.\n\nIn 1971 three journalists made it to Laos, uncovered the secret airbase and attempted to expose Long Cheng to the public. Their discovery, however, did not make the front page news. The U.S. military informed U.S. citizens that it was conducting a humanitarian mission in Laos. The media fabricated stories about U.S. building hospitals and providing development aid to Laos. While secret Airstrikes were taking place in other provinces of Laos, Americans in the capital of Laos, Vientiane, were unaware of the situation. The U.S. sent $454 million dollars in aid to Vientiane and built this fa\u00e7ade to keep their covert operations in motion. Finally, in 1975, the CIA evacuated Laos after the Communist Pathet won the civil war.\n\n==Laos 1961==\nIn January 1961, John F. Kennedy became president while at the same time the CIA paramilitary forces were deeply involved in making arrangements for the Bay of Pigs in Cuba which was to occur three months later. Thus, the CIA was unable to adequately supply air support for the Air Force Project code-named Mill Pond.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>  The crews were to fly unmarked B-26 bombers on interdiction missions over Laos. The end result was that the Air Force provided crews, disguised as civilians, for the operation. Either the Air Force itself or the CIA created a phony corporation in Thailand as the ostensible employer of these airmen. The episode marked the first direct commitment of U.S. military forces to the Laotian war.<ref name=\":4\" /> This was due to the resources they thought they'd have available not being available as they were being used to deal with the Cuban missile exile.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{Clarify}}\n\nWith authorization to arm and train 1,000 Hmong as a test of the concept, Lair again visited Vang Pao and arranged for an arms drop at Pa Dong, a mountaintop base south of the PDJ. In January 1961, Air America delivered weapons to the first 300 trainees.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n  \nAccording to ''Time'',\n\n<blockquote> To force him to accept a coalition government, the U.S. stopped paying Laos $3 million a month in economic aid, but there has never been any skimping in U.S. equipment and the training of Phoumi's Royal Laotian Army. The grim truth\u2014as shown again last month at Nam Tha\u2014is that Phoumi's men will not fight. Some observers suggest Phoumi wanted his army to collapse to force U.S. intervention\u2014perhaps relying on President Kennedy's March 1961 telecast, when he said that a Red takeover in Laos would \"quite obviously affect the security of the U.S.\"</blockquote>\n\nAmerican visibility increased in 1961, possibly as a signal to Phoumi. The covert advisory group was acknowledged, and called the White Star organization, commanded by [[Arthur D. Simons]]<ref name=Simons1961>{{citation\n | title = Arthur D.

By the middle of 1961, the Laotian Army Air force (LAAF), who had always struggled with morale, skill, and equipment, were aided by the USAF. American pilots trained the LAAF in terms of flight techniques. Some of them spoke French, but even the ones who could not demonstrate leadership qualities that earned respect from the Laotian pilots. Though the T-6, the LAAF fighter pilot, lacked armor and was not permitted to carry bombs, their training made the pilots more nimble in the air, as well as enhanced their morale.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web | title = The War in Northern Laos|page= 57 | url= http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn the early months of 1961, Air America had only a handful of helicopters and STOL aircraft available to support CIA operations in Laos. This changed in early March when the new administration of President Kennedy became alarmed after Kong Le and the Pathet Lao captured a key road junction and threatened Vientiane and the royal capital at Luang Prabang. Kennedy again placed U.S. military forces in the region on alert, and he also authorized the transfer of 14 UH-34 helicopters from the Marine Corps to Air America to be flown by Marine, Army, and Navy \"volunteers.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nPresident Kennedy began seeking a diplomatic solution at a June 1961 meeting in Vienna. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev both supported a neutral and independent Laos through a joint statement. As this meeting took place negotiators in Geneva got together to work out a settlement to the problem.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\n==Laos 1962==\n[[File:Richard L. Holm and a Hmong resistance fighter in Laos in mid-1962.gif|thumb|CIA operative [[Dick Holm]] and a Hmong fighter in mid-1962.]]\nThe CIA-organized group of Hmong tribesmen fighting in the [[Vietnam War]] is known as the \"Secret Army\", and their participation was called the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]], where the Secret War is meant to denote the [[Laotian Civil War]] (1960\u20131975) and the Laotian front of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nOn July 23, 1962, a formal \"Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos\" was signed in Geneva. This neutrality provided for a coalition government and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country by October 7. After this declaration was signed the U.S. pulled out 666 military advisors and support staff, and Air America stopped dropping weapons to the Hmong. The U.S. followed the guidelines of this declaration and only allowed the CIA to retain only two men in Laos to monitor Communist compliance with the agreement.d.<ref name=\"Leary\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Prados|first1=John|title=FIGHTING THE WAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, 1961-1973|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|website=The National Security Archive|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCIA offices soon found that the North Vietnamese Army had failed to remove 7000 troops, who were expanding Northern Vietnamese positions in Laos. CIA reports from officers in the hills were soon pleading for arms so that the Hmong could defend themselves against the NVA onslaught. Secretary of State [[Averell Harriman]] granted these requests on an individual basis going forward.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nOn August 17, 1962, five American prisoners released by the Pathet Lao, as well as several members of NSBC in Laos, estimated the North Vietnamese Forces in Laos to be around 10,000. CIA road watch teams reported trucks full of North Vietnamese troops heading toward the North Vietnamese border, but would be unable to confirm whether all the troops had left Laos. A document released by the CIA makes a note of Souvanna Phouma possibly making a deal with Souphanouvong to keep the Vietnamese and Chinese communists presence secret if they left Laos, again making it difficult to confirm their departure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80B01676R000200140045-8.pdf|title=VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST FORCES IN LAOS {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Laos 1963==\nReports reaching CIA Headquarters from its two officers in Laos suggested that the apparent quiet was deceptive. It soon became clear that 7,000 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops had not left the country. In fact, the NVA was expanding its areas of control, attacking both neutralist and Hmong positions throughout Laos. As Hmong ammunition stores dwindled, William Colby, who was head of the CIA's Far East Division, pleaded to Harriman to allow the resumption of air shipments. \"My arguments became more forceful,\" Colby recalled, \"reflecting the intense cables I was receiving from the two CIA officers who were still up in the hills observing and reporting on what was happening.\" Harriman reluctantly approved an Air America arms drop\u2014along with instructions that it is used for purely defensive purposes. Further shipments followed. As Colby pointed out, however, Harriman personally approved \"each and every clandestine supply flight and its cargo.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nAs Hanoi sent additional troops into Laos during 1963, the Kennedy administration authorized the CIA to increase the size of the Hmong army, now headquartered in the valley of Long Tieng. By the end of the year, a reported 20,000 Hmong were armed. They acted as guerrillas, blowing up NVA supply depots, ambushing trucks, mining roads, and generally harassing the stronger enemy force. Air America again took a greater role in the slowly expanding conflict.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\n==Laos 1964==\nIn 1964 marked the initially limited employment of U.S.-Thailand and Laos operations. The United States believed that because there was more communist activity in Laos, it threatened South Vietnam. The Royal Laotian Air Force (RLAF) began to receive increased support from the United States. Counterinsurgency training, assisting cooperation, and logistical support were some of the types of aids provided at this time.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/usaf_64.pdf|title=USAF plans and policies in South Vietnam and Laos, 1964 |date=1964|website=www.nsarchive.gwu.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825003157/https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/usaf_64.pdf |archivedate=August 25, 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref> The RLAF saw an additional endowment of resources from the US after a failed right-wing attempted coup catalyzed a resurrection of Pathet Lao onslaughts on rightists and neutralists in the Plaines des Jarres. Full-scale fighting broke out in Laos in March 1964 when North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces attacked across the Plaines des Jarres. In mid-May the communists had taken control of the strategic region.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Ordnance was also released shortly thereafter, so the RLAF could strike the Communists.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBecause the airstrikes only allowed to be performed by the RLAF, at the request of the U.S. ambassador in Vientianne, the RLAF received seven T-28s loaned temporarily by the U.S. On 20 May, an additional 10 T/RT-28 were loaned by South Vietnam to the RLAF.  At this time, the U.S. Joint Chief of Staff agreed to send three C-47 to train the RLAF pilots. The C-47s and 21 personnel arrived in Ubon on 24 July and immediately started to train the Laotian air and ground crew.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn January 1964, the CIA began training Lao and Thai counterinsurgents in Thailand. This was because the previous Geneva agreements did not allow for training to take place in Laos. The hope was for these counterinsurgents to be able to fight back if and when Vietcong forces should move offensively through Laos. During 1964 the RLAF - Royal Laotian Air Force - were loaned a total of 33 T-28 bombers for use in the fighting.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nIn May 1964, the U.S. Air Force began flying reconnaissance missions over the Laotian panhandle to obtain target information on men and equipment shuttled into South Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\nThe problem addressed by the Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) of May 25 was to determine if there was a set of actions that would cause the Democratic (i.e., North) Republic of Vietnam (DRV) to reduce activities in the Republic (i.e., South) of Vietnam (RVN), and to respect the 1962 Geneva agreements on Laos. It assumed the air and naval action primarily without attacks on population centers or the use of nuclear weapons. The DRV, China, and USSR would be informed that U.S. intentions were limited.\n\nOn June 24, 1964, the U.S. government formally endorsed Operation Triangle. This endorsement allowed for escorting fighters to strike enemy activity detected during such flights while opening the door to armed recon missions. The U.S. Army and Air Force personnel were allowed to serve as advisors to the Laotian troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos-119-125.pdf |title=The Pace Quickens: Summer 1964 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTowards the middle of the summer in 1964, the U.S. involvement in Laos had relieved many military issues.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Many of the American-endorsed operations in Laos proved successful and, in turn, incentivized more involvement. Various proposals were put in motion requesting quicker mission approvals and more lenient rules of engagement. However, none of these proposals were approved, and involvement in Laos remained limited.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The U.S. concluded that Laos' military situation was more stable, despite issues in South Vietnam becoming more apparent and serious.\n\nEstimates had the DRV waiting on military action while stirring diplomatic opinion against the U.S. In the absence of U.S forces in Laos, however, it was judged capable of taking control of the country. While the DRV could resist an RVN ground attack, its air defenses were primitive and would be unlikely to accept Chinese assistance other than perhaps antiaircraft guns but not fighters. The estimate did suggest that a campaign against the North would have to be quick and intense, not the gradual escalation that was used.<ref name=\"SNIE50-2-64\">{{cite web\n | title = SNIE 50-2-64 Probable Consequences of Certain US Actions with Respect to Vietnam and Laos\n | date = May 25, 1964\n | url = http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_50-2-64.pdf\n | author = Central Intelligence Agency\n | url-status = dead\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144820/http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_50-2-64.pdf\n | archivedate = February 27, 2008\n | df = mdy-all\n }}</ref>\n\n==Laos 1965==\nThe year 1965 marked the beginning of major military activity in what became known as the secret war in Laos. Although the full extent of the conflict was not revealed to the U.S. public until 1969-70, the war was not all that secret. News of the fighting frequently found its way into the pages of ''The Bangkok Post'', ''The New York Times'', and other newspapers. Congress was kept well informed. As former CIA Director Richard Helms has pointed out, the Appropriations subcommittees were regularly briefed on the war funds. Also, Senator Stuart Symington and other Congressmen visited Laos and gave every indication of approving what transpired. They believed, Helms noted, that \"It was a much cheaper and better way to fight a war in Southeast Asia than to commit American troops.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nThe CIA was largely responsible for conducting military operations in Laos, but the U.S. Ambassador was the man in charge. The secret war in Laos, author Charles Stevenson has emphasized, \"was William Sullivan's war.\" Ambassador from December 1964 to March 1969, Sullivan insisted on an efficient, closely controlled country team. \"There wasn't a bag of rice dropped in Laos that he didn't know about,\" observed Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy. Sullivan imposed two conditions upon his subordinates. First, the thin fiction of the Geneva accords had to be maintained to avoid possible embarrassment to the Lao and Soviet Governments; military operations, therefore, had to be carried out in relative secrecy. Second, no regular US ground troops were to become involved. In general, Ambassador Sullivan and his successor, G. McMurtrie Godley, successfully carried out this policy.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nUSAF-Navy combat sorties from July through November ranged from about 1,000 to 1,500 per month. In November, because of a perceived rise in communist activity, Gen. Westmoreland increased his required number of sorties to 4,500 per month, but because of bad weather and some diversion of the effort, achieved 2,700.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/usaf_65.pdf|title=USAF PLANS AND OPERATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 1965|last=Van Staaven|first=Jacob|date=|website=|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March, the American embassy and MACV was able to successfully implement \"a small-scale chokepoint program.\" This program was aimed at preventing easy commerce between North Vietnam and Laos to \"increase the burden on enemy supply lines.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAn Air America combat rescue mission in May 1965 resulted in the most serious accidental airstrike incident to date, even though Ambassador William Sullivan thought that the contractor was more likely to avoid incidents than the Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn Christmas, 1965, President Johnson promised a bombing halt on Vietnam.

A joint response from the CIA and the Departments of Defense and State said:\n\n:*U.S. ability to control (including veto) a Lao operation is to all practical purposes complete because U.S. mat\u00e9riel and air support are vital.\n:*In practice, most operations are conceived by commanders of individual Military Regions in close conjunction with U.S. Military Attach\u00e9s or in the case of Vang Pao and the other irregulars, with the local CIA Area Chief. *In brief, the U.S. clearance procedures are as follows: \n:*The cognizant U.S. military attach\u00e9 or CIA Area Chief forwards the request to U.S. Country Team, consisting of Ambassador, DCM, Military Attach\u00e9s and CIA Station Chief.\n:*Vang Pao's operations are also cleared by the CIA base at Udom, Thailand which assesses the Agency's ability to provide the necessary support.\n:*The Ambassador requests authorization from State for politically sensitive operations or activities exceeding established operating procedures and refers requests for air support to MACV. To combat Northern Vietnamese advancements the United States bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail along with North Vietnamese troop concentrations in northern Laos. Through the United States Air Force there was an effort that took place to upgrade air operations located in northern Laos. The U.S. Air Force introduced airborne radio direction finding. The EC-47 aircraft could monitor and locate enemy radio transmissions. Colonel Duskin convinced Robert A. Hurwitz that the OV-1 Mohawk could enhance intelligence collections during Barrel Roll which provided night-time reconnaissance.\n\nThe 1969 communist offensive spurred improvements in the Royal Laotian Air Force as well. Laotian T-28 plane counts jumped from 235 to 1367 in five months. The increase in plane production called for a need for more pilots to be trained. Also, \"hampered by monsoon rains, among the heaviest ever seen, ABOUT FACE got underway on 6 August 1969. Eight battalions moved on the Plain of Jars while two more battalions and several hundred Hmong militias approached the road between Ban Ban and Nong Pet. Not to be confused with NangHet, on the Vietnamese border. The significance of Nang Petlay in its location west of Ban Ban at the intersection of Route 7, leading directly into the Plain of Jars, and Route 71, which bypassed the plain to the north. The weather posed more of an obstacle than the communists, who to the attackers' astonished delight abandoned without a fight not only their defensive positions but also major supply dumps. Despite suspected leaks of Vang Pao's intentions, the government forces had achieved complete tactical surprise, and the overextended enemy simply melted away.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Even where the enemy had time to react, he stood by and watched the irregulars advance.\n\nOn 20 August, two SGU battalions, one Hmong and the other a Lao unit from Pakse, walked up Phou Nok Kok, the mountain commanding Route 7 between Ban Ban and 'Nong Pet. The communists did not respond until two days later, and not insufficient strength to threaten SGU positions on the heights. By then, the irregulars on Phou Nok Kok became the core of the effort to deny Route 7 to the enemy.  By the 25'\" the enemy had abandoned any effort to reclaim Phou Nok Kok.\n\nOn 27 August, Vang Pao's irregulars marched onto the plain itself, taking the southern salient and capturing a PT-76 tank, an artillery piece, and a truck. By this time, the Pakse SGU had cut Route 7, and its troops were patrolling the road west of Ban Ban. The station applauded the irregulars' success but wanted credit to go where credit was due.  \"Extremely effective airstrikes have been the key factor in guerrilla successes thus far. Heavily committed in the Muong Soui sector, to the west, and now challenged east of the plain, the North Vietnamese had contributed to Vang Pao's advance onto the plain by entrusting its defense largely to the Pathet Lao.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Laos 1970s==\nOn February 12, 1970, \"the communists attacked irregular units on the Plain of Jars, and Souvanna Phouma, presumably encouraged by Ambassador Godley, formally requested B-52 support.

There were more than 300 pilots, copilots, flight mechanics, and air-freight specialists flying out of Laos and Thailand. During 1970, Air America airdropped or landed 46 million pounds of foodstuffs\u2014mainly rice\u2014in Laos. Helicopter flight time reached more than 4,000 hours a month in the same year. Air America crews transported tens of thousands of troops and refugees, flew emergency medevac missions and rescued downed airmen throughout Laos, inserted and extracted road-watch teams, flew nighttime airdrop missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, monitored sensors along infiltration routes, conducted photo-reconnaissance and numerous clandestine missions.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nOn April 21, 1972, the CIA was ordered to give up control of Air America and related companies. Air America dissolved upon the conclusion of the end of the American War in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> On April 24, 1971, the Air America vice president for flight operations sent a message warning all crew members that there had been an appalling number of deaths and serious injuries.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> According to the warning, the airlines was performing under the most difficult environmental conditions in the world.

On June 3, 1974, the last Air America aircraft crossed the border from Laos into Thailand.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nIn 1973, there was a report stating that \"distrustful as always of FAR security practice, Vang Pao insisted that all forces committed to the new operation (dubbed ABOUT FACE) of Hmong SGUs, most of which was trying to fend off the North Vietnamese on the periphery of the Plain of Jars.

By the summer of 1970 the CIA owned airline Air America had two dozen twin-engine transports, two dozen STOL aircraft and 30 helicopters dedicated to the operations in Laos. This airline employed more than 300 pilots, copilots, flight mechanics, and airfreight specialists flying out of Laos and Thailand.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Although the bombing campaign was eventually disclosed to the American public formally in 1969, stories about the Laos bombing effort were published prior to that in ''The New York Times''.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Even after the United States government made the war public, the American people were in the dark as to how large scale the bombing campaign was.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Politics of Laos and the CIA===\nA 1962 ''Time Magazine'' article about [[Laos]] makes some points that help illustrate the context of the overt and covert actions of all sides in Laos before the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\">{{cite journal\n | title =LAOS: Four Phases to Nonexistence\n | date = June 8, 1962\n | journal = Time\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896299-1,00.html\n}}</ref> One of the first points the article makes is that a Laotian national identity, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, was a rare thing (since Laos had been a territory of [[Thailand]] and part of the vast French-controlled Indochina for generations). [[Communist]] groups and those from outside, including the French colonial administration and the CIA, often exploited power vacuums that existed within the region.\n\n\"Though it has a king, a government and an army and can be found on a map, Laos does not really exist. Many of its estimated 2,000,000 people would be astonished to be called Laotians since they know themselves to be Meo or Black Thai or Khalom tribesmen among other small ethnic groups that resided in the countryside. It is a land without a railroad, a single paved highway or a newspaper. Its chief cash crop was opium.\"\n\nLaos was dreamed up by French Diplomat Jean Chauvel, who in 1946 was France's Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs. At the time, post World War II France was trying to reassert its authority over its colonies in Indo-China. The rebellious inhabitants had no desire to return to their prewar status as colonial subjects. In place of original Indo-China, consisting of various kingdoms and principalities, Paris put together three new autonomous states within the French Union: Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos. Drawing lines on a map, Chauvel created Laos by merging the rival kingdoms of Luangprabang, whose monarch became King of Laos, with Champassak, whose pretender was consoled by being made permanent Inspector General of the new state.\n\nFrench influence did not survive long after the 1954 defeat at [[Dien Bien Phu]]. When the French declared Laos independent, it did not have a cohesive government: two Laotian provinces were run by the communist Pathet Lao under Prince [[Souphanouvong]]. His half-brother, Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], was chosen as Premier in 1956, and Souphanouvong and his provinces were put underneath the fledgling central government. A subsequent national election increased communist strength in the National Assembly to nine of the 21 seats, which aroused the ire of the U.S. government, which distrusted Souvanna Phouma, \"both as a neutralist and a compromise with the Reds.\"<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\" /> Regime change to the [[right-wing]] General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] came not from a coup, but from stopping U.S. economic aid, which was the responsibility, subordinate to the White House, of the U.S. [[Agency for International Development]]. The new dictator invited U.S. military advisors, who came with both [[U.S. Defense Department]] and CIA personnel.\n\n===CIA operations in Laos, proprietary airlines===\nAccording to [[William M. Leary]], a historian at the University of Georgia who analyzed Laotian operations for the CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence, CIA-led covert action in Laos was the largest paramilitary operation in the history of the Agency.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nIn 1950, the CIA\u2014supporting but not directing covert action until 1952\u2014determined that it could best meet its support responsibilities with a proprietary airline under its private control. \"In August 1950, the Agency secretly purchased the assets of Civil Air Transport (CAT), an airline that had been started in China after World War II by Gen. Claire L. Chennault and Whiting Willauer. CAT would continue to fly commercial routes throughout Asia, acting in every way as a privately owned commercial airline. At the same time, under the corporate guise of CAT Incorporated, it provided airplanes and crews for secret intelligence operations. During the [[Korean War]], for example, it made more than 100 hazardous overflights of mainland China, airdropping agents and supplies.\"<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n====Allegations of CIA drug trafficking====\n{{main|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking}}\n\nAs a Ph.D. candidate in [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] at [[Yale University]], [[Alfred W.

He stated that his two decades of research found Air America not involved in drug trafficking. Nonetheless, McCoy finds the CIA culpable in drug-trafficking on the part of the Laotians. According to Leary, \"The CIA's main focus in Laos remained on fighting the war, not on policing the drug trade.\"<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n==Laos 1953==\nIn April 1953, the French had established a leading military base at Dien Bien Phu, based deep in a mountain basin in Tonkin Province remote northwestern Vietnam. The base was designed to block communist supply lines in neighboring Laos. The base would also be a tantalizing target for the Viet Minh attacks that the French could readily defend with their superior firepower. Unfortunately, the communist foes besieged the base and five other separate firebases which facilitated to the French colonial forces in Indochina requesting U.S. air transport \"to fly tanks and heavy equipment to their hard-pressed forces in Laos. \"Having such equipment,\" the French emphasized, \"might mean the difference between holding and losing Laos.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nAt this point, the CAT role evolved from clandestine to covert. The Eisenhower Administration, unwilling to give overt support, decided to use CAT to fulfill the French request, in Operation SQUAW. The U.S. Air Force provided CAT with \"sterile\" (i.e., with American military identification removed) [[C-119]] transports, capable of carrying the heavy loads required by the French. CAT personnel was unfamiliar with the C-119, and the Air Force held a short but intense training course for them at [[Clark Air Force Base]] in the Philippines. On May 5, they flew six of the transports, repainted with French insignia, to [[Gia Lam]] airbase, outside [[Hanoi]], and parachuted supplies and equipment to French forces in Laos until July 16 with CAT pilots making numerous airdrops to French troops in Laos.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n==Laos (and Vietnam) 1954==\nAgain, the French asked for help in supporting their isolated base at [[Dien Bien Phu]]. CAT, contracting with the French in January 1954 to provide 24 pilots to fly 12 C-119 aircraft, agreed to maintenance under USAF ground crews at Hanoi's Cat Bi airfield in support of Dien Bien Phu. Flights started in March, as the [[Viet Minh]] began their assault, and continued until Dien Bien Phu fell on May 7. Two CAT pilots died and one other wounded.\n\nCAT operations continued after the fall of Dien Bien Phu. The C-119s supported isolated French outposts, and CAT also provided 12 [[C-46]] transports to evacuate civilians from North to South Vietnam. CAT also carried members of the CIA's Saigon Military Mission<ref name=\"PPv1D95\">{{cite web\n | title = Document 95, Lansdale Team's Report on Covert Saigon Mission in 1954 and 1955 \n | work = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 1\n | pages = 573\u201383\n | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/doc95.htm\n}}</ref> (see [[#Vietnam 1954|Vietnam 1954]]) north of the 17th parallel, in a futile attempt to set up [[stay-behind]] networks. Laos was declared neutral but due to its location, it effectively functioned as a microcosm of the war. Per the [[Domino theory]], the United States proclaimed Laos a buffer state due to it bordering North Vietnam and China.\n\n==Laos 1955==\nIn January 1955, the U.S. created the United States Operations Mission (USOM) in [[Vientiane]], Laos, to provide foreign aid. By the end of the year, a [[Programs Evaluation Office]] (PEO), staffed by retired military personnel or military officers, quietly delegated leadership to the CIA. The PEO was a covert equivalent to a [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] (MAAG), organized within USOM to handle military aid, though not usually within the scope of USOM. The CIA was involved with the PEO until US military involvement was acknowledged and a MAAG established.\n\n<blockquote>In July 1955, USOM officials learned that a rice failure threatened famine in several provinces in Laos. Because a number of these areas were in remote, mountainous regions, airdrops proved the only feasible means to delivering essential supplies of rice and salt. Three CAT C-46s arrived at the northeastern railhead of [[Udon Thani]], [[Thailand]] on September 11 to begin the airlift. By the end of the month, CAT had flown more than 200 missions to 25 reception areas having delivered 1,000 tons of emergency food. This airdrop relief operation, conducted with smooth efficiency, marked the beginning of CAT's--and later Air America's--support of U.S. assistance programs in Laos.<ref name=\"Leary\" />></blockquote>\n\n==Laos 1957==\nA new CAT contract was signed in 1957, and Bruce Blevins flew a [[C-47]] to Vientiane in the service of the U.S. Embassy. When he flew elsewhere in the country, conditions were technologically underdeveloped. Vientiane had the only control tower, radio navigational aid, and non-dirt runway in Laos. The U.S., again through covert means, increased its level of support.\n\nFurthermore, a 1957 cable from American intelligence officials in Laos to Washington noted the inability for the Communist Pathet Lao (PL) and Royal Laotian Guard (RLG) to come to a peaceful resolution. The cable stated that in late 1957, agreements were signed between the two groups to cease civil conflict. While the deal was also intended to result in the assimilation of the PL into larger Laotian society, the CIA had gathered intelligence implying that the PL had not meant to abandon its \"radical\" ideology and desire to overthrow the democratic government headed by the RLG. Instead, the CIA believed that the PL desired to establish a Communist government via subversive political and covert actions as opposed to overt military operations. Nevertheless, the CIA feared that the PL was more than willing to revert to the use of force if their new tactics proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe following cable demonstrates this type of subversion: \"PL propagandists and terrorists continued to visit the villages telling the villagers to refuse to obey RLG officials, and that the PL would soon take overall power and punish those who opposed them, and that the refusal of the people to support the PL would mean a renewal of the civil war.\"<ref>\"Transmittal of Study of Communist Subversion in Laos.\" https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000900210003-6.pdf</ref> As a result, the return of the two provinces to the RLG had been nullified and the PL continued to rule the provinces except places occupied by Lao National Army.\n\n==Laos 1958==\nIn an October 1958 memorandum, the CIA acknowledged that the agency had been handed the responsibility to oversee covert operations within Laos. The State Department recognized the CIA's covert operations and suggested the development of overt operations. Additionally, the State Department outlined a document that covered all hypothetical situations in Chile and hinted that the CIA might consider taking action for one of those hypothetical operations. The memorandum requested the chief of the Far East Division to consider the role of the CIA in Laos and how valid their suggestions for operations were. This memorandum revealed that there existed a well-thought-out plot that took into account Laotian concerns and U.S. interests in Laos and not merely a simple military reaction. However, the actual plans were redacted from the document as well as the names of those involved. Though this could suggest the planning of something more wicked, it could also be a diplomatic choice in not angering a nation long after the fact that certain considerations were never acted upon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hypothetical Situation in Laos|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00036R001100190007-2.pdf|website=CIA Reading Room|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the civil war grew in intensity, CAT C-47s and C-46s passed with ever greater frequency over Vientiane to fulfill urgent airdrop requests. Blevins was also kept busy, landing throughout the country and making numerous airdrops to isolated FAR posts. He developed an especially close relationship with a CIA case officer who had arrived in October 1958 and who was assigned to support neutralist Capt. [[Kong Le]]'s parachute battalion, a Laotian officer who would rise to the highest ranks.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\n==Laos 1959==\n\nVictor B. Anthony and Richard R. Sexton, two Air Force historians, prepared a 400-page document called ''The War in Northern Laos, 1954-1973'', based on two separate manuscripts. In this document, it shows that as early as 1959, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had conceived a plan for U.S. military intervention in Laos, two years earlier than previously thought.

These soldiers led [[Miao people|Meo]] and [[Hmong people#The \"Secret War\"|Hmong]] tribesmen against Communist forces. The covert program was called [[Operation White Star|Operation Hotfoot]].

They believed that the anti-Pathet policies had little chance of success due to the invasion.<ref name=\":2\" /> The U.S. Special Forces Group, code-named Hotfoot under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur \"Bull\" Simons, penetrated Laos. Twelve Mobile Training Teams took up duties in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Pakse. CIA officials in Laos had requested additional air transport resources. The CIA, in August 1959, directed CIA proprietary Air America to train two helicopter pilots. Further, Air America directed search and rescue missions in Laos in addition to its role in combat operations.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> Originally posted as a short-term requirement, this operation served as the beginning of a significant rotary-wing operation in Laos. Vang Pao expressed concerns that the Hmong were likely to suffer reprisals from communists. With assistance from a U.S. Special Forces team, he began to organize a Hmong stay-behind force. Declassified documents from 2008 also revealed that the U.S. ambassador in Laos at the time served as the field commander of the so-called \"secret war\" there.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOutside of just training locals, previously secret U.S. Air Force official histories of the Vietnam war were published in April 2008 by the National Security Archive which disclosed for the first time that Central Intelligence Agency contract employees had a direct role in combat air attacks when they flew Laotian government aircraft on strike missions. Additionally, the Air Force actively considered nuclear weapons options during the 1959 Laos crisis.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBy December 1959, Vang Pao had to either fight the communists or leave the country. If the United States supplied the weapons, Vang Pao claimed that he would fight and raise an army of 10,000.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nThis aforementioned activity in 1959 was caused by an inability to integrate the Pathet Lao communist military into the Royal Lao Armed forces, precipitating a civil war in which the CIA ordered the Air Force to deploy a squadron of B-47 bombers to the Clark Air Force Base. This deployment ensured that the bomber could be used to interfere or destroy Pathet Lao communications to the North Vietnamese.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Laos 1960==\nFrom 1960 to 1961, the CIA initiated operations code-named Erawan in which U.S. Special Forces trained Laotian soldiers in methods of unconventional warfare used the enemy.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\"/> The previous training of the Laotian military was underdeveloped and had \u201ccaused friction between the Americans and the French.\u201d After a request from Phoumi in February, Washington decided to extend training programs for the Laotian military. However, negotiations over the nature and structure of the training programs created divisions between the French, Washington, and Phoumi. The French wanted to retain complete control over the Laotian Army, but Phoumi objected. Phoumi asserted his desire to have the French completely removed from Laos. He also voiced sentiments advocating for the U.S. Special Forces to control the training operations. The French voiced objections to U.S. presence in Laos stating that such intervention violated the Geneva accords, a position supported by Souvanna Phouma. After a long series of negotiations combined with interventions from the Royal Thailand Government, U.S. Special Forces infiltrated the Lao countryside and began training Laotians in unconventional warfare and anti-guerilla tactics.\n\nEventually, four CAT pilots were trained on U.S. Air Force H-19A helicopters in Japan and the Philippines. The CAT contingent did not reach Laos until March 1960. Due to the operating limitations of the H-19s, the underpowered helicopters could fly only at lower elevations in the country. \"Generally, they were used to carry CIA case officers to meetings in outlying areas and to distribute leaflets during elections. By June 1960, it had become clear that helicopters would form a permanent part of Air America's operations in Laos.\"<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nAir America hired four experienced U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilots who obtained their discharges in Okinawa to fly the H-19s. Later in the year, the CIA arranged for the Marine Corps to transfer four UH-34 helicopters to Air America to replace the H-19s.\n\nAlso in 1960, a national election was held of dubious integrity. \"Phoumi's group gained a sweeping majority. On the surface, a relatively tough U.S. policy of containing Communism seemed to be an overwhelming success... $250 million in U.S. economic and military aid had too powerful an effect on the Laotian government, which was soon reeling with corruption. Promised reforms never materialized, and practically no funds reached the peasants and forest tribes. The Communist Pathet Lao guerrilla bands began raiding in the north. Red Prince Souphanouvong not only walked out of jail but took most of his prison guards with him.\"<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\" />\n\nIn August 1960, Kong Le, who had formed a friendship with a CIA officer in 1958, still returned neutralist Souvanna Phouma to power with a military coup. Phoumi Nosavan, who had much closer CIA relations, took refuge in his base in Savannakhet, in southern Laos.\n\nThe U.S. encouraged Phoumi Nosavan, in December, to attack Kong Le's battalion in Vientiane.\n\n<blockquote> Kong Le retreated to the strategic Plaine des Jarres, joining forces with the Pathet Lao. The Soviet Union poured in supplies by air, and Communist North Vietnam contributed tough guerrilla cadres. When Phoumi's army advanced, it was badly beaten in a series of noisy but largely bloodless battles. Phoumi got some breathing space when, in the spring of 1961, the government eagerly agreed to a ceasefire.<ref name=\"Time1962-06-08\" /></blockquote>\n\nFrom 1960 to 1975 The CIA ran a clandestine sideshow to the Vietnam war in Laos. Long Cheng was a secret air base built by the CIA during the Vietnam war. This base was so secretive that not even Congress was aware of its existence. Long Cheng was unmarked, un-mapped and known only by a select few. It became the CIA Headquarter during the Vietnam war and was so active that more than four hundred flights flew to and from Long Cheng on a daily basis. The secret operations in Laos grew into the largest CIA operation in history. Laos was used as a pawn for its strategic positioning between its neighboring countries from which the United States could launch military attacks. Laos has been reported as the most intensely bombed country in the history of Air Strike War. More bombs were dropped in the \"Plain of Jars\" than anywhere else in the world. Before the war started, more than 50 thousand people lived there, many of whom belonged to the Hmong tribe. When fighter jets could not reach their targets, they would unload bombs on Laos because of the inability to land with bombs on board. For a period of nine years, the U.S. Air Force conducted Air Strike missions against Laos every eight minutes. The worst bombings were around Long Cheng and Sam Thong.\n\nIn 1971 three journalists made it to Laos, uncovered the secret airbase and attempted to expose Long Cheng to the public. Their discovery, however, did not make the front page news. The U.S. military informed U.S. citizens that it was conducting a humanitarian mission in Laos. The media fabricated stories about U.S. building hospitals and providing development aid to Laos. While secret Airstrikes were taking place in other provinces of Laos, Americans in the capital of Laos, Vientiane, were unaware of the situation. The U.S. sent $454 million dollars in aid to Vientiane and built this fa\u00e7ade to keep their covert operations in motion. Finally, in 1975, the CIA evacuated Laos after the Communist Pathet won the civil war.\n\n==Laos 1961==\nIn January 1961, John F. Kennedy became president while at the same time the CIA paramilitary forces were deeply involved in making arrangements for the Bay of Pigs in Cuba which was to occur three months later. Thus, the CIA was unable to adequately supply air support for the Air Force Project code-named Mill Pond.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>  The crews were to fly unmarked B-26 bombers on interdiction missions over Laos. The end result was that the Air Force provided crews, disguised as civilians, for the operation. Either the Air Force itself or the CIA created a phony corporation in Thailand as the ostensible employer of these airmen. The episode marked the first direct commitment of U.S. military forces to the Laotian war.<ref name=\":4\" /> This was due to the resources they thought they'd have available not being available as they were being used to deal with the Cuban missile exile.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{Clarify}}\n\nWith authorization to arm and train 1,000 Hmong as a test of the concept, Lair again visited Vang Pao and arranged for an arms drop at Pa Dong, a mountaintop base south of the PDJ. In January 1961, Air America delivered weapons to the first 300 trainees.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n  \nAccording to ''Time'',\n\n<blockquote> To force him to accept a coalition government, the U.S. stopped paying Laos $3 million a month in economic aid, but there has never been any skimping in U.S. equipment and the training of Phoumi's Royal Laotian Army. The grim truth\u2014as shown again last month at Nam Tha\u2014is that Phoumi's men will not fight. Some observers suggest Phoumi wanted his army to collapse to force U.S. intervention\u2014perhaps relying on President Kennedy's March 1961 telecast, when he said that a Red takeover in Laos would \"quite obviously affect the security of the U.S.\"</blockquote>\n\nAmerican visibility increased in 1961, possibly as a signal to Phoumi. The covert advisory group was acknowledged, and called the White Star organization, commanded by [[Arthur D. Simons]]<ref name=Simons1961>{{citation\n | title = Arthur D.

By the middle of 1961, the Laotian Army Air force (LAAF), who had always struggled with morale, skill, and equipment, were aided by the USAF. American pilots trained the LAAF in terms of flight techniques. Some of them spoke French, but even the ones who could not demonstrate leadership qualities that earned respect from the Laotian pilots. Though the T-6, the LAAF fighter pilot, lacked armor and was not permitted to carry bombs, their training made the pilots more nimble in the air, as well as enhanced their morale.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web | title = The War in Northern Laos|page= 57 | url= http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn the early months of 1961, Air America had only a handful of helicopters and STOL aircraft available to support CIA operations in Laos. This changed in early March when the new administration of President Kennedy became alarmed after Kong Le and the Pathet Lao captured a key road junction and threatened Vientiane and the royal capital at Luang Prabang. Kennedy again placed U.S. military forces in the region on alert, and he also authorized the transfer of 14 UH-34 helicopters from the Marine Corps to Air America to be flown by Marine, Army, and Navy \"volunteers.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nPresident Kennedy began seeking a diplomatic solution at a June 1961 meeting in Vienna. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev both supported a neutral and independent Laos through a joint statement. As this meeting took place negotiators in Geneva got together to work out a settlement to the problem.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\n==Laos 1962==\n[[File:Richard L. Holm and a Hmong resistance fighter in Laos in mid-1962.gif|thumb|CIA operative [[Dick Holm]] and a Hmong fighter in mid-1962.]]\nThe CIA-organized group of Hmong tribesmen fighting in the [[Vietnam War]] is known as the \"Secret Army\", and their participation was called the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]], where the Secret War is meant to denote the [[Laotian Civil War]] (1960\u20131975) and the Laotian front of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nOn July 23, 1962, a formal \"Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos\" was signed in Geneva. This neutrality provided for a coalition government and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country by October 7. After this declaration was signed the U.S. pulled out 666 military advisors and support staff, and Air America stopped dropping weapons to the Hmong. The U.S. followed the guidelines of this declaration and only allowed the CIA to retain only two men in Laos to monitor Communist compliance with the agreement.d.<ref name=\"Leary\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Prados|first1=John|title=FIGHTING THE WAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, 1961-1973|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|website=The National Security Archive|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCIA offices soon found that the North Vietnamese Army had failed to remove 7000 troops, who were expanding Northern Vietnamese positions in Laos. CIA reports from officers in the hills were soon pleading for arms so that the Hmong could defend themselves against the NVA onslaught. Secretary of State [[Averell Harriman]] granted these requests on an individual basis going forward.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nOn August 17, 1962, five American prisoners released by the Pathet Lao, as well as several members of NSBC in Laos, estimated the North Vietnamese Forces in Laos to be around 10,000. CIA road watch teams reported trucks full of North Vietnamese troops heading toward the North Vietnamese border, but would be unable to confirm whether all the troops had left Laos. A document released by the CIA makes a note of Souvanna Phouma possibly making a deal with Souphanouvong to keep the Vietnamese and Chinese communists presence secret if they left Laos, again making it difficult to confirm their departure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80B01676R000200140045-8.pdf|title=VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST FORCES IN LAOS {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Laos 1963==\nReports reaching CIA Headquarters from its two officers in Laos suggested that the apparent quiet was deceptive. It soon became clear that 7,000 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops had not left the country. In fact, the NVA was expanding its areas of control, attacking both neutralist and Hmong positions throughout Laos. As Hmong ammunition stores dwindled, William Colby, who was head of the CIA's Far East Division, pleaded to Harriman to allow the resumption of air shipments. \"My arguments became more forceful,\" Colby recalled, \"reflecting the intense cables I was receiving from the two CIA officers who were still up in the hills observing and reporting on what was happening.\" Harriman reluctantly approved an Air America arms drop\u2014along with instructions that it is used for purely defensive purposes. Further shipments followed. As Colby pointed out, however, Harriman personally approved \"each and every clandestine supply flight and its cargo.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nAs Hanoi sent additional troops into Laos during 1963, the Kennedy administration authorized the CIA to increase the size of the Hmong army, now headquartered in the valley of Long Tieng. By the end of the year, a reported 20,000 Hmong were armed. They acted as guerrillas, blowing up NVA supply depots, ambushing trucks, mining roads, and generally harassing the stronger enemy force. Air America again took a greater role in the slowly expanding conflict.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\n==Laos 1964==\nIn 1964 marked the initially limited employment of U.S.-Thailand and Laos operations. The United States believed that because there was more communist activity in Laos, it threatened South Vietnam. The Royal Laotian Air Force (RLAF) began to receive increased support from the United States. Counterinsurgency training, assisting cooperation, and logistical support were some of the types of aids provided at this time.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/usaf_64.pdf|title=USAF plans and policies in South Vietnam and Laos, 1964 |date=1964|website=www.nsarchive.gwu.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825003157/https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/usaf_64.pdf |archivedate=August 25, 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref> The RLAF saw an additional endowment of resources from the US after a failed right-wing attempted coup catalyzed a resurrection of Pathet Lao onslaughts on rightists and neutralists in the Plaines des Jarres. Full-scale fighting broke out in Laos in March 1964 when North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces attacked across the Plaines des Jarres. In mid-May the communists had taken control of the strategic region.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Ordnance was also released shortly thereafter, so the RLAF could strike the Communists.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBecause the airstrikes only allowed to be performed by the RLAF, at the request of the U.S. ambassador in Vientianne, the RLAF received seven T-28s loaned temporarily by the U.S. On 20 May, an additional 10 T/RT-28 were loaned by South Vietnam to the RLAF.  At this time, the U.S. Joint Chief of Staff agreed to send three C-47 to train the RLAF pilots. The C-47s and 21 personnel arrived in Ubon on 24 July and immediately started to train the Laotian air and ground crew.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn January 1964, the CIA began training Lao and Thai counterinsurgents in Thailand. This was because the previous Geneva agreements did not allow for training to take place in Laos. The hope was for these counterinsurgents to be able to fight back if and when Vietcong forces should move offensively through Laos. During 1964 the RLAF - Royal Laotian Air Force - were loaned a total of 33 T-28 bombers for use in the fighting.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nIn May 1964, the U.S. Air Force began flying reconnaissance missions over the Laotian panhandle to obtain target information on men and equipment shuttled into South Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\nThe problem addressed by the Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) of May 25 was to determine if there was a set of actions that would cause the Democratic (i.e., North) Republic of Vietnam (DRV) to reduce activities in the Republic (i.e., South) of Vietnam (RVN), and to respect the 1962 Geneva agreements on Laos. It assumed the air and naval action primarily without attacks on population centers or the use of nuclear weapons. The DRV, China, and USSR would be informed that U.S. intentions were limited.\n\nOn June 24, 1964, the U.S. government formally endorsed Operation Triangle. This endorsement allowed for escorting fighters to strike enemy activity detected during such flights while opening the door to armed recon missions. The U.S. Army and Air Force personnel were allowed to serve as advisors to the Laotian troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos-119-125.pdf |title=The Pace Quickens: Summer 1964 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTowards the middle of the summer in 1964, the U.S. involvement in Laos had relieved many military issues.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Many of the American-endorsed operations in Laos proved successful and, in turn, incentivized more involvement. Various proposals were put in motion requesting quicker mission approvals and more lenient rules of engagement. However, none of these proposals were approved, and involvement in Laos remained limited.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The U.S. concluded that Laos' military situation was more stable, despite issues in South Vietnam becoming more apparent and serious.\n\nEstimates had the DRV waiting on military action while stirring diplomatic opinion against the U.S. In the absence of U.S forces in Laos, however, it was judged capable of taking control of the country. While the DRV could resist an RVN ground attack, its air defenses were primitive and would to be unlikely to accept Chinese assistance other than perhaps antiaircraft guns but not fighters. The estimate did suggest that a campaign against the North would have to be quick and intense, not the gradual escalation that was used.<ref name=\"SNIE50-2-64\">{{cite web\n | title = SNIE 50-2-64 Probable Consequences of Certain US Actions with Respect to Vietnam and Laos\n | date = May 25, 1964\n | url = http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_50-2-64.pdf\n | author = Central Intelligence Agency\n | url-status = dead\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144820/http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_declass_support/vietnam/SNIE_50-2-64.pdf\n | archivedate = February 27, 2008\n | df = mdy-all\n }}</ref>\n\n==Laos 1965==\nThe year 1965 marked the beginning of major military activity in what became known as the secret war in Laos. Although the full extent of the conflict was not revealed to the U.S. public until 1969-70, the war was not all that secret. News of the fighting frequently found its way into the pages of ''The Bangkok Post'', ''The New York Times'', and other newspapers. Congress was kept well informed. As former CIA Director Richard Helms has pointed out, the Appropriations subcommittees were regularly briefed on the war funds. Also, Senator Stuart Symington and other Congressmen visited Laos and gave every indication of approving what transpired. They believed, Helms noted, that \"It was a much cheaper and better way to fight a war in Southeast Asia than to commit American troops.\"<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nThe CIA was largely responsible for conducting military operations in Laos, but the U.S. Ambassador was the man in charge. The secret war in Laos, author Charles Stevenson has emphasized, \"was William Sullivan's war.\" Ambassador from December 1964 to March 1969, Sullivan insisted on an efficient, closely controlled country team. \"There wasn't a bag of rice dropped in Laos that he didn't know about,\" observed Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy. Sullivan imposed two conditions upon his subordinates. First, the thin fiction of the Geneva accords had to be maintained to avoid possible embarrassment to the Lao and Soviet Governments; military operations, therefore, had to be carried out in relative secrecy. Second, no regular US ground troops were to become involved. In general, Ambassador Sullivan and his successor, G. McMurtrie Godley, successfully carried out this policy.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nUSAF-Navy combat sorties from July through November ranged from about 1,000 to 1,500 per month. In November, because of a perceived rise in communist activity, Gen. Westmoreland increased his required number of sorties to 4,500 per month, but because of bad weather and some diversion of the effort, achieved 2,700.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/usaf_65.pdf|title=USAF PLANS AND OPERATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 1965|last=Van Staaven|first=Jacob|date=|website=|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March, the American embassy and MACV was able to successfully implement \"a small-scale chokepoint program.\" This program was aimed at preventing easy commerce between North Vietnam and Laos to \"increase the burden on enemy supply lines.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAn Air America combat rescue mission in May 1965 resulted in the most serious accidental airstrike incident to date, even though Ambassador William Sullivan thought that the contractor was more likely to avoid incidents than the Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/|title=Fighting the War in Southeast Asia, 1961-1973|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn Christmas, 1965, President Johnson promised a bombing halt on Vietnam.

A joint response from the CIA and the Departments of Defense and State said:\n\n:*U.S. ability to control (including veto) a Lao operation is to all practical purposes complete because U.S. mat\u00e9riel and air support are vital.\n:*In practice, most operations are conceived by commanders of individual Military Regions in close conjunction with U.S. Military Attach\u00e9s or in the case of Vang Pao and the other irregulars, with the local CIA Area Chief. *In brief, the U.S. clearance procedures are as follows: \n:*The cognizant U.S. military attach\u00e9 or CIA Area Chief forwards the request to U.S. Country Team, consisting of Ambassador, DCM, Military Attach\u00e9s and CIA Station Chief.\n:*Vang Pao's operations are also cleared by the CIA base at Udom, Thailand which assesses the Agency's ability to provide the necessary support.\n:*The Ambassador requests authorization from State for politically sensitive operations or activities exceeding established operating procedures and refers requests for air support to MACV. To combat Northern Vietnamese advancements the United States bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail along with North Vietnamese troop concentrations in northern Laos. Through the United States Air Force there was an effort that took place to upgrade air operations located in northern Laos. The U.S. Air Force introduced airborne radio direction finding. The EC-47 aircraft could monitor and locate enemy radio transmissions. Colonel Duskin convinced Robert A. Hurwitz that the OV-1 Mohawk could enhance intelligence collections during Barrel Roll which provided night-time reconnaissance.\n\nThe 1969 communist offensive spurred improvements in the Royal Laotian Air Force as well. Laotian T-28 plane counts jumped from 235 to 1367 in five months. The increase in plane production called for a need for more pilots to be trained. Also, \"hampered by monsoon rains, among the heaviest ever seen, ABOUT FACE got underway on 6 August 1969. Eight battalions moved on the Plain of Jars while two more battalions and several hundred Hmong militias approached the road between Ban Ban and Nong Pet. Not to be confused with NangHet, on the Vietnamese border. The significance of Nang Petlay in its location west of Ban Ban at the intersection of Route 7, leading directly into the Plain of Jars, and Route 71, which bypassed the plain to the north. The weather posed more of an obstacle than the communists, who to the attackers' astonished delight abandoned without a fight not only their defensive positions but also major supply dumps. Despite suspected leaks of Vang Pao's intentions, the government forces had achieved complete tactical surprise, and the overextended enemy simply melted away.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Even where the enemy had time to react, he stood by and watched the irregulars advance.\n\nOn 20 August, two SGU battalions, one Hmong and the other a Lao unit from Pakse, walked up Phou Nok Kok, the mountain commanding Route 7 between Ban Ban and 'Nong Pet. The communists did not respond until two days later, and not insufficient strength to threaten SGU positions on the heights. By then, the irregulars on Phou Nok Kok became the core of the effort to deny Route 7 to the enemy.  By the 25'\" the enemy had abandoned any effort to reclaim Phou Nok Kok.\n\nOn 27 August, Vang Pao's irregulars marched onto the plain itself, taking the southern salient and capturing a PT-76 tank, an artillery piece, and a truck. By this time, the Pakse SGU had cut Route 7, and its troops were patrolling the road west of Ban Ban. The station applauded the irregulars' success but wanted credit to go where credit was due.  \"Extremely effective airstrikes have been the key factor in guerrilla successes thus far. Heavily committed in the Muong Soui sector, to the west, and now challenged east of the plain, the North Vietnamese had contributed to Vang Pao's advance onto the plain by entrusting its defense largely to the Pathet Lao.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Laos 1970s==\nOn February 12, 1970, \"the communists attacked irregular units on the Plain of Jars, and Souvanna Phouma, presumably encouraged by Ambassador Godley, formally requested B-52 support. Nixon granted it, and on the night of 17 February, three bombers hit the advancing North Vietnamese. Photographs and ground observation revealed grievous enemy losses, despite the fact that the time for preparation afforded them by information leaked through insecure FAR radio communications.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRegarding CIA presence by the end of the war; by the summer of 1970, the airline had some two dozen twin-engine transports, another two dozen short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) aircraft, and some 30 helicopters dedicated to operations in Laos. There were more than 300 pilots, copilots, flight mechanics, and air-freight specialists flying out of Laos and Thailand. During 1970, Air America airdropped or landed 46 million pounds of foodstuffs\u2014mainly rice\u2014in Laos. Helicopter flight time reached more than 4,000 hours a month in the same year. Air America crews transported tens of thousands of troops and refugees, flew emergency medevac missions and rescued downed airmen throughout Laos, inserted and extracted road-watch teams, flew nighttime airdrop missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, monitored sensors along infiltration routes, conducted photo-reconnaissance and numerous clandestine missions.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nOn April 21, 1972, the CIA was ordered to give up control of Air America and related companies. Air America dissolved upon the conclusion of the end of the American War in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> On April 24, 1971, the Air America vice president for flight operations sent a message warning all crew members that there had been an appalling number of deaths and serious injuries.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> According to the warning, the airlines was performing under the most difficult environmental conditions in the world. He warned them they should exercise extreme caution when conducting flight operations in Laos.<ref name=\"Leary\"/> Air America's vice president sent this message upon the assumption that Air America was thought to give relinquish control. On June 3, 1974, the last Air America aircraft crossed the border from Laos into Thailand.<ref name=\"Leary\"/>\n\nIn 1973, there was a report stating that \"distrustful as always of FAR security practice, Vang Pao insisted that all forces committed to the new operation (dubbed ABOUT FACE) of Hmong SGUs, most of which was trying to fend off the North Vietnamese on the periphery of the Plain of Jars. Fully in sympathy with Vang Pao's aversion to including FAR-even assuming regular troops were available-Clyde McAvoy introduced an innovation that would become standard' practice until the February 1973 cease-fire.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n\nAlthough the economy of Laos has gradually improved since the United States supplemented it during the Vietnam War, Laos still features the ravages of war and poverty for its war-time generation. Just 9% of the country's present population is over the age of fifty-five, indicating the massive loss of life through war, starvation, and exile. In contrast, neighboring Thailand features roughly 21% of its country over the age of fifty-five.<ref>\"CIA World Fact Book: Laos,\" accessed July 12, 2016, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html</ref>\n\nAir America's public image has fared poorly due in part to the 1990 film ''[[Air America (film)|Air America]].'' Ultimately, the Communist versus anti-Communist war in Laos is depicted as a facade for the real war, which was fought for control of the area's opium fields.<ref name=\"Leary\" />\n\nU.S. bombing inflicted a large number of casualties during the [[Laotian Civil War]]. However, the U.S. State Department's analysis has determined that about 30% of all bombs dropped on Laos failed to detonate. Since 1975, according to a nationwide survey, an estimated 20,000 people in Laos have fallen victim to [[unexploded ordnance]], with 60% of cases resulting in death.<ref>\"New Case for U.S. Reparations in Laos,\" Asia Times Online, accessed July 12, 2016, http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/LI04Ae01.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cluster Bomb Fact Sheet {{!}} Legacies of War |url=http://legaciesofwar.org/resources/cluster-bomb-fact-sheet/|website=legaciesofwar.org |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Rebecca|title=What 80 million unexploded U.S. bombs did to Laos|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/asia/united-states-laos-secret-war/|work=CNN|date=September 6, 2016 |accessdate=November 4, 2016}}</ref> Others sharply criticize the United States for the way it abandoned thousands of Hmong fighters and their families at Long Tieng. Others claim the loss of life could have even been worse if not for some ingenuity on behalf of General [[Harry C. Aderholt|Heinie Alderholt]] and the CIA's [[Jerry Daniels]], who worked to secure a C-130 to evacuate as many Hmong from the airstrip as possible. Daniels later recalled the ordeal, \"All was in turmoil...We took off at 10:47 and this ended the CIA base at Long Tieng.\" Although around 3,000 of the Hmong were able to reach safety through United States transportation, tens of thousands were to remain, many of whom would end up in exile or refugee camps - their previous way of life, as CIA officer [[Dick Holm]] described, \"has been destroyed.\"<ref>Tim Weiner, ''Legacy of Ashes'' (New York: Anchor Books, 2007), 399-400.</ref>\n\nThe aftermath has resulted in a continuing question of whether the United States is responsible for providing further economic assistance to the people of Laos, not only for their fighting through CIA-led units but also for the bombing raids that killed thousands. Many continue to sharply criticize the events of the war in Laos, particularly the CIA-backed inclusion of fourteen-year-olds into the Hmong guerilla units. As one particular youth stated, \"I'm not enjoying the war because I want to study and I want to know more, but the pressure pushes me to be a soldier.\"<ref>''The Most Secret Place on Earth'', DVD, directed by Marc Eberle (2009; Germany; Zweitausendeins).</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the United States gave the people of Laos $12 million to clear bombs from the war. As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) stated, \"The tragic legacy of cluster munitions in Laos is one that all Americans should care about. I hope the additional funds in the fiscal year 2014 will become part of a multi-year program to finally overcome this cruel history and enable the Laotian people to rebuild their lives.\"<ref>\"PRESS RELEASE: U.S. Funding for UXO Clearance Reaches Historic High,\" Legacies of War, accessed July 12, 2016, http://legaciesofwar.org/press-release-u-s-funding-for-uxo-clearance-in-laos-reaches-historic-high/</ref>\n\nAs of 2015, only 1% of the bombed areas in Laos have been cleared for unexploded ordnance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/31/laos-deadly-aftermath-us-bomb-campaign-vietnam-air-attacks|title=The Guardian|last=Fagotto|first=Matteo|date=January 31, 2015|website=|publisher=|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn September 6th, 2016 United States president Barack Obama spoke in Vientiane Laos to an audience of 1,075.

As early as 1891, he asked Andrew Carnegie for building permanent structures, but the steel-mogul-turned-philanthropist refused the librarian's requests for 12 years.  Brett persisted and in 1903 Carnegie donated $250,000 to build seven branches, including the Woodland Branch.

Children living in the city's poorest manufacturing districts could not visit the library downtown or the new branches, so William Howard Brett and Miss Eastman put small reading collections in neighborhood homes.

As early as 1891, he asked Andrew Carnegie for building permanent structures, but the steel-mogul-turned-philanthropist refused the librarian's requests for 12 years.  Brett persisted and in 1903 Carnegie donated $250,000 to build seven branches, including the Woodland Branch.  Carnegie was so impressed with Brett's money management of the funds, he eventually increased the amount to $507,000, which built 15 branches-the foundation for what would become one of the largest branch systems in the United States.  Children living in the city's poorest manufacturing districts could not visit the library downtown or the new branches, so William Howard Brett and Miss Eastman put small reading collections in neighborhood homes.  By 1913, there were 57 \"home libraries\" in seven different working class districts, serving 11 different nationalities: Italian, Greek, Syrian, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Slovak, Irish, German, Danish, and Norwegian.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Lorain Ave Carnegie Library in the City of Cleveland, Ohio.jpg|thumb|right|Lorain Branch]]\n[[File:South Branch Carnegie Library in Cleveland, Ohio.jpg|thumb|right|South Branch]]\n\nCurrently, the Cleveland Public Library has 27 neighborhood branches located throughout the city in addition to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpl.org/locations |title=Locations |publisher=Cleveland Public Library |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n#Addison Branch\n#Brooklyn Branch\n#Carnegie-West Branch - the biggest neighborhood branch at {{convert|25000|sqft|m2}}\n#Collinwood Branch\n#East 131st Street Branch\n#Eastman Branch\n#Fleet Branch\n#Fulton Branch\n#Garden Valley Branch\n#Glenville Branch\n#Harvard-Lee Branch\n#Hough Branch\n#Jefferson Branch\n#Langston Hughes Branch\n#Lorain Branch\n#Martin Luther King, Jr. Branch\n#Memorial-Nottingham Branch - also the location of the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled \n#Mount Pleasant Branch\n#Public Administration Library\n#Rice Branch\n#Rockport Branch\n#South Branch\n#South Brooklyn Branch\n#Sterling Branch\n#Union Branch\n#Walz Branch\n#West Park Branch\n#Woodland Branch\n{{div col end}}\n[[File:Sensory Garden at the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled.jpg|left|thumb|Sensory Garden at the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled]]A Sensory Garden is also adjacent to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled.

His father\u2019s name was Muraridutt. He received his education in [[Varanasi]] and became a ''Bhasyacharya ''(Sanskrit: instructor in the rules of language) of Sanskrit language ''Vyakaran Shastra'' (grammar). Later on he became a famous teacher of the ''[[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] Vyakaran'' (rules of grammar established by Panini) based in [[Churu, Rajasthan|Churu]], Rajasthan.<ref>Sarasvat, Parmanand (1984) ''Sahityasrashta'' Shri Vidyadhar Shastri, Ganu Prakashan, Bikaner p2</ref> The Sanskrit school he established in Churu was known as the Pandit Harnamdutt Sanskrit ''Paatshala.''\n\nProminent names amongst his students include Giridhar Sharma Chaturvedi, ''Vidyavachspat''i Balchandraji, Pandit Ramanandji Maharaj, Pandit Jaidevji Mishra and Pandit Vilasrayaji.\n\nThe Sanskrit ''mahakavya'' (epic poem), ''Haranamamritam'' is a poetic biography written by ''Vidyavachaspati'' [[Vidyadhar Shastri]].\n\n==''Haranamamritam''==\n\nThis ''mahakavya'' depicts the life story of the poet\u2019s grandfather Harnamdutt Shastri. It is not a glorification of his family but strives to enlighten readers about the humble and calm qualities of scholars. The poet also wishes to encourage the writing of new Sanskrit poetry.\n\nThe ''mahakavya'' is divided into sixteen cantos. In the first canto the poet invokes and bows before the Supreme Being, the current work is then stated to be an effort to propagate culture. In the second canto the protagonist\u2019s father Muraridutt receives advice and instructions regarding continuation of the family traditions. In the third canto the protagonist is born in Jagadhri (in present day Haryana), soon afterwards his mother dies and he is raised by an aunt. The young boy is disinterested in studies and enjoys wrestling, his father attempts to direct the boy towards setting up his own household. In the fourth canto the young boy wins a wrestling match but is severely berated by his father. In a fit of anger he leaves his home and heads to [[Delhi]]. He loses a wrestling match in Delhi and inspired by an elderly persons\u2019 advice, heads to Varanasi. The fifth canto begins with a description of the spiritual aspect of Varanasi. As the chapter continues, the young man creates a favorable impression on the teachers; he interacts with fellow students who go on to become famed scholars. After completing his studies Harnamdutt continues in Varanasi as a teacher. Word of his fame as a teacher reaches his father and Muraridutt travels to Varanasi bringing along Harnamdutt\u2019s wife. Upon seeing his son established as a respected teacher, the father is greatly pleased and returns home after a brief stay. In the sixth canto the protagonist establishes his household in Varanasi. Soon a son is born; however, the happiness is cut short by the sudden death of the infant. On recovering from the tragedy, he devotes himself to prayer and studies. In the seventh canto Seth Bhagwandas Bagala of Churu visits the protagonist and implores him to establish a Sanskrit ''Paatshala'' (school) in Churu. Although hesitant at first, Harnamdutt is won over by the entreaties of the visitor and acquiesces. The chapter contains an excellent description of the desert environment\u2019s beauty. The eighth canto covers the grand welcome to the protagonist by the residents of Churu; the Sanskrit ''Paatshala\u2019s '' attracting students from afar and the spreading fame of Churu (Rajasthan) as a new Varanasi. The canto also describes the ideal perfection of a resident student\u2019s life. The ninth canto describes the misery caused by the famine of 1889, a prayer to Lord Shiva is organized and an unprecedented rainfall results. In the tenth canto the protagonist is accompanied by his sons and pupils on a pilgrimage. The poet describes both the hardships and blissful interludes which occur during travel through the desert. The travelers are waylaid by a band of brigands and the protagonist addresses them in a fearless manner. He advises the dacoits to become righteous warriors ([[kshatriya]]s). The eleventh canto is the heart and soul of the mahakavya. In it the protagonist instructs his sons to observe the requirements of nurturing a household ''(grihasta)''. The protagonist then proceeds to [[Haridwar]] and starts living as a hermit ''(vanprastha'') in the ''siddhashrama'' (hermitage). The twelfth canto describes the life of resident students at Gurukul Kangri, it also includes a listing of the protagonist's prominent students and collaborators. Next is a description of [[Kurukshetra]] where the protagonist proceeds to attend a conference of ''[[Brahmin]]s''. In the thirteenth canto the protagonist addresses the conference as the chairman, in his address he outlines the duties of a ''brahmin'' and enjoins the ''brahmins'' to carry out these obligations. The canto ends with a wish for world prosperity. In the fourteenth canto the protagonist opines that animal sacrifice has no place in a ''[[yajna]]'' (ritual offering) . In the fifteenth canto the protagonist attends a Sanskrit conference on the occasion of the ''[[Kumbha Mela#Timing|Kumbha parva]]'', the canto ends with an invocation for the propagation of Sanskrit. In the sixteenth canto we learn that the protagonist is in a sickly state and is being devotedly attended to by his pupils. The canto lists the disciples who followed in the footsteps of their [[guru]] by encouraging the growth of Indian culture. The ''mahakavya'' ends with a wish for Indian culture and traditions to be preserved eternally.<ref>Sarasvat p28-33</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*''Sahityasrashta'' Shri Vidyadhar Shastri at Library of Congress [http://lccn.loc.gov/84903009]\n*''Haranamamritam'' at Library of Congress [http://lccn.loc.gov/85910476]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars]]\n[[Category:People from Yamunanagar district]]\n[[Category:1843 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of British India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=February 2018}}\n'''Harnamdutt Shastri''' (1843\u20131915) <ref>[http://lccn.loc.gov/85910476 Library of Congress catlog]</ref> was a scholar of [[Sanskrit]] grammar, born in [[Jagadhri]] (in present day [[Haryana]]), India.

The ''mahakavya'' ends with a wish for Indian culture and traditions to be preserved eternally.<ref>Sarasvat p28-33</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*''Sahityasrashta'' Shri Vidyadhar Shastri at Library of Congress [http://lccn.loc.gov/84903009]\n*''Haranamamritam'' at Library of Congress [http://lccn.loc.gov/85910476]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars]]\n[[Category:People from Yamunanagar district]]\n[[Category:1843 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of British India]]\n", "name_user": "Paradoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "dab", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harnamdutt_Shastri"}

Over the next few years, talks began for the planning of a free public library. Carnegie granted $10,000 for the construction of the first public library. A special tax was used to purchase the site and to fund the maintenance of the building, which would be located on Osceola and Sunset. The building was designed by architect F.J. Kennard of Tampa, and G.A. Miller was awarded the contract for construction. Margaret Duncan was the first librarian (and then Library Director) appointed to the Clearwater Public Library. When Duncan left in 1918, the position was filled in 1920 by Grace Mease. By 1920, over half of the city's population were library cardholders. A few more staff were hired to support daily library duties and maintenance. The Depression years hit the library negatively as it did elsewhere; the resulting budget cuts were both necessary and devastating. When a $40 ceiling repair request was denied by the City Manager, the librarian purchased the supplies and paid someone to repair it for less than $14. The librarian was reimbursed by the City Manager for the expense.

It had been in several buildings before the expansion of nearby [[New York State Route 9H|NY 9H]] forced it to move a short distance west to its current building.

The two windows on either side bay have paneled green [[window shutter|shutters]].<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe east facade has a [[Palladian window]] topped by an attic vent. There are three evenly spaced windows on the north (rear) elevation. The west wing, slightly offset from the front, has three windows on the south side and one on the west with similar treatments to the front of the main block.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nInside, the main block has an open, vaulted ceiling. At its west end, lit by the Palladian window, is a fireplace and chimney breast with ornate [[molding (decorative)|moldings]] inspired by 18th century originals. The west wing is partitioned into two spaces. The front one is the children's room; the rear has most of the library's stacks.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe library began informally in the parlors of the nearby [[Rev. Dr. Elbert S. Porter House|Oakledge]] mansion sometime in the 1880s. Later it moved to an old stone house across what is now Route 9H from the current building. In 1891 it was formally organized as the Claverack Free Library and Reading Room Association.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThat organization soon bought the {{convert|1.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} lot where the current structure is located. An old store that had also served as a post office was converted into the first dedicated library building. It remained adequate for many years, but in the 1920s began to show its age.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nForty years later, in 1931, the state [[New York State Department of Transportation|Highway Department]] was planning to expand Route 9H, an eastern loop from [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] between Bell Pond to the south and [[Kinderhook, New York|Kinderhook]] to the north that avoids the city of [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]]. It would be necessary to [[eminent domain|condemn]] the library building, and after several months of negotiations the association accepted an offer of $5,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|5000|1932|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This would later rise to almost the full $7,800 it would cost to build the present library (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|7800|1932|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). The association turned to alumni of [[Claverack College]], closed 30 years earlier, to make up the difference. It rented space in several houses and other locations for the year it took to build the new library.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe association hired Hudson architect Lucius Moore to adapt a design from models sent to them by the state [[New York State Department of Education|Education Department]]. They selected a small [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] building that had been used, and built for a similar cost, by the library in the [[Long Island]] community of [[Bellport, New York|Bellport]]. The model was slightly adapted to be more consistent with local buildings from the Colonial era. The wideboard siding is beaded, as is the case on 18th-century Claverack houses, and the [[roof pitch]] steeper than the original design.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe first association meeting in the new library was held late in 1932, although the building was not yet quite finished. A thousand-dollar [[bequest]] from one local [[estate (land)|estate]] paid for the furnishings. Moore bought the bronze [[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s on the chimney in New York City at his own expense. The [[woodworking|woodwork]] was custom-milled for the library.\n\nSince its construction, the only significant alteration was the addition of the west wing in 1950. Moore was still practicing, and designed it to be completely sympathetic to the original building. The local [[Lions Club]] donated money for the lighting of the new wing.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n \n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Columbia County, New York]]\n*[[Mid-Hudson Library System]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://claverack.lib.ny.us/ Library website]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New York}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 1932]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Colonial Revival architecture in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1891 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Claverack, New York]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Columbia County, New York]]\n[[Category:Libraries established in 1891]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbia County, New York]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NRHP\n| name = Claverack Free Library\n| nrhp_type = \n| image = Claverack Free Library.jpg\n| alt = A small half-shaded white house-like building with green shutters and a white brick chimney\n| caption = Portion of south elevation, 2008\n| locmapin =\n| map_alt = \n| map_caption =\n| coordinates = {{coord|42|13|21|N|73|44|7|W|display=inline,title}}\n| location = [[Claverack-Red Mills, New York|Claverack]], [[New York (state)|NY]]\n| nearest_city = [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]]\n| built = 1932<ref name=\"NRHP nom\">{{cite web|last=Piwonka|first=Ruth|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Claverack Free Library|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=1543|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|date=January 1997|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>\n| architect = Lucius Moore<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n| architecture = [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]]\n| added = 1998\n| designated_nrhp_type = \n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| refnum = 97001624\n| mpsub = The Architectural and Historic Resources of the Hamlet of Claverack, Columbia County, New York\n| governing_body = Claverack Free Library\n}}\nThe '''Claverack Free Library''' is located on [[New York State Route 23B|NY 23B]] near the center of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Claverack-Red Mills, New York|Claverack]], New York, United States.

The front one is the children's room; the rear has most of the library's stacks.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe library began informally in the parlors of the nearby [[Rev. Dr. Elbert S. Porter House|Oakledge]] mansion sometime in the 1880s. Later it moved to an old stone house across what is now Route 9H from the current building. In 1891 it was formally organized as the Claverack Free Library and Reading Room Association.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThat organization soon bought the {{convert|1.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} lot where the current structure is located. An old store that had also served as a post office was converted into the first dedicated library building. It remained adequate for many years, but in the 1920s began to show its age.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nForty years later, in 1931, the state [[New York State Department of Transportation|Highway Department]] was planning to expand Route 9H, an eastern loop from [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] between Bell Pond to the south and [[Kinderhook, New York|Kinderhook]] to the north that avoids the city of [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]]. It would be necessary to [[eminent domain|condemn]] the library building, and after several months of negotiations the association accepted an offer of $5,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|5000|1932|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This would later rise to almost the full $7,800 it would cost to build the present library (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|7800|1932|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). The association turned to alumni of [[Claverack College]], closed 30 years earlier, to make up the difference. It rented space in several houses and other locations for the year it took to build the new library.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe association hired Hudson architect Lucius Moore to adapt a design from models sent to them by the state [[New York State Department of Education|Education Department]]. They selected a small [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] building that had been used, and built for a similar cost, by the library in the [[Long Island]] community of [[Bellport, New York|Bellport]]. The model was slightly adapted to be more consistent with local buildings from the Colonial era. The wideboard siding is beaded, as is the case on 18th-century Claverack houses, and the [[roof pitch]] steeper than the original design.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe first association meeting in the new library was held late in 1932, although the building was not yet quite finished. A thousand-dollar [[bequest]] from one local [[estate (land)|estate]] paid for the furnishings. Moore bought the bronze [[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s on the chimney in New York City at his own expense. The [[woodworking|woodwork]] was custom-milled for the library.\n\nSince its construction, the only significant alteration was the addition of the west wing in 1950. Moore was still practicing, and designed it to be completely sympathetic to the original building. The local [[Lions Club]] donated money for the lighting of the new wing.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n \n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Columbia County, New York]]\n*[[Mid-Hudson Library System]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://claverack.lib.ny.us/ Library website]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New York}}\n\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 1932]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Colonial Revival architecture in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1891 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Claverack, New York]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Columbia County, New York]]\n[[Category:Libraries established in 1891]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbia County, New York]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claverack_Free_Library"}
