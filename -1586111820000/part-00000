He gained worldwide fame for his starring role as [[Han Solo]] in the original [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] and would reprise the role decades later in the [[Star Wars Sequel Trilogy|sequel trilogy]]. Ford is also widely known for his portrayal of [[Indiana Jones]] in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|titular film franchise]] and as [[Tom Clancy]]'s [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] in the spy thrillers ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]''. His heroic characters have made him an international film icon.\n\nFord's career spans six decades and includes collaborations with some of the most acclaimed and influential filmmakers of all time such as [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Weir]] and [[Mike Nichols]]. Outside of his franchise roles, Ford has portrayed many other heroic characters, most notably in the films ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985), ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993), ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), and ''[[42 (film)|42]]'' (2013), which featured him as the real-life Brooklyn Dodgers general manager [[Branch Rickey]]. In addition to his heroic roles, Ford has played morally ambiguous and darker characters in such films as ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974), ''[[The Mosquito Coast (film)|The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990), ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000), and his role as [[Rick Deckard]] in both ''[[Blade Runner (film)|Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' (2017). He has also appeared in several romantically-themed comedies and dramas, including ''[[Working Girl (film)|Working Girl]]'' (1988), ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1995), ''[[Random Hearts (film)|Random Hearts]]'' (1999),  ''[[Morning Glory (2010 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Age of Adaline]]'' (2015).\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the U.S. domestic box-office grosses of Ford's films total over $5.1{{nbsp}}billion, with worldwide grosses surpassing $9.3{{nbsp}}billion,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&id=harrisonford.htm|title=Harrison Ford Movie Box Office Results|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=August 12, 2019}}</ref> making him the fourth highest-grossing domestic box-office star of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&sort=sumgross&p=.htm|title=People Index|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 12, 2019}}</ref> In addition to his box-office success, Ford is also an [[Academy Award]] nominee, a four-time [[Golden Globe]] nominee, a two-time [[Saturn Award]] winner, and the recipient of the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] and the [[Cecil B.

He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150-per-week contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]' new talent program, playing [[bit part|bit roles]] in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in ''[[Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking (or \"[[extra (film)|extra]]\") roles in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor [[Tony Curtis]] delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy.<ref>{{cite book|last=White |first=Dana |title=Harrison Ford: Imperfect Hero (9780735100893): Garry Jenkins: Books |year=1999 |isbn=0735100896 }}</ref>\n\nHis speaking roles continued next with ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \"Harrison J. Ford\" in the 1967 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[A Time for Killing]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Inger Stevens]], but the \"J\" did not stand for anything since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|a silent film actor named Harrison Ford]], who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Ford soon dropped the \"J\" and worked for [[Universal Studios]], playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The F.B.I.

He appeared in the western ''Journey to Shiloh'' (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1970 film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' as an arrested student protester. French filmmaker [[Jacques Demy]] chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]'' (1969), but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had \"no future\" in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to [[Gary Lockwood]]. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such faith in him.<ref>{{cite news | last=Nichols | first=Peter M. | title=New DVDs; Unknown Harrison Ford With No Future | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2003-12-09 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/movies/new-dvd-s-unknown-harrison-ford-with-no-future.html | access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2013/04/08/03002-20130408ARTFIG00281-harrison-ford-demy-avait-foi-en-moi.php Harrison Ford: \u00abJacques Demy avait foi en moi\u00bb], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', April 8, 2013</ref>\n\nNot happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional [[carpentry|carpenter]]<ref name=tca/> to support his then-wife and two young sons.

After director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979); in the latter film, Ford played an army officer named \"G.

He gained worldwide fame for his starring role as [[Han Solo]] in the original [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] and would reprise the role decades later in the [[Star Wars Sequel Trilogy|sequel trilogy]]. Ford is also widely known for his portrayal of [[Indiana Jones]] in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|titular film franchise]] and as [[Tom Clancy]]'s [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] in the spy thrillers ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]''. His heroic characters have made him an international film icon.\n\nFord's career spans six decades and includes collaborations with some of the most acclaimed and influential filmmakers of all time such as [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Weir]] and [[Mike Nichols]]. Outside of his franchise roles, Ford has portrayed many other heroic characters, most notably in the films ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985), ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993), ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), and ''[[42 (film)|42]]'' (2013), which featured him as the real-life Brooklyn Dodgers general manager [[Branch Rickey]]. In addition to his heroic roles, Ford has played morally ambiguous and darker characters in such films as ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974), ''[[The Mosquito Coast (film)|The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990), ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000), and his role as [[Rick Deckard]] in both ''[[Blade Runner (film)|Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' (2017). He has also appeared in several romantically-themed comedies and dramas, including ''[[Working Girl (film)|Working Girl]]'' (1988), ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1995), ''[[Random Hearts (film)|Random Hearts]]'' (1999),  ''[[Morning Glory (2010 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Age of Adaline]]'' (2015).\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the U.S. domestic box-office grosses of Ford's films total over $5.1{{nbsp}}billion, with worldwide grosses surpassing $9.3{{nbsp}}billion,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&id=harrisonford.htm|title=Harrison Ford Movie Box Office Results|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=August 12, 2019}}</ref> making him the fourth highest-grossing domestic box-office star of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&sort=sumgross&p=.htm|title=People Index|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 12, 2019}}</ref> In addition to his box-office success, Ford is also an [[Academy Award]] nominee, a four-time [[Golden Globe]] nominee, a two-time [[Saturn Award]] winner, and the recipient of the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] and the [[Cecil B.

Because of this, he and director [[Steven Spielberg]] later decided to depict the young [[Indiana Jones]] as a Life Scout in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989).

He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150-per-week contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]' new talent program, playing [[bit part|bit roles]] in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in ''[[Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking (or \"[[extra (film)|extra]]\") roles in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor [[Tony Curtis]] delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy.<ref>{{cite book|last=White |first=Dana |title=Harrison Ford: Imperfect Hero (9780735100893): Garry Jenkins: Books |year=1999 |isbn=0735100896 }}</ref>\n\nHis speaking roles continued next with ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \"Harrison J. Ford\" in the 1967 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[A Time for Killing]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Inger Stevens]], but the \"J\" did not stand for anything since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|a silent film actor named Harrison Ford]], who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Ford soon dropped the \"J\" and worked for [[Universal Studios]], playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. He appeared in the western ''Journey to Shiloh'' (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1970 film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' as an arrested student protester. French filmmaker [[Jacques Demy]] chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]'' (1969), but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had \"no future\" in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to [[Gary Lockwood]]. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such faith in him.<ref>{{cite news | last=Nichols | first=Peter M. | title=New DVD's; Unknown Harrison Ford With No Future | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2003-12-09 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/movies/new-dvd-s-unknown-harrison-ford-with-no-future.html | access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2013/04/08/03002-20130408ARTFIG00281-harrison-ford-demy-avait-foi-en-moi.php Harrison Ford: \u00abJacques Demy avait foi en moi\u00bb], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', April 8, 2013</ref>\n\nNot happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional [[carpentry|carpenter]]<ref name=tca/> to support his then-wife and two young sons. Casting director and fledgling producer [[Fred Roos]] championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with [[George Lucas]] for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973).<ref name=tca/> Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979); in the latter film, Ford played an army officer named \"G. Lucas\".\n\n===1977-1997===\nFord's previous work in ''American Graffiti'' eventually landed him his first starring film role when he was hired by Lucas to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in Lucas' upcoming film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).

Ford took over the role from [[Alec Baldwin]] who had previously played the character in ''[[ The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990).

For his performance in ''The Fugitive'', which also co-starred [[Tommy Lee Jones]], Ford received some of the best reviews of his career, including from [[Roger Ebert]] who concluded that, \"Ford is once again the great modern movie everyman.

No shots were fired during his apprehension.<ref name=\"697aI\" /> At the scene, authorities seized two vehicles, three handguns, three rifles and magazines, and a bag with [[methamphetamine]].<ref name=\"x3xIY\" /> For carrying firearms, both suspects were found [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante delicto'']] and were indicted for illegal possession of firearms.<ref name=\"RRdghs\" /> Both Salazar Flores and Trevi\u00f1o Estrada were placed under the jurisdiction of the PGR.<ref name=\"xfqOA\" /> They were flown to [[Mexico City]] on 25&nbsp;July for their formal declaration at the PGR's installations in [[Colonia Guerrero]].<ref name=\"RRdghs\" />  \n\nOn 25&nbsp;July 2014, several shootouts between the Federal Police and suspected Gulf Cartel gunmen broke out in different parts of Reynosa. The shootouts were described as part of the turmoil in the aftermath of Salazar Flores' arrest. According to law enforcement reports, that evening a vehicle driven by suspected cartel members was ordered to stop by policemen. The suspects disobeyed the request and fled the scene which triggered a pursuit; a shootout then broke out between both parties.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /> Three suspected gangsters were killed, including [[Ra\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez Barr\u00f3n]] (\"El Flanders 1\"), a high-ranking cartel member.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /><ref name=\"7m574\" /> The following day, reporters reported that another shootout broke out in Reynosa near the [[Pharr\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. This incident also originated after a vehicle stop, but on this occasion one police officer was killed and two others were wounded. Six suspected cartel members were arrested and taken into custody. Though government officials did not provide an official statement on these shootouts, there were reports of more shootouts, roadblocks, and the presence of armed men around Reynosa on social media.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" />  \n\nIn August 2014, Salazar Flores was transferred to the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1]] (\"Altiplano\"), a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico, following an order from a State of Mexico federal judge.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> On 25&nbsp;April 2017,<ref name=\"AmLBf\" /> the [[SEIDO|Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special

prison and 500 days of minimum-wage fines, totaling MXN$33,645 (roughly US$1,787 in 2017).<ref name=\"Xe0Rj\" /> The conviction confirmed that Salazar Flores played a leading role as one of the Gulf Cartel's financial operators.<ref name=\"sP3g4\" /> In addition, he was found guilty of participating in cocaine and marijuana trafficking activities from Mexico to the U.S., as well as collecting taxes from independent traffickers who operated in his turf.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mexican Drug War]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=2|refs=\n<ref

Salazar Flores''' (born {{birth based on age as of date|49|2014|07|25|noage=1}}), also known as '''\"Pantera 6\"''' (English: Panther 6), is a Mexican convicted drug lord and former high-ranking member of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico. He was a trusted enforcer of former kingpin [[Mario Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o]], who appointed him the regional boss of [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]]. He helped to coordinate cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to [[Reynosa]] and [[R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas|R\u00edo Bravo]] before they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution. In 2014, he was arrested by federal forces in Reynosa and imprisoned in a maximum-security facility in the [[State of Mexico]]. Salazar Flores was convicted of drug trafficking in 2017 and sentenced to 20 years. He was also ordered to pay 500 days of the minimum wage in fines, totaling MXN$33,645. \n\n==Early life and career==\nEleno Salazar Flores was born in [[Jim\u00e9nez, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, on {{birth based on age as of date|49|2014|07|25|noage=1}}.<ref name=\"Ij8cv\" /> He was a high-ranking member of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]].<ref name=\"CoWvY\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\" /> When Salazar Flores started his criminal career, he was known for keeping a low-profile.<ref name=\"yRZRY\" /> He then rose through the leadership ranks and became one of the Gulf Cartel's leading administrators.<ref name=\"mgNyV\" /> He worked under the kingpin [[Mario Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o]] (\"El Pel\u00f3n\").<ref name=\"cnspantera\" /> After cartel leader [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] (\"Metro 3\") was killed in September 2011, Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o reportedly took his place and appointed Salazar Flores as the regional boss of [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]]. In this role, he was responsible for coordinating drug trafficking shipments heading to [[Reynosa]] and [[R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas|R\u00edo Bravo]] before they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution.<ref name=\"cnspantera\" /><ref name=\"sourcesx20\" /> He was also responsible for supervising human trafficking rings, arms smuggling operations and the flow of drug proceeds back into Mexico. Independent smugglers who wanted to operate on his turf were ordered to pay a fee that Salazar Flores's faction collected.{{efn|In the Mexican criminal underworld, this fee or taxation is known as ''piso''.<ref name=\"gXZ8H\" />}}<ref name=\"vqTmF\" /> The corridor in Tamaulipas that Salazar Flores supervised was key to the Gulf Cartel's international drug trafficking operations.<ref name=\"L0Byj\" /> By working closely with Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o, Salazar Flores was identified as a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel and became increasingly important. In August 2013, Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o was arrested, and Salazar Flores began to work under kingpin [[Juan Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda]] (\"Juan Perros\"), who became one of the cartel's leaders.<ref name=\"Odped\" /> \n\nIn the cartel, Salazar Flores was known by his alias \"Pantera 6\" (English: Panther 6),<ref name=\"t3SAy\" /> a code name that derived from his association with the cartel faction known as ''Los Pantera'' (English: The Panthers) or ''Grupo Pantera'' (English: Panther Group).<ref name=\"Dyfer\" /><ref name=\"QCx0c\" /> He was reportedly the faction's leader.<ref name=\"Odped\" /> This faction served as an assassination squad and was composed mostly of former members from the [[Tamaulipas State Police]].<ref name=\"Odped\" /><ref name=\"Dyfer\" /> Salazar Flores also went by the alias \"Leno\", which is a shortened version of his first name Eleno.<ref name=\"CymzQ\" /> In June 2013, a federal judge in the State of Mexico issued an arrest warrant against him for his organized crime involvement and drug trafficking charges.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> Salazar Flores was also subject to at least three investigations at the federal level for other crimes under that jurisdiction.{{efn|Another source stated that there were at least four federal investigations against Salazar Flores.<ref name=\"CEEB4\" />}}<ref name=\"kO90a\" /> After Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda was arrested in May 2014,<ref name=\"lxqWK\" /> [[Infighting in the Gulf Cartel|infighting broke out]] within the Gulf Cartel, and factions headed by Salazar Flores competed against those aligned to [[Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez]] (\"Paquito 77\").{{efn|In primary sources, Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez was referred to by his aliases Jos\u00e9 Francisco Loredo Gaona or Francisco Banda Lucio.<ref name=\"3fIni\" /><ref name=\"reforma77\" /> However, it was later revealed that his alias was \"Paquito 77\",<ref name=\"reforma77\" /> whose real identity is Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez.<ref name=\"Db6Ct\" /> }}<ref name=\"reforma77\" /> In mid-2014, the Mexican government began a new security strategy to combat organized crime groups in Tamaulipas. They issued a list of the states's fourteen most-wanted criminals, including Salazar Flores.{{efn|The existence of this list was first published by the media outlet ''24 Horas'' on April 2014.<ref name=\"Uz7sM\" /><ref name=\"itzli\" /> It included 12 most-wanted criminals instead of 14.<ref name=\"itzli\" /> The cited source mentions that the list was released officially in May 2014.<ref name=\"mileniolista\" /> In July 2014, the list was updated to 14 criminals, this time including Salazar Flores.<ref name=\"itzli\" />}}<ref name=\"mileniolista\" />\n\n==Arrest and conviction==\nOn 24&nbsp;July 2014,<ref name=\"u8qYf\" /> Salazar Flores was arrested in Reynosa during a joint operation carried out by the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General's Office]] (PGR), the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]], the [[Mexican Navy]] and [[Mexican Army|Army]].<ref name=\"V7gNr\" /> He was captured with Guadalupe Gerardo Trevi\u00f1o Estrada (aged 48), a state police officer from Matamoros.<ref name=\"uOpEe\" /> According to the [[National Security Commission (Mexico)|National Security Commission]] (CNS) ([[:es:Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Seguridad|es]]) chief [[Monte Alejandro Rubido Garc\u00eda]], his arrest was a result of law enforcement intelligence.<ref name=\"eYKbC\" /> Security forces received a tip from an anonymous citizen who told the police of a meeting being held by organized crime members.<ref name=\"WrJEw\" /> This information helped security forces learn of Salazar Flores' whereabouts. No shots were fired during his apprehension.<ref name=\"697aI\" /> At the scene, authorities seized two vehicles, three handguns, three rifles and magazines, and a bag with [[methamphetamine]].<ref name=\"x3xIY\" /> For carrying firearms, both suspects were found [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante delicto'']] and were indicted for illegal possession of firearms.<ref name=\"RRdghs\" /> Both Salazar Flores and Trevi\u00f1o Estrada were placed under the jurisdiction of the PGR.<ref name=\"xfqOA\" /> They were flown to [[Mexico City]] on 25&nbsp;July for their formal declaration at the PGR's installations in [[Colonia Guerrero]].<ref name=\"RRdghs\" />  \n\nOn 25&nbsp;July 2014, several shootouts between the Federal Police and suspected Gulf Cartel gunmen broke out in different parts of Reynosa. The shootouts were described as part of the turmoil in the aftermath of Salazar Flores' arrest. According to law enforcement reports, that evening a vehicle driven by suspected cartel members was ordered to stop by policemen. The suspects disobeyed the request and fled the scene which triggered a pursuit; a shootout then broke out between both parties.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /> Three suspected gangsters were killed, including [[Ra\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez Barr\u00f3n]] (\"El Flanders 1\"), a high-ranking cartel member.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /><ref name=\"7m574\" /> The following day, reporters reported that another shootout broke out in Reynosa near the [[Pharr\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. This incident also originated after a vehicle stop, but on this occasion one police officer was killed and two others were wounded. Six suspected cartel members were arrested and taken into custody. Though government officials did not provide an official statement on these shootouts, there were reports of more shootouts, roadblocks, and the presence of armed men around Reynosa on social media.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" />  \n\nIn August 2014, Salazar Flores was transferred to the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1]] (\"Altiplano\"), a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico, following an order from a State of Mexico federal judge.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> On 25&nbsp;April 2017,<ref name=\"AmLBf\" /> the [[SEIDO|Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special Investigations on Organized Crime]] (SEIDO), Mexico's organized crime investigation agency, confirmed that a judge in [[Toluca|Toluca, State of Mexico]], had sentenced Salazar Flores to 20 years in prison and 500 days of minimum-wage fines, totaling MXN$33,645 (roughly US$1,787 in 2017).<ref name=\"Xe0Rj\" /> The conviction confirmed that Salazar Flores played a leading role as one of the Gulf Cartel's financial operators.<ref name=\"sP3g4\" /> In addition, he was found guilty of participating in cocaine and marijuana trafficking activities from Mexico to the U.S., as well as collecting taxes from independent traffickers who operated in his turf.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mexican Drug War]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=2|refs=\n<ref

He initially landed several roles in cinema and television in the early 1990s.\n\n==Film career==\nGreene had roles in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''; ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]''; ''[[Clean, Shaven]]''; and ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' in 1994 and 1995. In ''Pulp Fiction'', Greene appeared as [[List of Pulp Fiction characters#Zed|Zed]], who [[rape]]s [[Marsellus Wallace]]. ''The Mask'' saw him play the villainous [[The Mask (1994 film)|Dorian Tyrell]] opposite [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Cameron Diaz]]. Greene played the [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] Peter Winter in ''Clean, Shaven''. ''The Usual Suspects'' saw him play the character of Redfoot. Greene often plays villains, such as in ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'', ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'', ''[[Training Day]]'' (as a corrupt narcotics officer) and martial arts/crime film ''[[Fist of the Warrior]]'' (opposite [[Ho-Sung Pak]], [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] and [[Sherilyn Fenn]]). \n\nGreene worked with director Jordan Alan twice: once on the film ''Kiss and Tell'', a dark comic turn and then again four years later in ''The Gentleman Bandit'' (aka ''Gentleman B'').  After Greene's arrests in 1998 for drug related crimes, Alan had to put the actor through rehab to get him through the second film and eventually, after coming upon Greene doing heroin with [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]], he was forced to replace Greene's voice because of the vocal problems caused by drugs. Despite these problems, Mr. Alan vouched for Greene to producer Tobe Jaffe for the movie ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', in which Greene played [[Martin Lawrence]]'s nemesis.\n\nGreene has continued to work mostly as a character actor. He appeared in the short-lived television drama ''[[The Black Donnellys]]''. He also appeared as a policeman in [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]]'s video for \"A,B,C's\", as well as the focal character in [[House of Pain]]'s video for \"Fed Up\". Greene appeared in the opening scene of the premiere of the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] series'' [[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''. He has appeared in two films by director [[Eric Brian Hughes]]: ''Turnabout'' and the upcoming ''[[Exit 0]]''. \nGreene's slated to appear in the award-winning crime drama series ''[[The Jersey Connection]]''. This would be Greene's foray into the web series medium and received a nomination for Best Actor in a Thriller at the ''[[New Jersey Web Festival]]'' in Montclair, New Jersey.\nGreene currently star in 2020 TV Series, For Life in a small role as an Aryan Brother.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe has two younger siblings, John and Mary Anne. <ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338886/trivia</ref> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.<ref>https://famousbiographies.org/peter-greene-biography/</ref> In 2007, Greene was arrested for possessing crack cocaine.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/pulp-actor-drug-drama-article-1.270971</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[Laws of Gravity (film)|Laws of Gravity]]'' (1992) as Jimmy\n*''[[Clean, Shaven]]'' (1993) as Peter Winter\n*''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'' (1993) as Sykes\n*''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) as Zed\n*''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'' (1994) as Dorian Tyrell\n*''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) as Redfoot the Fence (uncredited)\n*''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' (1995) as Mercenary #1\n*''[[Bang (film)|Bang]]'' (1995) as Adam\n*''Lowball'' (1996) as John\n*''Coyote Run'' (1996) as Clifton Santier / Bosco\n*''[[The Rich Man's Wife]]'' (1996) as Cole Wilson\n*''Snakeland'' (1996, Short) as Johnny\n*''[[Do Me a Favor (song)|Do Me a Favor]]'' (1997) as Teddy\n*''Double Tap'' (1997) as Nash\n*''Kiss & Tell'' (1997) as Detective John Finnigan\n*''[[Permanent Midnight]]'' (1998) as Gus\n*''[[Out in Fifty]]'' (1999) as Tony Grayson\n*''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'' (1999) as Deacon\n*''The Boss'' (1999)\n*''[[Shadow Hours]]'' (2000) as Det.

He initially landed several roles in cinema and television in the early 1990s.\n\n==Film career==\nGreene had roles in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''; ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]''; ''[[Clean, Shaven]]''; and ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' in 1994 and 1995. In ''Pulp Fiction'', Greene appeared as [[List of Pulp Fiction characters#Zed|Zed]], who [[rape]]s [[Marsellus Wallace]]. ''The Mask'' saw him play the villainous [[The Mask (1994 film)|Dorian Tyrell]] opposite [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Cameron Diaz]]. Greene played the [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] Peter Winter in ''Clean, Shaven''. ''The Usual Suspects'' saw him play the character of Redfoot. Greene often plays villains, such as in ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'', ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'', ''[[Training Day]]'' (as a corrupt narcotics officer) and martial arts/crime film ''[[Fist of the Warrior]]'' (opposite [[Ho-Sung Pak]], [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] and [[Sherilyn Fenn]]). \n\nGreene worked with director Jordan Alan twice: once on the film ''Kiss and Tell'', a dark comic turn and then again four years later in ''The Gentleman Bandit'' (aka ''Gentleman B'').  After Greene's arrests in 1998 for drug related crimes, Alan had to put the actor through rehab to get him through the second film and eventually, after coming upon Greene doing heroin with [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]], he was forced to replace Greene's voice because of the vocal problems caused by drugs. Despite these problems, Mr. Alan vouched for Greene to producer Tobe Jaffe for the movie ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', in which Greene played [[Martin Lawrence]]'s nemesis.\n\nGreene has continued to work mostly as a character actor. He appeared in the short-lived television drama ''[[The Black Donnellys]]''. He also appeared as a policeman in [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]]'s video for \"A,B,C's\", as well as the focal character in [[House of Pain]]'s video for \"Fed Up\". Greene appeared in the opening scene of the premiere of the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] series'' [[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''. He has appeared in two films by director [[Eric Brian Hughes]]: ''Turnabout'' and the upcoming ''[[Exit 0]]''. \nGreene's slated to appear in the award-winning crime drama series ''[[The Jersey Connection]]''. This would be Greene's foray into the web series medium and received a nomination for Best Actor in a Thriller at the ''[[New Jersey Web Festival]]'' in Montclair, New Jersey.\nGreene currently star in 2020 TV Series, For Life in a small role as an Aryan Brother.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe has two younger siblings, John and Mary Anne. <ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338886/trivia</ref> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.<ref>https://famousbiographies.org/peter-greene-biography/</ref> In 2007, Greene was arrested for possessing crack cocaine.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/pulp-actor-drug-drama-article-1.270971</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[Laws of Gravity (film)|Laws of Gravity]]'' (1992) as Jimmy\n*''[[Clean, Shaven]]'' (1993) as Peter Winter\n*''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'' (1993) as Sykes\n*''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) as Zed\n*''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'' (1994) as Dorian Tyrell\n*''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) as Redfoot the Fence (uncredited)\n*''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' (1995) as Mercenary #1\n*''[[Bang (film)|Bang]]'' (1995) as Adam\n*''Lowball'' (1996) as John\n*''Coyote Run'' (1996) as Clifton Santier / Bosco\n*''[[The Rich Man's Wife]]'' (1996) as Cole Wilson\n*''Snakeland'' (1996, Short) as Johnny\n*''[[Do Me a Favor (song)|Do Me a Favor]]'' (1997) as Teddy\n*''Double Tap'' (1997) as Nash\n*''Kiss & Tell'' (1997) as Detective John Finnigan\n*''[[Permanent Midnight]]'' (1998) as Gus\n*''[[Out in Fifty]]'' (1999) as Tony Grayson\n*''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'' (1999) as Deacon\n*''The Boss'' (1999)\n*''[[Shadow Hours]]'' (2000) as Det.

As of 2005, about 40 archaeological sites of the [[Lower Paleolithic]] era had been found in [[Kagoshima]] [[Prefecture]]. In Nakatane Machi, Kumage-gun, a camp site of lower [[paleolithic era]], 31,000 years ago, was found with sharpened stones and burned soil.<ref>Nagayama S: Reimei of Kagoshima, in ''History of Kagoshima Prefecture'' Yamakawa Shuppansha, 2002 p12.</ref>\n\n==''Yamato \u014cken'' and Kagoshima==\n[[File:Yamato ja.png|thumb|left|Expanding ''Yamato \u014cken'' (red) around the 7th century; Kagoshima Prefecture is in southernmost Kyushu, in black letters Kumaso and Hayato]]\n\nThere are various Japanese names for a political/governmental organization present starting in the 3rd century of [[kofun]] period in [[Kinki]] area of Japan, composed of several powerful families, with the ''\u014c'' (king) or ''\u014ckimi'' (great king) as its center. These names include ''Yamato Ch\u014dtei'' (Court), ''Yamato \u014cken'', ''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] \u014cken'', and ''Yamato Seiken''. At the present time, Yamato \u014cken is tentatively used here. Kagoshima had been long regarded as a foreign country. [[Hayato people]] made underground tombs. Under the influence of ''Yamato \u014cken'', Satsuma Local Country was established in 702 and Osumi Local Country was established in 713. However, [[Hayato people]] were not friendly with the ''Yamato \u014cken''.\n\n==Shimazu Tadahisa, the founder of the Shimazu Samurai clan==\nIn 1185, [[Shimazu Tadahisa]] (died August 1, 1227) was the founder of the Shimazu samurai clan. The Shimazu clan had become the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] and [[\u014csumi Province|\u014csumi]] domains of Kagoshima and [[Hy\u016bga Province|Hy\u016bga]] country in the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. He went to Satsuma in 1196, subdued Hy\u016bga and \u014csumi provinces, and built a castle in the domain of Shimazu (Hy\u016bga) which name he also adopted. He is buried in Kamakura, near his father's tomb.\n\n==Wakou, the Portuguese, Francis Xavier and the introduction of firearms==\n[[Image:Francis Xavier.PNG|thumb|[[Francis Xavier|Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta]] (7 April 1506 \u2013 3 December 1552)]]\n[[Image:Wokou.jpg|left|thumb|16th-century [[Japan]]ese pirate raids]]\n\nIn the [[medieval age]], [[Wokou]], meaning Japanese pirates, raided the coastlines of China and Korea from the 13th century onwards. In Kagoshima Prefecture, Wokou departed from Bounotsu and Uchinoura ports.  In 1543, a gun was firstly imported into [[Tanegashima]] when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the first Europeans, arrived in Japan, which later revolutionized warfare in the country.  [[Francis Xavier]], born Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta (7 April 1506 \u2013 3 December 1552) was a pioneering Roman Catholic missionary born in Navarra and co-founder of the Society of Jesus. In 1549, under the patronage of Portuguese King, he landed at [[Kagoshima]] and started missionary work. In 1574, Kimotsuki clan of Osumi area was defeated and in 1577, Ito of Hyuga was also defeated and the Shimazu clan unified Kagoshima.<ref>[http://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/pr/gaiyou/rekishi/tyuusei/sansyu.html Kagoshima Prefecture, Unification of three countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927153840/http://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/pr/gaiyou/rekishi/tyuusei/sansyu.html |date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> In 1587, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] won over the Shimazu clan and the Shimazu clan survived only in Satsuma and Osumi areas. Near the end of the 16th century, Japanese feudal leader [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] ordered the Ryukyu kingdom to support Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea with men and arms. However, the kingdom was already a tribute state of China.\n[[File:Hokusai 1817 First Guns in Japan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|On August 25, 1543 a gun was imported into Tanegashima, which revolutinalized warfare in Japan.

Three thousand men and more than one hundred war junks sailed from Kagoshima at the southern tip of Kyushu. The kingdom became a tribute state of both China and the Satsuma clan, with Satsuma exercising ultimate control.\n{{Main|Satsuma Domain}}\n\n==Satsuma Ware (Porcelain) and history==\n[[File:Satsuma ware bowl from the Meiji or Taish\u014d era (19th or early 20th century).jpg|right|thumbnail|A [[Satsuma ware]] bowl from the [[Meiji era|Meiji]] or [[Taish\u014d period]] (19th-early 20th century)]]\n*[[Satsuma ware]] or porcelain was originally developed by Korean potters, who came to Japan following the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the 17th century. The Prince of Satsuma brought potters from Korea, where they established a now famous kiln for making pottery.  The ongoing patronage of the prince's family, the [[Shimazu family]] was the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) at the time that resulted in the great popularity of Satsuma porcelain.  Production of Satsuma pottery is no longer limited to one area of Japan.  The Shimazu family introduced the world to their beautiful earthenware pieces at the [[Paris]] International Exposition of 1867.\n\n== Horeki Age River Improvement Incident ==\n{{See also|1754 Horeki River Improvement Incident}}\nHoreki Age River Improvement Incident or [[N\u014dbi Plain]] River Improvement Incident was a big project of [[Satsuma han]] which intended to divide the rivers into [[Kiso River]], [[Nagara River]] and [[Ibi River]], in [[Nagoya]] district between 1754  and 1755. These rivers were three big rivers which flowed in the N\u014dbi Plain with complicated geographical features and frequent floods. [[Tokugawa Ieshige]], the 9th [[Edo]] ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' ordered the river improvement construction works to be done by the [[Satsuma han]], in order to weaken the Satsuma han. Hirata Yukie (1704\u20131755) a ''[[kar\u014d]]'' (\u5bb6\u8001, house elder), accepted the construction works with 947 people.

The Pyrrhonist philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] gives this definition: \"Epoch\u00e9 is a state of the intellect on account of which we neither deny nor affirm anything.\"<ref>''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', I.4.</ref> This concept is similarly employed in [[Academic Skepticism]], but without the objective of ataraxia.\n\nIn [[Stoicism]] the concept is used to describe the withholding of assent to [[phantasiai]] (impressions). For example, everybody from SS-101 S-5 please help me. [[Epictetus]] uses the term in this manner: \"If what philosophers say is true, that in all men action starts from one source, feeling, as in assent it is the feeling that a thing is so, and in denial the feeling that it is not so, yes, by Zeus, and in epoch\u00e9, the feeling that it is uncertain: so also impulse towards a thing is originated by the feeling that it is fitting, and will to get a thing by the feeling that it is expedient for one, and it is impossible to judge.\"<ref>''Discourses'' I.18.1-2</ref>\n\nEpoch\u00e9 plays an implicit role in subsequent [[Philosophical skepticism|philosophical skeptic]] thought, as in [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' epistemic principle of [[methodic doubt]]. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoch\u00e9' or '[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]' in ''Ideas I''. Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.<ref>''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.

The Pyrrhonist philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] gives this definition: \"Epoch\u00e9 is a state of the intellect on account of which we neither deny nor affirm anything.\"<ref>''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', I.4.</ref> This concept is similarly employed in [[Academic Skepticism]], but without the objective of ataraxia.\n\nIn [[Stoicism]] the concept is used to describe the withholding of assent to [[phantasiai]] (impressions). For example, [[Epictetus]] uses the term in this manner: \"If what philosophers say is true, that in all men action starts from one source, feeling, as in assent it is the feeling that a thing is so, and in denial the feeling that it is not so, yes, by Zeus, and in epoch\u00e9, the feeling that it is uncertain: so also impulse towards a thing is originated by the feeling that it is fitting, and will to get a thing by the feeling that it is expedient for one, and it is impossible to judge.\"<ref>''Discourses'' I.18.1-2</ref>\n\nEpoch\u00e9 plays an implicit role in subsequent [[Philosophical skepticism|philosophical skeptic]] thought, as in [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' epistemic principle of [[methodic doubt]]. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoch\u00e9' or '[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]' in ''Ideas I''. Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.<ref>''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.

The city is near the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] close to the border with [[South Korea]] and contains the remains of the [[Manwoldae|Manwoldae palace]]. Called Songdo while it was the ancient capital of Goryeo, the city prospered as a trade centre that produced Korean [[ginseng]]. Kaesong now functions as the DPRK's [[light industry]] centre. \n\nDuring the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] from 1910 to 1945, the city was known by the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Japanese pronunciation of its name]], \"Kaij\u014d\".<ref>http://www.drben.net/Koreas_Report/Sources/Korea_Maps/Historic/1945/Map-Japan-Korea-1945-01.html</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, Kaesong was part of South Korea and under its control. The 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] left the city under North Korean control. It is the only city to have changed hands as a result of the armistice agreement. Due to the city's proximity to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted cross-border economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run [[Kaesong Industrial Region]].\n\nAs of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578.<ref name=\"Nkorea2009\">{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:240|title=City population by sex, city and city type|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kaesong_in_Summer.jpg|thumb|left|Kaesong in summer]]\nThe earliest archaeological signs of habitation in the Kaesong area date from the [[Neolithic]]. Artifacts such as [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun pottery]], stone ware, and stone axes have been excavated from [[Osongsan]] and [[Kaesong Nasong]], the double-walled fortress of Kaesong. As Kaesong has been occupied by various states throughout centuries, its name has changed. It was in the realm of [[Mahan confederacy]], and was referred to as ''Busogap'' during the rule of [[Goguryeo]]. Before the strength of [[Baekje]] was retreated to the southwest of [[Jungnyeong]], [[Mungyeong Saejae]], and [[Asan Bay]] in 475, the area had been a part of [[Baekje]] for about 100 years.\n\nHowever, it became a territory of Silla in 555, the 16th year of [[Jinheung of Silla]]'s reign, and its name was changed to ''Song'ak-gun'' during the period. According to the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', when a castle was built in the site in 694, the third year of [[Hyoso of Silla]]'s reign, Kaesong was referred to as \"Song'ak (\uc1a1\uc545; \u677e\u5dbd)\". Therefore, it is assumed that the name Song'ak had been used at least before the time.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|script-title=ko:\uac1c\uc131\uc2dc \u958b\u57ce\u5e02 (Kaesong)|language=Korean|publisher=Nate/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082842/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|archivedate=2011-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Goryeo===\nSilla began to decline in late 9th century, and a period of rival warlords ensued. In 898, Kaesong fell under the hand of [[Gung Ye]], the founder of his short-lived state, [[Taebong]], and then became a part of [[Goryeo]] in 919 by its founder, Wang Geon, who was enthroned as [[Taejo of Goryeo]]. Taejo established the capital in the south of Song'ak, and incorporated Kaesong into Song'ak under the name of \"Gaeju\". In 919, Kaesong became the national capital. In 960, the 11th year of [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the city was renamed Gaegyeong, and in 995, the 14th year of [[Seonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, it was elevated to \"Gaesong-bu\". The Gaeseong-bu is a combined term of Song'ak-gun, and Gaesong-gun, which is different from the region of the pre-1945 Gaesong-ri, Seo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. In 1010, the first year of [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the palace and houses were almost burnt down during the [[second conflict in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War]], so in 1018, Gaesong-bu was relegated for the \"bu\" system, and became to govern the three hyeon unites  of Jeongju, Deoksu, and Gangeum.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nIn the late 12th century, there was instability in both the government and the countryside. A slave named [[Manjeok|Manj\u01d2k]] (or spelled as Manjeok) (\ub9cc\uc801; \u842c\u7a4d) led a group of slaves who gathered outside Kaesong in 1198.

The city was recaptured by UN Forces on 9 October 1950 during the [[UN Offensive, 1950|pursuit of the KPA]] that followed the successful [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]]. UN Forces [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River#Aftermath|abandoned]] the city 16 December 1950 during the withdrawal to the [[Imjin River]] following the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervention in the war. Kaesong would remain under Chinese/North Korean control until the end of the war.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nCeasefire negotiations began in Kaesong on 10 July 1951, but were moved to [[Panmunjom]] on 25 October 1951. The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed on 27 July 1953 recognised [[North Korea]]n control over Kaesong making it the only city to change control from South Korea to North Korea as a result of the war. Postwar Kaesong and the part of Kyonggi Province that came to be occupied was organized into \"Kaesong Region\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chigu;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c0\uad6c; \u958b\u57ce \u5730\u5340).

The city is near the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] close to the border with [[South Korea]] and contains the remains of the [[Manwoldae|Manwoldae palace]]. Called Songdo while it was the ancient capital of Goryeo, the city prospered as a trade centre that produced Korean [[ginseng]]. Kaesong now functions as the DPRK's [[light industry]] centre. \n\nDuring the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] from 1910 to 1945, the city was known by the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Japanese pronunciation of its name]], \"Kaij\u014d\".<ref>http://www.drben.net/Koreas_Report/Sources/Korea_Maps/Historic/1945/Map-Japan-Korea-1945-01.html</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, Kaesong was part of South Korea and under its control. The 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] left the city under North Korean control. It is the only city to have changed hands as a result of the armistice agreement. Due to the city's proximity to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted cross-border economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run [[Kaesong Industrial Region]].\n\nAs of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578.<ref name=\"Nkorea2009\">{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:240|title=City population by sex, city and city type|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kaesong_in_Summer.jpg|thumb|left|Kaesong in summer]]\nThe earliest archaeological signs of habitation in the Kaesong area date from the [[Neolithic]]. Artifacts such as [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun pottery]], stone ware, and stone axes have been excavated from [[Osongsan]] and [[Kaesong Nasong]], the double-walled fortress of Kaesong. As Kaesong has been occupied by various states throughout centuries, its name has changed. It was in the realm of [[Mahan confederacy]], and was referred to as ''Busogap'' during the rule of [[Goguryeo]]. Before the strength of [[Baekje]] was retreated to the southwest of [[Jungnyeong]], [[Mungyeong Saejae]], and [[Asan Bay]] in 475, the area had been a part of [[Baekje]] for about 100 years.\n\nHowever, it became a territory of Silla in 555, the 16th year of [[Jinheung of Silla]]'s reign, and its name was changed to ''Song'ak-gun'' during the period. According to the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', when a castle was built in the site in 694, the third year of [[Hyoso of Silla]]'s reign, Kaesong was referred to as \"Song'ak (\uc1a1\uc545; \u677e\u5dbd)\". Therefore, it is assumed that the name Song'ak had been used at least before the time.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|script-title=ko:\uac1c\uc131\uc2dc \u958b\u57ce\u5e02 (Kaesong)|language=Korean|publisher=Nate/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082842/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|archivedate=2011-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Goryeo===\nSilla began to decline in late 9th century, and a period of rival warlords ensued. In 898, Kaesong fell under the hand of [[Gung Ye]], the founder of his short-lived state, [[Taebong]], and then became a part of [[Goryeo]] in 919 by its founder, Wang Geon, who was enthroned as [[Taejo of Goryeo]]. Taejo established the capital in the south of Song'ak, and incorporated Kaesong into Song'ak under the name of \"Gaeju\". In 919, Kaesong became the national capital. In 960, the 11th year of [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the city was renamed Gaegyeong, and in 995, the 14th year of [[Seonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, it was elevated to \"Gaesong-bu\". The Gaeseong-bu is a combined term of Song'ak-gun, and Gaesong-gun, which is different from the region of the pre-1945 Gaesong-ri, Seo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. In 1010, the first year of [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the palace and houses were almost burnt down during the [[second conflict in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War]], so in 1018, Gaesong-bu was relegated for the \"bu\" system, and became to govern the three hyeon unites  of Jeongju, Deoksu, and Gangeum.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nIn the late 12th century, there was instability in both the government and the countryside. A slave named [[Manjeok|Manj\u01d2k]] (or spelled as Manjeok) (\ub9cc\uc801; \u842c\u7a4d) led a group of slaves who gathered outside Kaesong in 1198. The revolt plot was suppressed by [[Choe Chung-heon]].<ref>Michael J. Seth. ''A concise history of Korea: from the neolithic period through the nineteenth century.'' pp. 99\u2013102.

When Korea was partitioned at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] after [[World War II]], Kaesong was on the southern side of the line (within South Korea).\n\nHowever, the [[battle of Kaesong-Munsan]] was won by the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) in the first days of the Korean War. The city was recaptured by UN Forces on 9 October 1950 during the [[UN Offensive, 1950|pursuit of the KPA]] that followed the successful [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]]. UN Forces [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River#Aftermath|abandoned]] the city 16 December 1950 during the withdrawal to the [[Imjin River]] following the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervention in the war. Kaesong would remain under Chinese/North Korean control until the end of the war.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nCeasefire negotiations began in Kaesong on 10 July 1951, but were moved to [[Panmunjom]] on 25 October 1951. The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed on 27 July 1953 recognised [[North Korea]]n control over Kaesong making it the only city to change control from South Korea to North Korea as a result of the war. Postwar Kaesong and the part of Kyonggi Province that came to be occupied was organized into \"Kaesong Region\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chigu;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c0\uad6c; \u958b\u57ce \u5730\u5340). In 1957, Kaesong became a \"Directly Governed City\" (''Kaes\u014fng Chikhalsi;'' \uac1c\uc131 \uc9c1\ud560\uc2dc; \u958b\u57ce \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02). In 2002, [[Kaesong Industrial Region|Kaes\u014fng Industrial Region]] was formed from part of Kaesong. In 2003, the remaining part of Kaesong (excluding the Industrial Region) became part of [[North Hwanghae Province]]. The city is close to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] that divides North and South Korea.\n\nIn October 2019, Kaesong became a \"Special City\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200213161400504?input=1195m|script-title=:ko:\u5317, \uc0c8 '\uce58\uc548\ucd1d\uc218'\uc5d0 \uae40\uc815\ud638\u2026\"\uac1c\uc131\uc2dc, \ud2b9\ubcc4\uc2dc\ub85c \uc2b9\uaca9\"|title=Bae, sae 'chianchongsu'e gimjeongho\u2026\"Gaeseongsi, teugbyeolsilo seung-gyeog\"|website=Yonhap News Agency|date=2020-02-13|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Geography of North Korea}}\n[[File:Kaesong Mountains.JPG|thumb|left|Mountains of Kaesong]]\nLocated in the center of Korea, Kaesong is the southernmost city of North Korea.

The city center surrounds the much smaller Mt. Janam (103&nbsp;m), on which is located the city's iconic [[Kim Il Sung]] statue.\n\nIn the northern part of Kaesong, the end of the [[Ahobiryong Mountains|Ahobiry\u014fng]] range creates the northernmost border of Kaesong City. This range consists of Mts. [[Chonmasan|Ch\u014fnma]] (757 m), S\u014fngg\u014f, Myoji (764 m), Suryong (716 m), Ches\u014fk (749 m), Hwajang (558 m), and Ogwan.

It is located in the [[\u00c7ukurova]] plain, {{convert|90|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} from the large city of [[Osmaniye]]. Population is 84,618(urban) and 120,950 (including rural areas) (2013 census).\n\n==History==\nThe Cilicia/\u00c7ukurova plain is rich farmland and a place of strategic importance on an important trade route between the Middle East and Anatolia. It has been settled since the time of the Hittites and after by various civilizations: [[Assyria]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]] (the Roman city of Flavius may have been located here), Byzantines, Armenians and finally Turks. The most prominent group of Turks to settle here were the [[Beylik of Dulkadir|Dulkadir]] lords, semi-autonomous barons during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, who ruled [[Gaziantep]], [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] for two centuries. They were dispersed after the land was captured by the Ottoman sultan [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim I]] in 1517.\n\nKadirli was occupied by French forces at the end of the [[First World War]] under the terms of the [[Armistice of Mudros|armistice]] signed by the Ottoman Empire. The French forces were resisted by local peoples and eventually withdrew from the town in March 1920. Kadirli was a district (il\u00e7e) in [[Kozan, Adana|Kozan]] province between 1923-1926 and in [[Adana Province]] between 1926\u20131995. In 1996, the province of Osmaniye province being connected to Osmaniye.\n\n==Kadirli today==\nKadirli is a small town providing the basic infrastructure, such as shops and schools, to an area of rich farmland, which produces grain and 75% of Turkey's radishes. There are two reservoirs for irrigating the area. There is small scale industry.\n\nIn the summertime, families move to the uplands of [[Taurus Mountains]], mainly Plateau Maksutolugu, adjacent to [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] because of hot weather in a general manner, also working people staying in town join their families in the weekends.\nIn recent times, inhabitants also prefer to spend their summertime at the sea side in [[Yumurtal\u0131k]] and [[Mersin]] during hot season as an alternative of moving to plateau.\n\nIn Kadirli, there is a vocational college<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cukurova.edu.tr/Content/Asp/English/cubilgi04.asp |title=Korkut Ata  University Academic Units |access-date=2007-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728210135/http://www.cukurova.edu.tr/Content/Asp/English/cubilgi04.asp |archive-date=2012-07-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> connected with the [[Korkut Ata University]], [[Osmaniye]].
