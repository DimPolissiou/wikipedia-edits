Although WYD is designed for Catholics, it attracts sizable numbers of youths from other faiths and denominations and was presented as a multi-faith celebration of young people from all over the world.\n\nAs the event is ultimately an expression of faith, and a critical expression of faith is through service to others, World Youth Day 2002 had the support of some 25,000 volunteers; and some 100,000 pilgrims themselves spent three hours each on one of 750 service projects.\n\nThe groundswell of Catholic spirituality following World Youth Day 2002 in Canada led to the establishment of Canada's first national Catholic television network, [[Salt + Light Television]].

Jet and [[Gas Turbine|gas turbine]] ([[turboprop]], [[helicopter]]) aircraft engines typically use lower cost fuels with higher [[flash point]]s, which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle.\n\nThe first [[axial compressor]] jet engine in widespread production and combat service, the [[Junkers Jumo 004]] used on the [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Messerschmitt Me 262A]] fighter and the [[Arado Ar 234|Arado Ar 234B]] jet recon-bomber, burned either a special synthetic \"J2\" fuel or diesel fuel. Gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption.<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = | title = Summary of Debriefing of German pilot Hans Fey | publisher = Zenos' Warbird Video Drive-In | url = http://www.zenoswarbirdvideos.com/Images/Me262/ME262PILOTDEBRIEF.pdf | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures.\n\n==Standards== \nMost jet fuels in use since the end of World War II are kerosene-based. Both British and American standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of World War II. British standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lamps\u2014known as paraffin in the UK\u2014whereas American standards derived from aviation gasoline practices. Over the subsequent years, details of specifications were adjusted, such as minimum freezing point, to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels. Very low temperature [[Melting point|freezing points]] reduce the availability of fuel. Higher [[flash point]] products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce.<ref name=Rand2010/> In the United States, [[ASTM International]] produces standards for civilian fuel types, and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] produces standards for military use. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels.<ref name=Rand2010/> For reasons of inter-operational ability, British and United States military standards are harmonized to a degree. In Russia and former Soviet Union countries, grades of jet fuels are covered by the State Standard (GOST) number, or a Technical Condition  number, with the principal grade available in Russia and members of the CIS being TS-1.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Jet A ===\n\n[[File:Shell Refueller.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Jet A-1 refueller truck on the ramp at [[Vancouver International Airport]].

The one allowable additive is the chelating agent [[Salpn ligand|salpn (''N'',''N\u2032''-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-propanediamine)]].\n\nAs the aviation industry's jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5% of all refined products derived from crude,\nit has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene, a high-value product, by varying process techniques.\n\nNew processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes, the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the\nmanufacture of synthetic blend stocks. Due to the number and severity of the processes used, it is often necessary and\nsometimes mandatory to use additives. These additives may, for example, prevent the formation of harmful chemical species\nor improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear.\n\n==Water in jet fuel==\nIt is very important that jet fuel be free from water [[contamination]]. During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper [[air|atmosphere]]. This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel. The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2010.08.018 |last=Murray |first=B.J.|year=2011 |title=Supercooling of water droplets in jet aviation fuel |journal=Fuel |volume=90 |pages=433\u2013435 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> This was the cause of the [[British Airways Flight 38]] accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing.\n\nThere are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel. A visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water, as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance. An industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30&nbsp;ppm (parts per million) free water.<ref>[http://www.shell.com/home/content/aviation/products/shell_water_detector/ The Shell Water Detector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219150959/http://www.shell.com/home/content/aviation/products/shell_water_detector/ |date=2012-02-19 }}</ref> A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer.\n\n==Military jet fuels==\n[[File:US Navy 101117-N-9706M-326 Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Robert Loughbom inspects a sample of JP-5 jet fuel aboard the amphibious transport dock ship.jpg|thumb|A sailor inspects a sample of JP-5 jet fuel aboard an amphibious transport dock ship.]]\n\nMilitary organizations around the world use a different classification system of JP (for \"Jet Propellant\") numbers.

This technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required. Jet fuel is available in most places in the world, whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of [[general aviation]] aircraft. A diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine. However, very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities. Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today, even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the [[Junkers Jumo 205]] family had been used during the Second World War.\n\nJet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports, instead of diesel. The United States military makes heavy use of JP-8, for instance. However, jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel, thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine parts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use, or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its [[lubricity]]. Jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances.\n\nJet fuel contains more sulfur, up to 1,000&nbsp;ppm, which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  The introduction of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers. Pipeline diesels before ULSD were able to contain up to 500&nbsp;ppm of sulfur and were called Low Sulfur Diesel or LSD. In the United States LSD is now only available to the off-road construction, locomotive and marine markets. As more EPA regulations are introduced, more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production, thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel, as determined by ASTM Standard D445.\n\n==Synthetic jet fuel==\n{{main|Synthetic fuel}}\n[[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process|Fischer\u2013Tropsch]] (FT) [[Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene|Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene]] (SPK) synthetic fuels are certified for use in United States and international aviation fleets at up to 50% in a blend with conventional jet fuel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/D7566.htm |title=ASTM D7566 Standard specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons}}</ref> As of the end of 2017, four other pathways to SPK are certified, with their designations and maximum blend percentage in brackets: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA SPK, 50%); synthesized iso-paraffins from hydroprocessed fermented sugars (SIP, 10%); synthesized paraffinic kerosene plus aromatics (SPK/A, 50%); alcohol-to-jet SPK (ATJ-SPK, 30%).

Turbine engines (like [[diesel engine]]s) can operate with a wide range of fuels because fuel is injected into the hot combustion chamber. Jet and [[Gas Turbine|gas turbine]] ([[turboprop]], [[helicopter]]) aircraft engines typically use lower cost fuels with higher [[flash point]]s, which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle.\n\nThe first [[axial compressor]] jet engine in widespread production and combat service, the [[Junkers Jumo 004]] used on the [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Messerschmitt Me 262A]] fighter and the [[Arado Ar 234|Arado Ar 234B]] jet recon-bomber, burned either a special synthetic \"J2\" fuel or diesel fuel.

Both British and American standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of World War II. British standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lamps\u2014known as paraffin in the UK\u2014whereas American standards derived from aviation gasoline practices. Over the subsequent years, details of specifications were adjusted, such as minimum freezing point, to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels. Very low temperature [[Melting point|freezing points]] reduce the availability of fuel. Higher [[flash point]] products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce.<ref name=Rand2010/> In the United States, [[ASTM International]] produces standards for civilian fuel types, and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] produces standards for military use. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels.<ref name=Rand2010/> For reasons of inter-operational ability, British and United States military standards are harmonized to a degree.

The one allowable additive is the chelating agent [[Salpn ligand|salpn (''N'',''N\u2032''-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-propanediamine)]].\n\nAs the aviation industry's jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5% of all refined products derived from crude,\nit has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene, a high-value product, by varying process techniques.\n\nNew processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes, the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the\nmanufacture of synthetic blend stocks. Due to the number and severity of the processes used, it is often necessary and\nsometimes mandatory to use additives. These additives may, for example, prevent the formation of harmful chemical species\nor improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear.\n\n==Water in jet fuel==\nIt is very important that jet fuel be free from water [[contamination]]. During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper [[air|atmosphere]]. This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel. The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2010.08.018 |last=Murray |first=B.J.|year=2011 |title=Supercooling of water droplets in jet aviation fuel |journal=Fuel |volume=90 |pages=433\u2013435 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> This was the cause of the [[British Airways Flight 38]] accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing.\n\nThere are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel. A visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water, as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance. An industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30&nbsp;ppm (parts per million) free water.<ref>[http://www.shell.com/home/content/aviation/products/shell_water_detector/ The Shell Water Detector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219150959/http://www.shell.com/home/content/aviation/products/shell_water_detector/ |date=2012-02-19 }}</ref> A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer.\n\n==Military jet fuels==\n[[File:US Navy 101117-N-9706M-326 Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Robert Loughbom inspects a sample of JP-5 jet fuel aboard the amphibious transport dock ship.jpg|thumb|A sailor inspects a sample of JP-5 jet fuel aboard an amphibious transport dock ship.]]\n\nMilitary organizations around the world use a different classification system of JP (for \"Jet Propellant\") numbers.

This technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required. Jet fuel is available in most places in the world, whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of [[general aviation]] aircraft. A diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine. However, very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities. Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today, even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the [[Junkers Jumo 205]] family had been used during the Second World War.\n\nJet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports, instead of diesel. The United States military makes heavy use of JP-8, for instance. However, jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel, thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine parts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use, or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its [[lubricity]]. Jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances.\n\nJet fuel contains more sulfur, up to 1,000&nbsp;ppm, which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  The introduction of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers. Pipeline diesels before ULSD were able to contain up to 500&nbsp;ppm of sulfur and were called Low Sulfur Diesel or LSD. In the United States LSD is now only available to the off-road construction, locomotive and marine markets. As more EPA regulations are introduced, more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production, thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel, as determined by ASTM Standard D445.\n\n==Synthetic jet fuel==\n{{main|Synthetic fuel}}\n[[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process|Fischer\u2013Tropsch]] (FT) [[Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene|Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene]] (SPK) synthetic fuels are certified for use in United States and international aviation fleets at up to 50% in a blend with conventional jet fuel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/D7566.htm |title=ASTM D7566 Standard specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons}}</ref> As of the end of 2017, four other pathways to SPK are certified, with their designations and maximum blend percentage in brackets: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA SPK, 50%); synthesized iso-paraffins from hydroprocessed fermented sugars (SIP, 10%); synthesized paraffinic kerosene plus aromatics (SPK/A, 50%); alcohol-to-jet SPK (ATJ-SPK, 30%).

Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian's painting with a black cat, which traditionally symbolized prostitution.

Olympia was modelled by [[Victorine Meurent]] and Olympia's servant by the [[art model]] [[Laure (art model)|Laure]]. Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by [[Claude Monet]]. The painting is on display at the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]].\n\n== Content ==\nWhat shocked contemporary audiences was not Olympia's nudity, nor the presence of her fully clothed maid, but her confrontational gaze and a number of details identifying her as a ''[[Demimondaine|demi-mondaine]]'' or prostitute.<ref name=\"Smart History\" /> These include the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in stark contrast with her pale flesh, and her cast-off slipper underline the voluptuous atmosphere. \"Olympia\" was a name associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.<ref>[[T.

While the confrontational gaze of Olympia is often referenced as the pinnacle of defiance toward patriarchy, the oppositional gaze of Olympia's maid is ignored; she is part of the background with little to no attention given to the critical role of her presence.\n\nO'Grady points out that we know she represents '[[Jezebel]] and [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]]' \"and best of all, she is not a real person...\", rather she is object to the objectified and excluded from sexual difference according to [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theory.<ref name=\"The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader\" /> While Olympia looks directly at the viewer, her maid, too, is looking back.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94\u2013105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator}}</ref> In her essay \"[[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]], Sapphire and Their Homegirls: Developing an Oppositional Gaze toward the Images of Black Women\", Catherine West concludes that by claiming an oppositional gaze we can identify, criticize, resist and transform these and other oppressive images of Black women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Carolyn M|date=1 January 2008|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and their homegirls: Developing an \"oppositional gaze\" toward the images of Black women|url=https://works.bepress.com/DrCarolynWest/15/}}</ref>\n\n=== Events ===\nIn January 2016, a Luxembourg performance artist, [[Deborah De Robertis]], lay on the floor in front of the painting and  mimicked the pose of the subject, and then security guards closed the room and police arrested her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artist-arrested-again-for-nude-stunt-in-front-of-manets-olympia-in-paris-gallery-a6819886.html|title=An artist has been arrested (again) for a nude stunt in a Paris gallery|date=18 January 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Homages ==\n*''A Modern Olympia'', Paul C\u00e9zanne, c. 1873/74.\n*''Odalisque I.
