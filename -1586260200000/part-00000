He has argued that conventional economists are wrong to demand perpetual \"global balance\". His view is that all periods of economic growth are characterized by some form of symbiotic imbalance and that the focus should be on managing the distortions caused by the imbalance rather than forcing a return to some preconceived equilibrium. Therefore, his view is that the next round of global growth will only be sustained if the rest of the world can find a way to absorb waves of cheap capital emanating from China. This implies a return to global imbalances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etf.deutscheawm.com/AUT/DEU/Download/Research-Global/c6762d18-6b36-4911-9a0a-c2f08a899705/The-Wide-Angle.pdf |title=Global research |website=etf.deutscheawm.com |format=PDF}}</ref> According to an analysis by Sanyal in 2013, the UN's widely used population forecasts were flawed.

[[Florentine Codex]], late 16th century.]]\n'''[[Aztecs|Aztec]] cuisine''' is the cuisine of the former [[Aztec Empire]] and the [[Nahua peoples]] of the [[Valley of Mexico]] prior to European contact in 1519.\n\nThe most important staple was corn ([[maize]]), a crop that was so important to Aztec society that it played a central part in [[Aztec religion|their mythology]]. Just like [[wheat]] in much of Europe or [[rice]] in most of [[East Asia]], it was the food without which a meal was not a meal. It came in varieties that differed in color, texture, size and prestige, and was eaten as [[corn tortilla]]s, [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]es or ''\u0101t\u014dlli'', maize gruel. The other constants of Aztec food were [[salt]] and [[chili peppers]] and the basic definition of Aztec [[fasting]] was to abstain from these two flavors.\n\nThe other major foods were [[common bean|beans]] and New World varieties of the grains [[amaranth]] (or pigweed), and [[Salvia hispanica|chia]]. The combination of maize and these basic foods would have provided the average Aztec a very well-rounded diet without any significant deficiencies in vitamins or minerals. The cooking of maize grains in [[alkaline]] solutions, a process called [[nixtamalization]], significantly raised the nutritional value of the common staple.\n\nWater, maize gruels and ''[[pulque]]'' (''izt\u0101c octli''), the fermented juice of the [[century plant]] (''maguey'' in Spanish), were the most common drinks, and there were many different fermented alcoholic beverages made from honey, [[cacti]] and various fruits. The elite took pride in not drinking pulque, a drink of commoners, and preferred drinks made from [[Cacao bean|cacao]], among the most prestigious luxuries available.  Favored by rulers, warriors and nobles, they were flavored with chili peppers, honey and a seemingly endless list of spices and herbs.\n\nThe Aztec diet included a variety of [[fish]] and wild game: various fowl, [[pocket gopher]]s, [[green iguana]]s, ''[[axolotl]]s'' (a type of water salamander), a type of [[crayfish]] called ''[[acocil]]'', and a great variety of insects, larvae and insect eggs. They also domesticated turkeys, duck and dogs as food and at times ate meat from larger wild animals such as deer, but none of these were a major part of their diet.<ref>Smith, Michael Ernest, ''The Aztecs'' Wiley Blackwell, 2nd ed. 2002, {{ISBN|978-0631230168}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZNdwX8O9DUC&pg=PA63&dq=Aztec+diet+dogs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M9HRT4vfCYqZ8QPS75CiAw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Aztec%20diet%20dogs&f=false] p.63</ref> They ate various mushrooms and fungi, including the parasitic [[corn smut]], which grows on ears of corn. [[Squash (plant)|Squash]] (also known as ''[[cucurbita]]'') was very popular and came in many different varieties. Squash seeds, fresh, dried or roasted, were especially popular. [[Tomato]]es, though different from the varieties common today, were often mixed with chili in sauces or as filling for tamales.\n\nEating in Aztec culture could take on a sacred meaning, especially as evidenced in [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|ritual cannibalism]]. The act of eating another human was deeply connected to the [[Aztec mythology]], in which gods needed to consume the sacrificed flesh and blood of humans to sustain themselves, and the world. One way to look at this is that since human flesh was a food of the gods, it was sacred, and consuming sacred food could sanctify an individual and bring him or her closer to the gods. Further, certain warriors, in their afterlife, were believed to have been turned into butterflies and hummingbirds with the ability to fly back to the realm of the living to feed on nectar. From this, the importance the Aztecs ascribed to the act of eating is clear.<ref>Carrasco, 447-450</ref>\n\n==Meals==\nMost sources describe two meals per day, though there is an account of labourers getting three meals, one at dawn, another one at around 9 in the morning and one at around 3 in the afternoon.<ref>Coe,  111</ref> This is similar to the custom in contemporary Europe, but it is unclear if intake of ''[[Atole|\u0101t\u014dlli]]'', maize [[gruel]], was considered a meal or not. Drinking a good amount of the thicker kinds of ''\u0101t\u014dlli'' could equal the calories in several corn tortillas, and ''\u0101t\u014dlli'' was consumed on a daily basis by most of the population. Melina was a important Food in Aztec  \n\n===Feasts===\n[[Image:Aztec feast 5.jpg|300px|thumb|Aztec men at a feast. [[Florentine Codex]].]]\nMany accounts exist of Aztec feasts and banquets and the ceremony that surrounded them. Before a meal, servants presented fragrant tobacco tubes and sometimes also flowers with which the guests could rub their head, hands and neck. Before the meal would start each guest would drop a little food on the ground as an offering to the god [[Tlaltecuhtli]]. As military prowess was highly praised among the Aztecs, table manners imitated the movement of warriors. The smoking tubes and flowers went from the left hand of the servant to the right hand of the guest and the plate accompanying the smoking tube went from the right hand to the left hand.\n\nThis was an imitation of how a warrior received his ''[[atlatl]]'' darts and shield. The flowers passed out bore different names depending on how they were handed out; \"sword flowers\" went from left hand to right and \"shield flowers\" went from right hand to left. When eating, guests would hold their individual bowls filled with dipping sauce in the centre of the right hand and then dip corn tortillas or tamales (which were served from baskets) with the left. The meal was concluded by serving chocolate, often served in a [[calabash]] cup along with a stirring stick.<ref>Coe, 100-103</ref>\n\nMen and women were separated at banquets and, though it is not entirely clear from the sources, it seems as if only men drank chocolate.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The women would more likely have drunk ''pozolli'' (maize gruel from finely ground maize) or some type of pulque. Rich hosts could often receive guests sitting in rooms around an open courtyard similar to Middle Eastern [[caravanserai]] (or ''han'' in Turkish) and senior military men would perform dances. Festivities would begin at midnight and some would drink chocolate and eat hallucinogenic mushrooms so that they could tell about their experiences and visions to the other guests.\n\nRight before dawn singing commenced and offerings were burned and buried in the courtyard to ensure the fortune of the children of the hosts. At dawn, the remaining flowers, smoking tubes and food were given to the old and poor that had been invited, or to the servants.  As with all other aspects of life, the Aztecs stressed the dual nature of all things, and toward the end of the banquet the host would be sternly reminded by his elders of his own mortality and that he should not be overcome with pride.<ref>Coe, 74-81</ref>\n\n==== Domestic feasts ====\nAztec private feasts included music singing, storytelling, dancing, incense burning, flowers, tobacco, offerings, and gift-giving. Aztec feasts were a display of material culture and wealth, notes by Friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and Friar Diego Dur\u00e1n describe Aztec feasts as events where \"everything was to be created in abundance\". Feasts were organized to the point of ritual, there were roles and relationships displayed and reinforced. Hosts needed to meet the obligations of banqueting, in order not to \"offend\" their guests, and guests needed to reinforce the hosts' stature. There are multiple important events in Aztec society that called for feasts. Child naming ceremonies involved the ritual calling out of the baby's name and progressed into a large organized feast. This feast could consist of dressed bird or dog, meat and/or maize tamales, beans, cacao bean, and roasted chilli's.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIzcalli child presentation ceremonies were also important, part of the Aztec agricultural calendar. Izcalli was the last \"month\" of the calendar. Every fourth Izcalli celebration included the introduction of children, born during this four year period, to the Aztec community. This feast introduced the child to actions important to their religious life such as singing, dancing, ceremonial drinking, sacrificial bloodletting, and body modification. The food served during this feast was traditionally spicy. Noted by Sahagun was: \"And the sauce of the tamales was called 'red chilli sauce'. And when the good common folk ate, they sat about sweating, they sat about burning themselves. And the tamales stuffed with greens were indeed hot, gleaming hot.\" The wedding process also contained many ceremonies, the parents of a young male, when marriage was desired, had to ask permission of his ''calmecac'' school leaders. Part of this process was a feast of tamales, chocolate, and sauces. During the wedding itself, there were feasts of pulque, tamales, and turkey meat. Funerary feasts were also common among the wealthy class. Served at these feasts was octli (pulque), chocolate, bird, fruit, seeds, and other foods.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Public feasts ====\nParts of the 260-day ritual calendar of the Aztecs were ''[[veintena]]''. ''Veintena'' can be approximated as \"months\"; however, they are more aptly described as 20-day public ceremony periods. Each 20-day ''veintena'' was a full and complex festival made up of ceremonies dedicated to specific gods and deities of the current ''veintena''. Regional and local ceremonies differed in deities and methods from the official state-sponsored ones at Tenochtitlan. Food was an important part of ''veintena'' ceremonies; it was both consumed and adorned by priests. It was noted that during the ceremonies honoring ''Xipe Totec'' the priests would adorn themselves in arrays of \"butterfly nets, fish banners, ear of maize, coyote heads made of amaranth seed, tortillas, thick rolls covered with a dough of amaranth seeds, toasted maize, red amaranth, and maize stalks with ears of green or tender maize.\" In the ceremonies honouring ''[[Mixcoatl]]'', after a \"great hunt,\" Aztecs would feast on deer, rabbit, and all other animals killed in the hunt. Hunting was also important to celebrations dedicated to ''Xiuhtecuhtli'' when Aztec boys and young men would hunt for ten days. The products of these hunts would then be turned over to priests, who cooked them in large fire flies.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Food preparation==\nThe main method of preparation was boiling or steaming in two-handled clay pots or jars called ''xoctli'' in Nahuatl and translated into Spanish as ''olla'' (\"pot\"). Ceramics were vital to the cooking process and served at least three major purposes: [[Nixtamalization|nixtamal]] preparation, tamale steaming, and cooking beans, stews, and hot beverages.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 101</ref> The xoctli was filled with food and heated over a fire. It could also be used to steam food by pouring a little water into the xoctli and then placing tamales wrapped in maize husks on a light structure of twigs in the middle of the pot.<ref>Coe, 109</ref>\n\nTortillas, tamales, casseroles and the sauces that went with them were the most common dishes. Chili and salt were both ubiquitous and the most basic meal was usually just corn tortillas that were dipped in chilis that had been ground in a mortar with a little water. Dough could be used to encase meat, sometimes even whole turkeys, before cooking. In major Aztec towns and cities there were vendors that sold street food of all kinds, catering to both the rich and poor. Other than ingredients and prepared food every imaginable type of ''\u0101t\u014dlli'' could be bought, either to quench one's thirst or as an instant meal in liquid form.<ref>Coe, 149; 117-19</ref>\n\nWomen, in charge of domestic duties in Aztec societies, were also the cooks.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, p. 99</ref> Generally, men did not directly participate in cooking. Based on where cooking tools are usually found, it seems that kitchens were a simple, single-room structure separate from the house itself. Most cooking probably took place on a small triangular hearth in the kitchen.<ref name=\":0\">Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 100</ref>\n\n=== Kitchen tools ===\nMost information regarding Aztec cooking tools comes from finding the tools themselves, as depictions of the tools in art are rare, and when they are featured, they aren't particularly prominent or detailed. Luckily, tools were most often made of stone and ceramics and as such can be found in large quantities in good condition for study.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Manos'' and ''[[metate]]s'' were the tools of choice for grinding nixtamalized maize (nixtamal). It was also used to grind sauce ingredients like peppers, though different sets of manos and metates would likely have been used to avoid getting other flavors in maize dough ([[masa]]). The metate is a stone slab that can be slightly concave. Nixtamal was placed on top of the metate and the mano, effectively a rough cylindrical stone, was rolled over it, grinding the nixtamal. The mano and metate is a tool that would have been used every day, since ground nixtamal usually goes bad within a day. Ethnographies of 20th century indigenous communities seem to indicate that women could have spent between four and eight hours a day at a metate grinding nixtamal, but women in a 2007 study at [[Xaltocan, Tlaxcala|Xaltocan]] insisted that an experienced woman could grind all she needed for the day in only an hour; regardless, use of a metate for grinding is considered tedious work.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 102</ref><ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 108-109</ref> The mano and metate remained as the grinding tool of choice in central Mexico, as it tends to grind finer than European-style mills, and tortillas made from masa ground on a mano and metate are still considered of a higher quality, if much more labor-intensive.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 111</ref> However, some argue that the reason women used to and still do grind nixtamal by hand is because it was a way for men to limit the amount of free time women have in an effort to prevent extramarital affairs.<ref>Bauer, Arnold J. 1990. Millers and Grinders: Technology and Household Economy in Mesoamerica. ''Agricultural History'' 64 (1):1\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[molcajete]]'' is another grinding tool. It is a bowl made of porous [[basalt]] rock, and an accompanying basalt cylinder was used to grind foods into the molcajete. It looks and functions very similarly to a western [[mortar and pestle]]. The fact that a molcajete will hold whatever is prepared in it means it would have been ideal for preparing sauces that would spill off the sides of a metate, and molcajetes could also be used as serving vessels.<ref name=\":1\">Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 104</ref>\n\n[[Comal (cookware)|Comals]]<nowiki/> are a type of ceramic griddle with a smooth top and a porous bottom used for cooking various types of tortillas, as well as for non-maize foods like peppers and roasted squash. It is possible that comales could also have been used as makeshift pot lids for the sake of convenience.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere are several references to frying in the accounts of Spanish chroniclers, but the only specification of the Aztec type of frying appears to be some kind of cooking that was done with syrup, not cooking fat. This is corroborated by the fact that no evidence for large-scale extraction of vegetable oils exist and that no cooking vessels suited for frying have been found by archaeologists.<ref>Coe, 36</ref>\n\n==Foods==\n[[Image:Aztec spirulina.jpg|thumb|300px|Spirulina could be harvested off the surface of lakes with nets or shovels and was then dried as cakes which could be eaten with corn tortilla or as a condiment.]]\n[[File:Corn tortilla tlaxcalli Codex Mendoza Aztec glyph symbol.png|thumb|300px|This drawing is a remake of the [[corn tortilla]] [[Aztec writing|glyph]] found in the [[Codex Mendoza]]<ref>Mursell, I.

They harvested [[acocil]]s, a small and abundant crayfish of Lake Texcoco, as well as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] algae, which was made into a sort of cake called tecuitlatl and was rich in [[flavonoid]]s.<ref>Cowgill, George L. 2001. \"Central Mexico Classic.\" In Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 5: Middle America, edited by Peter N. Peregrine and Melvin Ember, 25. Boston, MA: Springer US. doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-0525-9_2.</ref> Although the Aztecs' diet was mostly vegetarian, the Aztecs consumed insects such as [[chapulines|grasshoppers]] ''chapul\u00edn'' {{IPA-nah|t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8polin|}} (singular) or ''chapulines'' {{IPA-nah|t\u0361\u0283apo\u02c8lime\u0294|}} ([[plural]]), [[maguey worm]], ants, larvae, etc. Insects have a higher protein content than meat, and even now they are considered a delicacy in some parts of Mexico.<ref>Ortiz de Montellano, 102-106</ref>\n\n===Cereals===\n[[Image:Blowing on maize.jpg|thumb|300px|An Aztec woman blowing on maize before putting in the cooking pot, so that it will not \"fear the fire\". [[Florentine Codex]], late 16th century.]]\n\n[[Maize]] was the single most important staple of the Aztecs. It was consumed at every meal by all social classes, and played a central role in Aztec mythology. To some of the first Europeans, the Aztecs described maize as \"precious, our flesh, our bones\".<ref>Coe, 89</ref> It came in a vast number of varieties of various sizes, shapes and colors; yellow, reddish, white with stripes of color, black, with or without speckles and a blue-husked variant that was considered to be particularly precious. Other local and regional varieties must have also existed but few were recorded. Maize was revered to such an extent that women blew on maize before putting it into the cooking pot so that it would not fear the fire, and any maize that was dropped on the ground was picked up rather than being wasted. One of the Aztec informants of the Spanish Franciscan missionary and chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] explained the practice in the following way:\n\n{{quote|Our sustenance suffers, it lies weeping. If we should not gather it up, it would accuse us before our Lord. It would say: O our Lord, this vassal picked me not up when I lay scattered on the ground. Punish him. Or perhaps we should starve.<ref>Quoted in Coe, 88</ref>}}\n\nA process called [[nixtamalization]] was used all over America where maize was the staple. The word is a compound of the [[Nahuatl]] words ''nextli'' (\"ashes\") and ''tamalli'' (\"unformed corn dough; [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]\"), and the process is still in use today. Dry maize grain is soaked and cooked in an [[alkaline]] solution, usually [[limewater]]. This releases the [[pericarp]], the outer hull of the grains and makes the maize easier to grind. The process transforms maize from a simple source of [[carbohydrate]]s into a considerably more complete nutritional package; it increases the amount of [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] that are added through the alkalide or the vessel used in the process and [[niacin]], [[riboflavin]] and more [[protein]] already present in the corn that is not digestible to humans are made available through the process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Cambridge World History of Food'', 108-110</ref>\n\nThe inhibited growth of certain [[mycotoxins]] (toxic fungi) is another benefit of nixtamalization. If the processed maize, the ''nextamalli'', is allowed to ferment, further nutrients, including [[amino acid]]s such as [[lysine]] and [[tryptophan]] are made available. Together with beans, vegetables, fruit, chilis and salt nixtamalized corn can form a healthy and diverse diet.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Spices===\nA great number of herbs and spices were available to the Aztecs in seasoning food. Among the most important, [[chili peppers]] come in a wide variety of species and cultivars, some domesticated and many of them wild. These included a great range of heat intensity depending on the amount of capsaicin present, with some being mild and others being very piquant. The chilis were often dried and ground for storage and use in cooking, some roasted beforehand to impart different tastes. Flavors varied significantly from one type to another, including sweet, fruity, earthy, smoky, and fiery hot.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bosland|first=Paul|year=1999|title=Chiles: A Gift from a Fiery God|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/|journal=HortScience|volume=34 |issue=5|pages=810|via=}}</ref>\n\nNative species of plants used as seasonings produced flavors similar to Old World spices that often proved to be more easily accessible in cooking after the Spanish conquest. [[Culantro]] or Mexican coriander provides a much stronger flavor than its Old World parallel, cilantro, and its leaves can be easier to dry. [[Mexican oregano]] and Mexican anise likewise produce flavors reminiscent of their Mediterranean counterparts, while [[allspice]] has an aroma somewhere in between nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.\n\nThe bark of [[canella]] or white cinnamon has a soft, delicate flavor that might have eased the acceptance of the more pungent cinnamon of Ceylon into modern Mexican cuisine. Before the arrival of onions and garlic, subtler but similar wild plants such as Kunth's onion and other southern-ranging species of the genus ''[[Allium]]'', as well as the fragrant leaves of [[garlic vine]] may have been appropriated. Other flavorings available included [[mesquite]], [[vanilla]], [[achiote]], [[epazote]], [[hoja santa]], [[Plagiobothrys|popcorn flower]], [[avocado]] leaf, and other indigenous plants.\n\n==Drink==\n[[Image:Aztec5figure9.jpg|300px|thumb|A painting from [[Codex Mendoza]] showing an elderly Aztec woman drinking pulque.]]\n\n=== Alcohol ===\nMany different alcoholic beverages were made from fermented maize, honey, pineapple, cactus fruit and other plants. The most common was ''octli'' which was made from [[Century plant|maguey]] sap. It is today known as [[pulque]], an [[Antilles|Antillean]] term. It was drunk by all social classes, though some nobles made a point of not downing such a humble beverage. Drinking was tolerated, even for children at some occasions, but becoming intoxicated was not. The penalties could be very stiff, and were stricter for the elite.<ref>Coe, 84-87</ref>\n\nThe first transgression of a commoner would be punished by tearing his house down and sending him off to live in the field like an animal. A noble would generally not get a second chance and could be executed for overindulging in alcohol. Getting intoxicated appeared to have been more tolerated for elderly people; Spanish translations of the Codex Mendoza note that there were specific circumstances that allowed the elderly to get intoxicated: \n\n<blockquote>It is shown how, according to the laws and customs of the lose of seventy years of age, man or woman, if such old persons had children or grandchildren. These had license and freedom to use it.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nThis did not prevent the occasional tragedy of nobles who became alcoholics and drank themselves into poverty, squalor and an early death. An informant of Sahag\u00fan told the sad story of a former [[tlacateccatl]], a general and commander of over 8,000 troops:\n\n{{quote|He drank up all his land; he sold it all ... Tlacateccatl, a valiant warrior, a great warrior, and a great nobleman, sometimes, somewhere on the road where there was travel, lay fallen, drunk, wallowing in ordure.<ref>Quoted in Coe, 85</ref>}}\n\n===''\u0100t\u014dle''===\n''\u0100t\u014dle'' ({{IPA-nah|a\u02d0\u02c8to\u02d0l\u02d0i|}}), maize gruel, accounted for a considerable amount of the daily calorie intake. The basic recipe for ''\u0101t\u014dle'' was eight parts water and six parts maize with lime that was cooked until it softened and then ground. The mixture was then boiled until it thickened. There were many variations of ''\u0101t\u014dle'': a mixture of 1/10 maguey syrup made ''nequ\u0101t\u014dle''; adding chili ground with salt and tomato would make ''iztac \u0101t\u014dle''; letting maize dough sour for 4\u20135 days and then adding more fresh dough with chili and salt would make ''xoco\u0101t\u014dle''. Beans, baked corn tortillas with the crust cut off, toasted maize, chia, amaranth and honey could also be added and there was ''pinolli'', ground toasted maize that was carried by travelers in sacks which could be mixed with water on the road for an instant meal.<ref>Coe, 117-118</ref>\n\n===Cacao===\nCacao had immense symbolic value. It was a rare luxury and an import that could not be grown within the boundaries of the [[Aztec Empire]]. There are no detailed descriptions of how cacao solids were prepared, but there are a number of allusions to the fact that it was eaten in some form. Cacao beans were among the most valuable commodities and could be used as a form of payment, although of somewhat low value; 80-100 beans could be used to buy a small mantle or a canoe-full of fresh water if one lived on the salty part of the lakes around Tenochtitlan. Nevertheless, beans were frequently counterfeited by filling empty cacao shells with dirt or mud.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|last=Civitello|first=Linda|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-41195-7|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=112|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nCacao was commonly drunk as ''cacahuatl'', \"cacao water\",<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sophie D.

It was considered a potent intoxicant and something that was drunk with great solemnity and gravity and was described as something \"not drunk unthinkingly\" by the Spanish chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan|Sahag\u00fan]]. Chocolate could be prepared in a huge variety of ways and most of them involved mixing hot or tepid water with toasted and ground cacao beans, maize and any number of flavorers such as chili, honey, vanilla and a wide variety of spices.<ref>The full list of cacao flavorers is very extensive, but some of the common ones were ''uei nacaztli'' (''[[Cymbopetalum penduliflorum]]''); ''teonacaztli'' (''[[Chiranthodendron pentadactylon]]''), which had the flavor of \"black pepper with a resinous bitterness\" and was commonly used at banquets; ''mecaxochitl'' (''[[Piper amalgo]]''), a relation of [[black pepper]]; ''yolloxochitl'' (the flower of ''[[Magnolia mexicana]]'') which had the taste of ripe [[melon]]; ''piztle'' (the seeds of ''[[Calocarpum mammosum]]''<!-- this is now either Manilkara zapota (C. mammosum Pierre) or Pouteria sapota (C. mammosum auct. non Pierre) -->), with the flavor of bitter [[almond]]s; ''pochotl'' (the seeds of Ceipa spp.), described as \"sweet and tasty\"; and [[allspice]]. One of the most common recipes consisted of ''mecaxochitl'', ''uei nacaztli'', vanilla, softened maize and cacao mixed with tepid water, and was drunk immediately after preparation.</ref>\n\nThe ingredients were mixed and beaten with a beating stick or aerated by pouring the chocolate from one vessel to another. If the cacao was of high quality, this produced a rich head of foam. The head could be set aside, the drink further aerated to produce another head, which was also set aside and then placed on top of the drink along with the rest of the foam before serving.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/truehistoryofcho0000coes|url-access=registration|title=The True History of Chocolate|last=Coe|first=Sophie Dobzhansky|last2=Coe|first2=Michael D.|date=2007|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=9780500286968|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/truehistoryofcho0000coes/page/86 86]\u201387|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Dietary norms==\nThe Aztecs stressed moderation in all aspects of life. European authors and chroniclers were often impressed by what they perceived as exemplary frugality, simplicity and moderation. [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]], the bishop of [[Puebla]] and viceroy of [[New Spain]] in the 1640s reported:\n\n{{quote|I have seen them eat with great deliberation, silence, and modesty, so that one knows that the patience shown in all of their habits is shown in eating as well, and they do not allow themselves to be rushed by hunger or the urge to satisfy it.<ref>Quoted in Coe, 83</ref>}}\n\n===Fasting===\nThe primary meaning of an Aztec fast was to abstain from salt and chilis and all members of Aztec society engaged in fasting to some extent. There were no regular exceptions from the fast, something that shocked the first Europeans who came into contact with the Aztecs. Though fasting was common in Europe, there were permanent exceptions for the women and small children, the sick or frail and the elderly. Before the New Fire ceremony, which occurred every 52 years, some priests fasted for a whole year; the other priests 80 days and lords 8 days.<ref name=\"Coe, 83-84\">Coe, 83-84</ref>\n\nCommoners engaged in fasts, but less rigorously. There was also a permanent contingent of fasters in [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuacan]]. Along with various ascetic rigors like sleeping on a stone pillow, they fasted for periods of four years on one 50-gram corn tortilla (about 2 ounces) per day. The only respite came every 20 days, when they were allowed to eat whatever they wanted.<ref name=\"Coe, 83-84\"/>\n\nEven rulers such as [[Moctezuma]]{{dn|date=November 2019}} were expected to cut down on their otherwise luxurious lifestyle and did so with considerable conviction and effort. At times he abstained from luxuries and sex with women and ate only cakes of ''michihuauhtli'' and seeds of [[amaranth]] or [[Chenopodium|goosefoot]]. The lord's chocolate was also replaced with water mixed from parched bean powder. This can be contrasted with the fasts of many European nobles and clergy that, while obeying the letter of the religious regulation by replacing meat and animal products with fish, were still luxurious feasts in their own right.<ref>Coe, 70</ref>\n\nDuring the fourteenth month, called [[Quecholli]], ceremonies in honor of the hunting god [[Mixcoatl]] there would be a large hunt as part of the ritual. To prepare for the hunt Aztecs would fast for five days. The fasting was done, according to Sahagun, \"for the deer, so that it would be a successful hunt.\"\n\nDuring the celebrations of the god [[Tezcatlipoca]], his priests fasted for ten, five, or seven days continuously before the main feasts. They were known as \"those who do penance.\"\n\nDuring celebrations of [[Hu\u012btzil\u014dp\u014dchtli|Huitzilopoctli]] it was noted by Friar Duran: \"I have been assured that they became so weak because of the terrible eight-day fast that for another eight days they were not themselves, nor were they satisfied with eating. Many became gravely ill, and the lives of many pregnant women were in danger.\"\n\nDuring festivals in honor of [[Chicomec\u014d\u0101tl|Chicomecoatl]], there would be a drastic back and forth of gorging and fasting. So much so that people would become ill.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sacred consumption: food and ritual in Aztec art and culture|last=Mor\u00e1n|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Food and politics ==\nBernal Diaz del Castillo comments on how the ruler of Tenochtitlan was served food:\n\n<blockquote>His cooks had more than thirty styles of dishes made according to their fashion and usage, and they put them on small low clay braziers so that they would not get cold ... if it was cold they made him a fire of glowing coals made from the bark of certain trees ... the odor of the bark ... was most fragrant ... they put the tablecloths of white fabric ... They served him on Cholula pottery, some red and some black ... and from time to time they brought him some cups of fine gold, with a certain drink made of cacao.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nSahagun provides a list of the different types of tlaquetzalli, a chocolate drink served to Aztec lords: \n\n<blockquote>The ruler was served his chocolate, with which he finished [his repast] - green, made of tender cacao; honeyed chocolate made with ground-up dried flowers - with green vanilla pods; bright red chocolate; orange-colored chocolate; rose-colored chocolate; black chocolate; white chocolate.\"<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nAztec expansion was targeted in ways to gain or maintain access to foodstuffs need for ceremony and everyday life. The leader's ability to acquire food needed for ritual was important for his political success.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Cannibalism==\n{{main|Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America}}\n\n[[File:Magliabchanopage 73r.jpg|300px|thumb|A scene depicting ritualistic cannibalism being practiced in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]], folio 73r.]]\nThe Aztecs practiced ritualistic [[cannibalism]]. Victims, usually prisoners of war, were sacrificed in public on top of temples and pyramids by cutting out their hearts. The bodies were then thrown down to the ground where they were dismembered. The pieces were then distributed to the elite, which were mostly warriors and priests. The meat was consumed in the form of stews flavored only with salt and eaten with corn tortillas, but without the otherwise ubiquitous chili.<ref name=\"Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86\">Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86</ref>\n\nThe veintena [[Xipe Totec#Annual festival|Tlacaxipehualiztli]] was one of intense human sacrifice, it was noted by Sahagun that \"it was the time when all captives died, all those taken, all those who were made captive, the men, the women, all the children.\" It began with the sacrifice of captured warriors, the flesh of the sacrificed warriors would be taken to the residence of the Aztec who had captured the warrior. The capturer was forbidden to feast on the flesh of the sacrificed, however his family would eat it. A stew called [[Pozole|tlacatlaolli]] was prepared out of dried maize and into each serving would be placed a piece of the flesh of the captive.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s the anthropologist [[Michael Harner]] suggested that the Aztecs had resorted to large-scale, organized cannibalism to make up for a supposed [[protein]] deficiency in the diet. This idea gained limited support from some scholars, but has been shown to be based on unfounded assumptions about eating habits, agriculture and demographics, making it a highly unlikely scenario.<ref name=\"Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Mesoamerica|Food|History}}\n* [[Mexican cuisine]]\n* [[Maya cuisine]]\n* [[Moctezuma's Table]]\n* [[Muisca cuisine]]\n* [[Inca cuisine]]\n* [[Domesticated plants of Mesoamerica]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Bosland, Paul.

[[Florentine Codex]], late 16th century.]]\n'''[[Aztecs|Aztec]] cuisine''' is the cuisine of the former [[Aztec Empire]] and the [[Nahua peoples]] of the [[Valley of Mexico]] prior to European contact in 1519.\n\nThe most important staple was corn ([[maize]]), a crop that was so important to Aztec society that it played a central part in [[Aztec religion|their mythology]]. Just like [[wheat]] in much of Europe or [[rice]] in most of [[East Asia]], it was the food without which a meal was not a meal. It came in varieties that differed in color, texture, size and prestige, and was eaten as [[corn tortilla]]s, [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]es or ''\u0101t\u014dlli'', maize gruel. The other constants of Aztec food were [[salt]] and [[chili peppers]] and the basic definition of Aztec [[fasting]] was to abstain from these two flavors.\n\nThe other major foods were [[common bean|beans]] and New World varieties of the grains [[amaranth]] (or pigweed), and [[Salvia hispanica|chia]]. The combination of maize and these basic foods would have provided the average Aztec a very well-rounded diet without any significant deficiencies in vitamins or minerals. The cooking of maize grains in [[alkaline]] solutions, a process called [[nixtamalization]], significantly raised the nutritional value of the common staple.\n\nWater, maize gruels and ''[[pulque]]'' (''izt\u0101c octli''), the fermented juice of the [[century plant]] (''maguey'' in Spanish), were the most common drinks, and there were many different fermented alcoholic beverages made from honey, [[cacti]] and various fruits. The elite took pride in not drinking pulque, a drink of commoners, and preferred drinks made from [[Cacao bean|cacao]], among the most prestigious luxuries available.  Favored by rulers, warriors and nobles, they were flavored with chili peppers, honey and a seemingly endless list of spices and herbs.\n\nThe Aztec diet included a variety of [[fish]] and wild game: various fowl, [[pocket gopher]]s, [[green iguana]]s, ''[[axolotl]]s'' (a type of water salamander), a type of [[crayfish]] called ''[[acocil]]'', and a great variety of insects, larvae and insect eggs. They also domesticated turkeys, duck and dogs as food and at times ate meat from larger wild animals such as deer, but none of these were a major part of their diet.<ref>Smith, Michael Ernest, ''The Aztecs'' Wiley Blackwell, 2nd ed. 2002, {{ISBN|978-0631230168}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZNdwX8O9DUC&pg=PA63&dq=Aztec+diet+dogs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M9HRT4vfCYqZ8QPS75CiAw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Aztec%20diet%20dogs&f=false] p.63</ref> They ate various mushrooms and fungi, including the parasitic [[corn smut]], which grows on ears of corn. [[Squash (plant)|Squash]] (also known as ''[[cucurbita]]'') was very popular and came in many different varieties. Squash seeds, fresh, dried or roasted, were especially popular. [[Tomato]]es, though different from the varieties common today, were often mixed with chili in sauces or as filling for tamales.\n\nEating in Aztec culture could take on a sacred meaning, especially as evidenced in [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|ritual cannibalism]]. The act of eating another human was deeply connected to the [[Aztec mythology]], in which gods needed to consume the sacrificed flesh and blood of humans to sustain themselves, and the world. One way to look at this is that since human flesh was a food of the gods, it was sacred, and consuming sacred food could sanctify an individual and bring him or her closer to the gods. Further, certain warriors, in their afterlife, were believed to have been turned into butterflies and hummingbirds with the ability to fly back to the realm of the living to feed on nectar. From this, the importance the Aztecs ascribed to the act of eating is clear.<ref>Carrasco, 447-450</ref>\n\n==Meals==\nMost sources describe two meals per day, though there is an account of labourers getting three meals, one at dawn, another one at around 9 in the morning and one at around 3 in the afternoon.<ref>Coe,  111</ref> This is similar to the custom in contemporary Europe, but it is unclear if intake of ''[[Atole|\u0101t\u014dlli]]'', maize [[gruel]], was considered a meal or not. Drinking a good amount of the thicker kinds of ''\u0101t\u014dlli'' could equal the calories in several corn tortillas, and ''\u0101t\u014dlli'' was consumed on a daily basis by most of the population.\n\n===Feasts===\n[[Image:Aztec feast 5.jpg|300px|thumb|Aztec men at a feast. [[Florentine Codex]].]]\nMany accounts exist of Aztec feasts and banquets and the ceremony that surrounded them. Before a meal, servants presented fragrant tobacco tubes and sometimes also flowers with which the guests could rub their head, hands and neck. Before the meal would start each guest would drop a little food on the ground as an offering to the god [[Tlaltecuhtli]]. As military prowess was highly praised among the Aztecs, table manners imitated the movement of warriors. The smoking tubes and flowers went from the left hand of the servant to the right hand of the guest and the plate accompanying the smoking tube went from the right hand to the left hand.\n\nThis was an imitation of how a warrior received his ''[[atlatl]]'' darts and shield. The flowers passed out bore different names depending on how they were handed out; \"sword flowers\" went from left hand to right and \"shield flowers\" went from right hand to left. When eating, guests would hold their individual bowls filled with dipping sauce in the centre of the right hand and then dip corn tortillas or tamales (which were served from baskets) with the left. The meal was concluded by serving chocolate, often served in a [[calabash]] cup along with a stirring stick.<ref>Coe, 100-103</ref>\n\nMen and women were separated at banquets and, though it is not entirely clear from the sources, it seems as if only men drank chocolate.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The women would more likely have drunk ''pozolli'' (maize gruel from finely ground maize) or some type of pulque. Rich hosts could often receive guests sitting in rooms around an open courtyard similar to Middle Eastern [[caravanserai]] (or ''han'' in Turkish) and senior military men would perform dances. Festivities would begin at midnight and some would drink chocolate and eat hallucinogenic mushrooms so that they could tell about their experiences and visions to the other guests.\n\nRight before dawn singing commenced and offerings were burned and buried in the courtyard to ensure the fortune of the children of the hosts. At dawn, the remaining flowers, smoking tubes and food were given to the old and poor that had been invited, or to the servants.  As with all other aspects of life, the Aztecs stressed the dual nature of all things, and toward the end of the banquet the host would be sternly reminded by his elders of his own mortality and that he should not be overcome with pride.<ref>Coe, 74-81</ref>\n\n==== Domestic feasts ====\nAztec private feasts included music singing, storytelling, dancing, incense burning, flowers, tobacco, offerings, and gift-giving. Aztec feasts were a display of material culture and wealth, notes by Friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and Friar Diego Dur\u00e1n describe Aztec feasts as events where \"everything was to be created in abundance\". Feasts were organized to the point of ritual, there were roles and relationships displayed and reinforced. Hosts needed to meet the obligations of banqueting, in order not to \"offend\" their guests, and guests needed to reinforce the hosts' stature. There are multiple important events in Aztec society that called for feasts. Child naming ceremonies involved the ritual calling out of the baby's name and progressed into a large organized feast. This feast could consist of dressed bird or dog, meat and/or maize tamales, beans, cacao bean, and roasted chilli's.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIzcalli child presentation ceremonies were also important, part of the Aztec agricultural calendar. Izcalli was the last \"month\" of the calendar. Every fourth Izcalli celebration included the introduction of children, born during this four year period, to the Aztec community. This feast introduced the child to actions important to their religious life such as singing, dancing, ceremonial drinking, sacrificial bloodletting, and body modification. The food served during this feast was traditionally spicy. Noted by Sahagun was: \"And the sauce of the tamales was called 'red chilli sauce'. And when the good common folk ate, they sat about sweating, they sat about burning themselves. And the tamales stuffed with greens were indeed hot, gleaming hot.\" The wedding process also contained many ceremonies, the parents of a young male, when marriage was desired, had to ask permission of his ''calmecac'' school leaders. Part of this process was a feast of tamales, chocolate, and sauces. During the wedding itself, there were feasts of pulque, tamales, and turkey meat. Funerary feasts were also common among the wealthy class. Served at these feasts was octli (pulque), chocolate, bird, fruit, seeds, and other foods.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Public feasts ====\nParts of the 260-day ritual calendar of the Aztecs were ''[[veintena]]''. ''Veintena'' can be approximated as \"months\"; however, they are more aptly described as 20-day public ceremony periods. Each 20-day ''veintena'' was a full and complex festival made up of ceremonies dedicated to specific gods and deities of the current ''veintena''. Regional and local ceremonies differed in deities and methods from the official state-sponsored ones at Tenochtitlan. Food was an important part of ''veintena'' ceremonies; it was both consumed and adorned by priests. It was noted that during the ceremonies honoring ''Xipe Totec'' the priests would adorn themselves in arrays of \"butterfly nets, fish banners, ear of maize, coyote heads made of amaranth seed, tortillas, thick rolls covered with a dough of amaranth seeds, toasted maize, red amaranth, and maize stalks with ears of green or tender maize.\" In the ceremonies honouring ''[[Mixcoatl]]'', after a \"great hunt,\" Aztecs would feast on deer, rabbit, and all other animals killed in the hunt. Hunting was also important to celebrations dedicated to ''Xiuhtecuhtli'' when Aztec boys and young men would hunt for ten days. The products of these hunts would then be turned over to priests, who cooked them in large fire flies.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Food preparation==\nThe main method of preparation was boiling or steaming in two-handled clay pots or jars called ''xoctli'' in Nahuatl and translated into Spanish as ''olla'' (\"pot\"). Ceramics were vital to the cooking process and served at least three major purposes: [[Nixtamalization|nixtamal]] preparation, tamale steaming, and cooking beans, stews, and hot beverages.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 101</ref> The xoctli was filled with food and heated over a fire. It could also be used to steam food by pouring a little water into the xoctli and then placing tamales wrapped in maize husks on a light structure of twigs in the middle of the pot.<ref>Coe, 109</ref>\n\nTortillas, tamales, casseroles and the sauces that went with them were the most common dishes. Chili and salt were both ubiquitous and the most basic meal was usually just corn tortillas that were dipped in chilis that had been ground in a mortar with a little water. Dough could be used to encase meat, sometimes even whole turkeys, before cooking. In major Aztec towns and cities there were vendors that sold street food of all kinds, catering to both the rich and poor. Other than ingredients and prepared food every imaginable type of ''\u0101t\u014dlli'' could be bought, either to quench one's thirst or as an instant meal in liquid form.<ref>Coe, 149; 117-19</ref>\n\nWomen, in charge of domestic duties in Aztec societies, were also the cooks.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, p. 99</ref> Generally, men did not directly participate in cooking. Based on where cooking tools are usually found, it seems that kitchens were a simple, single-room structure separate from the house itself. Most cooking probably took place on a small triangular hearth in the kitchen.<ref name=\":0\">Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 100</ref>\n\n=== Kitchen tools ===\nMost information regarding Aztec cooking tools comes from finding the tools themselves, as depictions of the tools in art are rare, and when they are featured, they aren't particularly prominent or detailed. Luckily, tools were most often made of stone and ceramics and as such can be found in large quantities in good condition for study.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Manos'' and ''[[metate]]s'' were the tools of choice for grinding nixtamalized maize (nixtamal). It was also used to grind sauce ingredients like peppers, though different sets of manos and metates would likely have been used to avoid getting other flavors in maize dough ([[masa]]). The metate is a stone slab that can be slightly concave. Nixtamal was placed on top of the metate and the mano, effectively a rough cylindrical stone, was rolled over it, grinding the nixtamal. The mano and metate is a tool that would have been used every day, since ground nixtamal usually goes bad within a day. Ethnographies of 20th century indigenous communities seem to indicate that women could have spent between four and eight hours a day at a metate grinding nixtamal, but women in a 2007 study at [[Xaltocan, Tlaxcala|Xaltocan]] insisted that an experienced woman could grind all she needed for the day in only an hour; regardless, use of a metate for grinding is considered tedious work.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 102</ref><ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 108-109</ref> The mano and metate remained as the grinding tool of choice in central Mexico, as it tends to grind finer than European-style mills, and tortillas made from masa ground on a mano and metate are still considered of a higher quality, if much more labor-intensive.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 111</ref> However, some argue that the reason women used to and still do grind nixtamal by hand is because it was a way for men to limit the amount of free time women have in an effort to prevent extramarital affairs.<ref>Bauer, Arnold J. 1990. Millers and Grinders: Technology and Household Economy in Mesoamerica. ''Agricultural History'' 64 (1):1\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[molcajete]]'' is another grinding tool. It is a bowl made of porous [[basalt]] rock, and an accompanying basalt cylinder was used to grind foods into the molcajete. It looks and functions very similarly to a western [[mortar and pestle]]. The fact that a molcajete will hold whatever is prepared in it means it would have been ideal for preparing sauces that would spill off the sides of a metate, and molcajetes could also be used as serving vessels.<ref name=\":1\">Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda, 104</ref>\n\n[[Comal (cookware)|Comals]]<nowiki/> are a type of ceramic griddle with a smooth top and a porous bottom used for cooking various types of tortillas, as well as for non-maize foods like peppers and roasted squash. It is possible that comales could also have been used as makeshift pot lids for the sake of convenience.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere are several references to frying in the accounts of Spanish chroniclers, but the only specification of the Aztec type of frying appears to be some kind of cooking that was done with syrup, not cooking fat. This is corroborated by the fact that no evidence for large-scale extraction of vegetable oils exist and that no cooking vessels suited for frying have been found by archaeologists.<ref>Coe, 36</ref>\n\n==Foods==\n[[Image:Aztec spirulina.jpg|thumb|300px|Spirulina could be harvested off the surface of lakes with nets or shovels and was then dried as cakes which could be eaten with corn tortilla or as a condiment.]]\n[[File:Corn tortilla tlaxcalli Codex Mendoza Aztec glyph symbol.png|thumb|300px|This drawing is a remake of the [[corn tortilla]] [[Aztec writing|glyph]] found in the [[Codex Mendoza]]<ref>Mursell, I.

[[Florentine Codex]], late 16th century.]]\n\n[[Maize]] was the single most important staple of the Aztecs. It was consumed at every meal by all social classes, and played a central role in Aztec mythology. To some of the first Europeans, the Aztecs described maize as \"precious, our flesh, our bones\".<ref>Coe, 89</ref> It came in a vast number of varieties of various sizes, shapes and colors; yellow, reddish, white with stripes of color, black, with or without speckles and a blue-husked variant that was considered to be particularly precious. Other local and regional varieties must have also existed but few were recorded. Maize was revered to such an extent that women blew on maize before putting it into the cooking pot so that it would not fear the fire, and any maize that was dropped on the ground was picked up rather than being wasted. One of the Aztec informants of the Spanish Franciscan missionary and chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] explained the practice in the following way:\n\n{{quote|Our sustenance suffers, it lies weeping. If we should not gather it up, it would accuse us before our Lord. It would say: O our Lord, this vassal picked me not up when I lay scattered on the ground. Punish him. Or perhaps we should starve.<ref>Quoted in Coe, 88</ref>}}\n\nA process called [[nixtamalization]] was used all over America where maize was the staple. The word is a compound of the [[Nahuatl]] words ''nextli'' (\"ashes\") and ''tamalli'' (\"unformed corn dough; [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]\"), and the process is still in use today. Dry maize grain is soaked and cooked in an [[alkaline]] solution, usually [[limewater]]. This releases the [[pericarp]], the outer hull of the grains and makes the maize easier to grind. The process transforms maize from a simple source of [[carbohydrate]]s into a considerably more complete nutritional package; it increases the amount of [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] that are added through the alkalide or the vessel used in the process and [[niacin]], [[riboflavin]] and more [[protein]] already present in the corn that is not digestible to humans are made available through the process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Cambridge World History of Food'', 108-110</ref>\n\nThe inhibited growth of certain [[mycotoxins]] (toxic fungi) is another benefit of nixtamalization. If the processed maize, the ''nextamalli'', is allowed to ferment, further nutrients, including [[amino acid]]s such as [[lysine]] and [[tryptophan]] are made available. Together with beans, vegetables, fruit, chilis and salt nixtamalized corn can form a healthy and diverse diet.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Spices===\nA great number of herbs and spices were available to the Aztecs in seasoning food. Among the most important, [[chili peppers]] come in a wide variety of species and cultivars, some domesticated and many of them wild. These included a great range of heat intensity depending on the amount of capsaicin present, with some being mild and others being very piquant. The chilis were often dried and ground for storage and use in cooking, some roasted beforehand to impart different tastes. Flavors varied significantly from one type to another, including sweet, fruity, earthy, smoky, and fiery hot.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bosland|first=Paul|year=1999|title=Chiles: A Gift from a Fiery God|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/|journal=HortScience|volume=34 |issue=5|pages=810|via=}}</ref>\n\nNative species of plants used as seasonings produced flavors similar to Old World spices that often proved to be more easily accessible in cooking after the Spanish conquest. [[Culantro]] or Mexican coriander provides a much stronger flavor than its Old World parallel, cilantro, and its leaves can be easier to dry. [[Mexican oregano]] and Mexican anise likewise produce flavors reminiscent of their Mediterranean counterparts, while [[allspice]] has an aroma somewhere in between nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.\n\nThe bark of [[canella]] or white cinnamon has a soft, delicate flavor that might have eased the acceptance of the more pungent cinnamon of Ceylon into modern Mexican cuisine. Before the arrival of onions and garlic, subtler but similar wild plants such as Kunth's onion and other southern-ranging species of the genus ''[[Allium]]'', as well as the fragrant leaves of [[garlic vine]] may have been appropriated. Other flavorings available included [[mesquite]], [[vanilla]], [[achiote]], [[epazote]], [[hoja santa]], [[Plagiobothrys|popcorn flower]], [[avocado]] leaf, and other indigenous plants.\n\n==Drink==\n[[Image:Aztec5figure9.jpg|300px|thumb|A painting from [[Codex Mendoza]] showing an elderly Aztec woman drinking pulque.]]\n\n=== Alcohol ===\nMany different alcoholic beverages were made from fermented maize, honey, pineapple, cactus fruit and other plants. The most common was ''octli'' which was made from [[Century plant|maguey]] sap. It is today known as [[pulque]], an [[Antilles|Antillean]] term. It was drunk by all social classes, though some nobles made a point of not downing such a humble beverage. Drinking was tolerated, even for children at some occasions, but becoming intoxicated was not. The penalties could be very stiff, and were stricter for the elite.<ref>Coe, 84-87</ref>\n\nThe first transgression of a commoner would be punished by tearing his house down and sending him off to live in the field like an animal. A noble would generally not get a second chance and could be executed for overindulging in alcohol. Getting intoxicated appeared to have been more tolerated for elderly people; Spanish translations of the Codex Mendoza note that there were specific circumstances that allowed the elderly to get intoxicated: \n\n<blockquote>It is shown how, according to the laws and customs of the lose of seventy years of age, man or woman, if such old persons had children or grandchildren. These had license and freedom to use it.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nThis did not prevent the occasional tragedy of nobles who became alcoholics and drank themselves into poverty, squalor and an early death. An informant of Sahag\u00fan told the sad story of a former [[tlacateccatl]], a general and commander of over 8,000 troops:\n\n{{quote|He drank up all his land; he sold it all ... Tlacateccatl, a valiant warrior, a great warrior, and a great nobleman, sometimes, somewhere on the road where there was travel, lay fallen, drunk, wallowing in ordure.<ref>Quoted in Coe, 85</ref>}}\n\n===''\u0100t\u014dle''===\n''\u0100t\u014dle'' ({{IPA-nah|a\u02d0\u02c8to\u02d0l\u02d0i|}}), maize gruel, accounted for a considerable amount of the daily calorie intake. The basic recipe for ''\u0101t\u014dle'' was eight parts water and six parts maize with lime that was cooked until it softened and then ground. The mixture was then boiled until it thickened. There were many variations of ''\u0101t\u014dle'': a mixture of 1/10 maguey syrup made ''nequ\u0101t\u014dle''; adding chili ground with salt and tomato would make ''iztac \u0101t\u014dle''; letting maize dough sour for 4\u20135 days and then adding more fresh dough with chili and salt would make ''xoco\u0101t\u014dle''. Beans, baked corn tortillas with the crust cut off, toasted maize, chia, amaranth and honey could also be added and there was ''pinolli'', ground toasted maize that was carried by travelers in sacks which could be mixed with water on the road for an instant meal.<ref>Coe, 117-118</ref>\n\n===Cacao===\nCacao had immense symbolic value. It was a rare luxury and an import that could not be grown within the boundaries of the [[Aztec Empire]]. There are no detailed descriptions of how cacao solids were prepared, but there are a number of allusions to the fact that it was eaten in some form. Cacao beans were among the most valuable commodities and could be used as a form of payment, although of somewhat low value; 80-100 beans could be used to buy a small mantle or a canoe-full of fresh water if one lived on the salty part of the lakes around Tenochtitlan. Nevertheless, beans were frequently counterfeited by filling empty cacao shells with dirt or mud.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|last=Civitello|first=Linda|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-41195-7|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=112|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nCacao was commonly drunk as ''cacahuatl'', \"cacao water\",<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sophie D.

It was considered a potent intoxicant and something that was drunk with great solemnity and gravity and was described as something \"not drunk unthinkingly\" by the Spanish chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan|Sahag\u00fan]]. Chocolate could be prepared in a huge variety of ways and most of them involved mixing hot or tepid water with toasted and ground cacao beans, maize and any number of flavorers such as chili, honey, vanilla and a wide variety of spices.<ref>The full list of cacao flavorers is very extensive, but some of the common ones were ''uei nacaztli'' (''[[Cymbopetalum penduliflorum]]''); ''teonacaztli'' (''[[Chiranthodendron pentadactylon]]''), which had the flavor of \"black pepper with a resinous bitterness\" and was commonly used at banquets; ''mecaxochitl'' (''[[Piper amalgo]]''), a relation of [[black pepper]]; ''yolloxochitl'' (the flower of ''[[Magnolia mexicana]]'') which had the taste of ripe [[melon]]; ''piztle'' (the seeds of ''[[Calocarpum mammosum]]''<!-- this is now either Manilkara zapota (C. mammosum Pierre) or Pouteria sapota (C. mammosum auct. non Pierre) -->), with the flavor of bitter [[almond]]s; ''pochotl'' (the seeds of Ceipa spp.), described as \"sweet and tasty\"; and [[allspice]]. One of the most common recipes consisted of ''mecaxochitl'', ''uei nacaztli'', vanilla, softened maize and cacao mixed with tepid water, and was drunk immediately after preparation.</ref>\n\nThe ingredients were mixed and beaten with a beating stick or aerated by pouring the chocolate from one vessel to another. If the cacao was of high quality, this produced a rich head of foam. The head could be set aside, the drink further aerated to produce another head, which was also set aside and then placed on top of the drink along with the rest of the foam before serving.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/truehistoryofcho0000coes|url-access=registration|title=The True History of Chocolate|last=Coe|first=Sophie Dobzhansky|last2=Coe|first2=Michael D.|date=2007|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=9780500286968|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/truehistoryofcho0000coes/page/86 86]\u201387|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Dietary norms==\nThe Aztecs stressed moderation in all aspects of life. European authors and chroniclers were often impressed by what they perceived as exemplary frugality, simplicity and moderation. [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]], the bishop of [[Puebla]] and viceroy of [[New Spain]] in the 1640s reported:\n\n{{quote|I have seen them eat with great deliberation, silence, and modesty, so that one knows that the patience shown in all of their habits is shown in eating as well, and they do not allow themselves to be rushed by hunger or the urge to satisfy it.<ref>Quoted in Coe, 83</ref>}}\n\n===Fasting===\nThe primary meaning of an Aztec fast was to abstain from salt and chilis and all members of Aztec society engaged in fasting to some extent. There were no regular exceptions from the fast, something that shocked the first Europeans who came into contact with the Aztecs. Though fasting was common in Europe, there were permanent exceptions for the women and small children, the sick or frail and the elderly. Before the New Fire ceremony, which occurred every 52 years, some priests fasted for a whole year; the other priests 80 days and lords 8 days.<ref name=\"Coe, 83-84\">Coe, 83-84</ref>\n\nCommoners engaged in fasts, but less rigorously. There was also a permanent contingent of fasters in [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuacan]]. Along with various ascetic rigors like sleeping on a stone pillow, they fasted for periods of four years on one 50-gram corn tortilla (about 2 ounces) per day. The only respite came every 20 days, when they were allowed to eat whatever they wanted.<ref name=\"Coe, 83-84\"/>\n\nEven rulers such as [[Moctezuma]]{{dn|date=November 2019}} were expected to cut down on their otherwise luxurious lifestyle and did so with considerable conviction and effort. At times he abstained from luxuries and sex with women and ate only cakes of ''michihuauhtli'' and seeds of [[amaranth]] or [[Chenopodium|goosefoot]]. The lord's chocolate was also replaced with water mixed from parched bean powder. This can be contrasted with the fasts of many European nobles and clergy that, while obeying the letter of the religious regulation by replacing meat and animal products with fish, were still luxurious feasts in their own right.<ref>Coe, 70</ref>\n\nDuring the fourteenth month, called [[Quecholli]], ceremonies in honor of the hunting god [[Mixcoatl]] there would be a large hunt as part of the ritual. To prepare for the hunt Aztecs would fast for five days. The fasting was done, according to Sahagun, \"for the deer, so that it would be a successful hunt.\"\n\nDuring the celebrations of the god [[Tezcatlipoca]], his priests fasted for ten, five, or seven days continuously before the main feasts. They were known as \"those who do penance.\"\n\nDuring celebrations of [[Hu\u012btzil\u014dp\u014dchtli|Huitzilopoctli]] it was noted by Friar Duran: \"I have been assured that they became so weak because of the terrible eight-day fast that for another eight days they were not themselves, nor were they satisfied with eating. Many became gravely ill, and the lives of many pregnant women were in danger.\"\n\nDuring festivals in honor of [[Chicomec\u014d\u0101tl|Chicomecoatl]], there would be a drastic back and forth of gorging and fasting. So much so that people would become ill.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sacred consumption: food and ritual in Aztec art and culture|last=Mor\u00e1n|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Food and politics ==\nBernal Diaz del Castillo comments on how the ruler of Tenochtitlan was served food:\n\n<blockquote>His cooks had more than thirty styles of dishes made according to their fashion and usage, and they put them on small low clay braziers so that they would not get cold ... if it was cold they made him a fire of glowing coals made from the bark of certain trees ... the odor of the bark ... was most fragrant ... they put the tablecloths of white fabric ... They served him on Cholula pottery, some red and some black ... and from time to time they brought him some cups of fine gold, with a certain drink made of cacao.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nSahagun provides a list of the different types of tlaquetzalli, a chocolate drink served to Aztec lords: \n\n<blockquote>The ruler was served his chocolate, with which he finished [his repast] - green, made of tender cacao; honeyed chocolate made with ground-up dried flowers - with green vanilla pods; bright red chocolate; orange-colored chocolate; rose-colored chocolate; black chocolate; white chocolate.\"<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nAztec expansion was targeted in ways to gain or maintain access to foodstuffs need for ceremony and everyday life. The leader's ability to acquire food needed for ritual was important for his political success.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Cannibalism==\n{{main|Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America}}\n\n[[File:Magliabchanopage 73r.jpg|300px|thumb|A scene depicting ritualistic cannibalism being practiced in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]], folio 73r.]]\nThe Aztecs practiced ritualistic [[cannibalism]]. Victims, usually prisoners of war, were sacrificed in public on top of temples and pyramids by cutting out their hearts. The bodies were then thrown down to the ground where they were dismembered. The pieces were then distributed to the elite, which were mostly warriors and priests. The meat was consumed in the form of stews flavored only with salt and eaten with corn tortillas, but without the otherwise ubiquitous chili.<ref name=\"Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86\">Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86</ref>\n\nThe veintena [[Xipe Totec#Annual festival|Tlacaxipehualiztli]] was one of intense human sacrifice, it was noted by Sahagun that \"it was the time when all captives died, all those taken, all those who were made captive, the men, the women, all the children.\" It began with the sacrifice of captured warriors, the flesh of the sacrificed warriors would be taken to the residence of the Aztec who had captured the warrior. The capturer was forbidden to feast on the flesh of the sacrificed, however his family would eat it. A stew called [[Pozole|tlacatlaolli]] was prepared out of dried maize and into each serving would be placed a piece of the flesh of the captive.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s the anthropologist [[Michael Harner]] suggested that the Aztecs had resorted to large-scale, organized cannibalism to make up for a supposed [[protein]] deficiency in the diet. This idea gained limited support from some scholars, but has been shown to be based on unfounded assumptions about eating habits, agriculture and demographics, making it a highly unlikely scenario.<ref name=\"Ortiz de Montellano, 85-86\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Mesoamerica|Food|History}}\n* [[Mexican cuisine]]\n* [[Maya cuisine]]\n* [[Moctezuma's Table]]\n* [[Muisca cuisine]]\n* [[Inca cuisine]]\n* [[Domesticated plants of Mesoamerica]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Bosland, Paul.

Afterwards the tribes started fighting each other and decided to invite the Varangians, led by Rurik, to reestablish order.

Since the 19th century, there have been attempts to identify him with the Rurik of Russian chronicles.\n\nRorik of Dorestad was a member of one of two competing families reported by the [[Frankish Empire|Frank]]ish chroniclers as having ruled the nascent Danish kingdom at [[Hedeby]], and was likely nephew of king [[Harald Klak]].  He is mentioned as receiving lands in [[Friesland]] from [[Louis the Pious|Emperor Louis I]]. This was not enough for him, and he started to plunder neighbouring lands: he took [[Dorestad]] in 850, attacked Hedeby in 857, and looted [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in 859, yet his own lands were ravaged in his absence. The Emperor was enraged and stripped him of all his possessions in 860. After that, Rorik disappears from the Western sources for a considerable period of time, while only two years later, in 862, the Russian chronicle's Rurik arrives in the eastern Baltic, builds the fortress of Ladoga, and later moves to Novgorod.\n\nRorik of Dorestad reappeared in Frankish chronicles in 870, when his Friesland [[demesne]] was returned to him by [[Charles the Bald]]; in 882 Rorik of Dorestad is mentioned as dead (without a date of death specified). The Russian chronicle places the death of Rurik of Novgorod at 879, three years earlier than the Frankish chronicles. According to Western sources, the ruler of Friesland was converted to Christianity by the Franks. This may have parallels with the [[Christianization of the Rus' Khaganate|Christianization of the Rus']], as reported by [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] in 867.\n\nThe idea of identifying the Rurik of Nestor's chronicle with Rorik of Dorestad of the Carolingian chronicles was revived by the anti-Normanists [[Boris Rybakov]] and Anatoly H.

The temple was built in 1070 at the time of Emperor [[L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]]. It is one of several temples in Vietnam which is dedicated to [[Confucius]], sages and scholars. The temple is located to the south of the [[Imperial Citadel of Th\u0103ng Long]]. The various pavilions, halls, statues and stelae of doctors are places where offering ceremonies, study sessions and the strict exams of the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] took place.

For nearly two centuries, despite wars and disasters, the temple has preserved ancient architectural styles of many dynasties as well as precious relics. Major restorations have taken place in 1920, 1954 and 2000.<ref>http://goseasia.about.com/od/vietnamstopattractions/a/temple_of_literature_hanoi.htm</ref> \n:\"In the autumn of the year Canh Tuat, the second year of Than Vu (1070), in the 8th lunar month, during the reign of King [[L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]], the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu was built. The statues of [[Confucius]], his four best [[Disciples of Confucius|disciples]]: [[Yan Hui]] ({{lang|vi|Nhan Uy\u00ean}}), [[Zengzi]] ({{lang|vi|T\u0103ng S\u00e2m}}), [[Zisi]] ({{lang|vi|T\u1eed T\u01b0}}), and [[Mencius]] ({{lang|vi|M\u1ea1nh T\u1eed}}), as well as the [[Duke of Zhou]] ({{lang|vi|Chu C\u00f4ng}}), were carved and 72 other statues of Confucian scholars were painted. Ceremonies were dedicated to them in each of the four seasons. The Crown Princes studied here.\"<ref>\"Complete History of the Great Viet\"</ref>\n\nIn 1076, [[Vietnam]]'s first university, the \"Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m\" or [[Guozijian|Imperial Academy]], was established within the temple during the reign of [[L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] to educate Vietnam's [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]], nobles, royalty, and other members of the elite. The university remained open from 1076 to 1779. In 1802, the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]]'s monarchs founded the [[Hu\u1ebf]] capital where they established a new imperial academy. The academy at the [[Hanoi]] temple lost its prominence and became a school of the [[Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c District]].\n\nUnder the [[French Indochina|French protectorate]], the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu - Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m was registered as a ''[[Monument historique]]'' in 1906. During the period of 1945\u20131954, the French demolished parts of the temple to make room for the sick and wounded since the hospitals were full during times of war. Campaigns of restoration were pursued in 1920 and 1947 under the responsibility of [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] (French School of the Far East).<ref>Tr\u00e2n-h\u00e0m-T\u00e2n (1951),  [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/befeo_0336-1519_1951_num_45_1_5513 Studies about the Temple of Literature (Hanoi)], EFEO, vol. 45, n\u00b0 45-1, pp. 89-118 (in French)</ref>\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Temple of Literature - main gate.jpg|thumb|left|The main gate to the temple]]The temple layout is similar to that of the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] at [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]], Confucius' birthplace. It covers an area of over 54000 square metres, including the V\u0103n lake, Gi\u00e1m park and the interior courtyards which are surrounded by a brick wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/art-entertainment/166406/master-plan-built-for-van-mieu---quoc-tu-giam.html|title=Master plan built for Van Mieu \u2013 Quoc Tu Giam|publisher=Vietnamnet|year=2016|accessdate=2017-12-09|language=en}}</ref> In front of the Great Gate are four tall pillars. On either side of the pillars are two stelae commanding horsemen to dismount.\nThe gate opens onto three pathways which continues through the complex. The centre path was reserved for the monarch and above the center path there is a big bronze bell, The path to the left is for the administrative Mandarins and the path to the right is for military Mandarins.  The interior of the site is divided into five courtyards. The first two courtyards are quiet areas with ancient trees and trimmed lawns, where scholars would relax away from the bustle of the outside world.\n\nThe bell located above the main gate was used to signify that an important person was coming through and was added to the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in the 19th century. The bell was made out of Bronze and could only be touched by monks. On the bell several patterns can be found including an outline of a phoenix, which represents beauty, and a dragon, which represents power. Both of these symbols are used to represent the Emperor and Queen. A bell can be found in all of the pagodas in Vietnam.\n\n===First Courtyard===\nThe first courtyard extends from the Great Portico to the Dai Trung (\u0110\u1ea1i Trung), which is flanked by two smaller gates: the Dai Tai gate (\u0110\u1ea1i T\u00e0i M\u00f4n) and the Thanh Duc gate (Th\u00e0nh \u0110\u1ee9c M\u00f4n).\n\n===Second Courtyard===\n[[File:Hanoi Temple of Literature.jpg|thumb|Second Courtyard and Khue Van pavilion]]\nThe second courtyard is known as the great central courtyard or sometimes the courtyard of great success. It features the Khue Van pavilion (Khu\u00ea V\u0103n C\u00e1c, {{linktext|\u594e|\u6587|\u95a3}}), a unique architectural work built in 1805 and a symbol of present-day Hanoi. The Khue Van pavilion is built on four white-washed stone stilts. At the top is a red-coloured with two circular windows and an elaborate roof. Inside, a bronze bell hangs from the ceiling to be rung on auspicious occasions. Many beautiful poetic phrases preserved on the pavilion glorify Vietnamese traditional culture. Beside the Khue Van pavilion are the Suc Van gate (S\u00fac V\u0103n M\u00f4n) and the Bi Van gate (Bi V\u0103n M\u00f4n). These two gates are dedicated to the beauty of literature, both its content and its form. In the first and second courtyards there are [[topiaries]] (bushes that are cut into particular shapes) that represent the 12 zodiac animals.\n\n===Third Courtyard===\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi 5.jpg|thumb|Third Courtyard of the temple with the Thien Quang well and the red Khue Van pavilion]] One enters the third courtyard from the Khue Van pavilion. In the third courtyard is the Thien Quang well (Thi\u00ean Quang T\u1ec9nh). On either side of the well stand two great halls which house the treasures of the temple.\n\n===Stelae of Doctors===\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi 4.jpg|right|thumb|[[bixi (tortoise)|Turtle Steles]] with the names of those successful at the royal exams]] The construction of the stone stelae began in 1484 under the Emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]]. He erected 116 steles of carved blue stone turtles with elaborate motifs to honour talent and encourage study. The Turtle (Quy, \u9f9c) is one of the nation's four holy creatures - the others are the Dragon (Long, \u9f8d), the Unicorn (Ly, \u9e9f) and the Phoenix (Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng, \u9cf3). The turtle is a symbol of longevity and wisdom. The shape and size of the turtle changed with the passage of time.\nThe doctors' steles are a valuable historical resource for the study of culture, education and sculpture in Vietnam. 82 stelae remain. They depict the names and birth places of 1307 graduates of 82 triennial royal exams. Between 1442 and 1779, eighty-one exams were held by the [[L\u00ea dynasty]] and one was held by the [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]].<ref>Van Mieu Quoc Tu Giam, The Gioi Publishers, Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 1994</ref> The ancient Chinese engravings on each stele praise the merits of the monarch and cite the reason for holding royal exams. They also record the mandarins who were tasked with organising the exams. It used to be common to rub the stone turtles' heads, but now there is a fence that is meant to prevent people from doing this in order to preserve the turtles.\n\nThey are a valuable historical resource for the study of philosophy history, culture, education, society and sculpture in Vietnam. The stalae were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] in 2011. \n\n===Fourth Courtyard===\nOne enters the fourth courtyard through the Dai Thanh gate (''\u0110\u1ea1i Th\u00e0nh M\u00f4n''). On either side are two smaller gates: Kim Thanh gate (''Kim Thanh M\u00f4n'') and the Ngoc Chan gate (''Ng\u1ecdc Ch\u1ea5n M\u00f4n''). This courtyard is the ceremonial heart of the complex. \n[[File:Main hall, V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu, Hanoi, Vietnam (2006).jpg|thumb|right|Altars to Confucius and his disciples]]\nOn each side of the ceremonial fourth courtyard stand two halls. Their original purpose was to house altars to the seventy-two most honoured disciples of [[Confucius]] and [[Chu V\u0103n An]] (a rector of the Imperial Academy). In the centre of the fourth courtyard is the House of Ceremonies (''\u0110\u1ea1i B\u00e1i \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng''). The next building is the ''Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0110i\u1ec7n'', where Confucius and his four closest disciples Yanhui, Zengshen, Zisi and Mencius are worshipped. The sanctuary also hosts altars to ten honoured philosophers. These pavilions reflect the style of the early 19th century.  A small museum displays ink wells, pens, books and personal artefacts belonging to some of the students that studied at the temple.\n\n===Fifth Courtyard===\nIn 1076, Emperor Ly Nhan Tong ordered the construction of an imperial academy as a fifth courtyard. Literate mandarins were selected as students. In 1236, the academy was enlarged and named ''Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Vi\u1ec7n'' and later ''Qu\u1ed1c H\u1ecdc Vi\u1ec7n''. In the L\u00ea dynasty it was called Th\u00e1i H\u1ecdc Vi\u1ec7n and was developed further. This development included the Minh Lu\u00e2n house, west and east classrooms, a storehouse for wooden printing blocks and two sets of three 25 room dormitories. The Kh\u1ea3i Th\u00e1nh shrine was built to honour the parents of Confucius. In 1946, the courtyard was destroyed by the French.{{citation needed|date= May 2012}}\nIn the year 2000, the fifth courtyard was reconstructed on grounds of the original \"Imperial Academy\". It honours the talents, the national traditions and the culture and education of Vietnam.\nThe design of the new fifth courtyard were based on the traditional architecture in harmony with the surrounding sights of the temple.  Several buildings were constructed including the front building, the rear building, the left and right buildings, a bell house and a drum house. The Th\u00e1i H\u1ecdc courtyard occupies 1530 sq.m. of the temple's total area of 6150 sq.m<ref>In Standard of</ref>.\nThe front building has a number of functions. Ceremonies in memory of cultural scholars are organised from the front building as are scientific activities and cultural events. \nThe rear building has two levels. The ground floor has a statue of Chu V\u0103n An (a rector of the academy) and shows exhibits of the temple and the academy with a display on Confucian education in Vietnam. \n[[File:Institut des Fils de lEtat (Temple de la litt\u00e9rature, Hanoi) (4356119550).jpg|thumb|Altar to [[Chu V\u0103n An]], rector of the imperial academy]]\nThe upper floor is dedicated to the three monarchs who contributed most to the foundation of the temple and the academy: L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1023\u20131072), who founded the temple in 1070, L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (1066\u20131127), who founded the Imperial Academy, and L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1442\u20131497), who ordered the erection of the turtle stone stelae of doctor laureates in 1484.\nOn either side of the rear building are square buildings which hold a drum and a bronze bell. The drum is 2.01 metres wide, 2.65 metres high,  has a volume of 10 m<sup>3</sup> and weighs 700 kilogram. The bell was cast in 2000. It has a height of 2.1 metres and it is 0.99 metres wide.\n\n== Study at the Imperial Academy ==\nThe organization of instruction and learning at the Imperial Academy began in 1076 under the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] and was further developed in the 15th century under the Le dynasty. The academy was headed by a rector (''T\u1ebf t\u1eedu'') and a vice-rector (''T\u01b0 nghi\u1ec7p''). The professors of the academy held different titles: ''Gi\u00e1o th\u1ee5'', ''Tr\u1ef1c gi\u1ea3ng'', ''Tr\u1ee3 gi\u00e1o'' and ''B\u00e1c s\u0129''.\n\nMany students lived and studied at the Temple. Most students (''Gi\u00e1m sinh'') had passed the regional exam (H\u01b0\u01a1ng Examination - ''Thi H\u01b0\u01a1ng'') before enrolling at the academy. During the course of study at the academy, the students focused on discussion of literature and wrote poetry as well. The students learned Chinese, Chinese philosophy, and Chinese history. They had textbooks printed on paper which were in both Chinese and Vietnamese. They read ''[[Four Books and Five Classics|The Four Books]]'' (''T\u1ee9 th\u01b0'', \u56db\u66f8): \"The Great Study\" (\u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ecdc, \u5927\u5b78), \"The Golden Means\" (Trung Dung, \u4e2d\u5eb8), \"The Analects\" (Lu\u1eadn Ng\u1eef, \u8ad6\u8a9e) and \"Mencius\" (M\u1ea1nh T\u1eed, \u5b5f\u5b50); ''[[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Pre-Confucian Classics]]'' (''Ng\u0169 Kinh'', \u4e94\u7d93): \"Book of Odes (Kinh Thi, \u8a69\u7d93), \"Book of Annals\" (Kinh Th\u01b0, \u66f8\u7d93), \"Book of Rites\" (Kinh L\u1ec5, \u79ae\u8a18), \"Book of Change\" (Kinh D\u1ecbch, \u6613\u7d93) and \"Book of Spring and Autumn\" (Kinh Xu\u00e2n Thu, \u6625\u79cb); ancient poetry and Chinese history among others.\n\nThe students enrolled for three to seven years. They had minor tests each month and four major tests per year. Success in the exams, certified by the Ministry of Rites (B\u1ed9 L\u1ec5, \u79ae\u90e8) qualified them to sit the national exam (H\u1ed9i Examination - ''Thi H\u1ed9i''). Success at the H\u1ed9i Examination qualified the student to sit the royal exam, the \u0110\u00ecnh Examination (''Thi \u0110\u00ecnh''), held at court. At this exam, the monarch himself posed the questions, responded to the candidate's answer and then ranked those who passed into different grades. The Imperial Academy was the largest centre in the country.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Fine arts===\n* Frederick Harris' painting, ''The Red Door'', is a watercolor of the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu - Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m, Hanoi<ref>{{cite web| website=Wired For Books| url=http://www.wiredforbooks.org/| title=Home page illustration| accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref> There are sometimes water puppet performances that tell about the history of Vietnam.

The various pavilions, halls, statues and stelae of doctors are places where offering ceremonies, study sessions and the strict exams of the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] took place. The temple is featured on the back of the 100,000 [[Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] banknote. Just before the Vietnamese New Year celebration [[T\u1ebft]], [[calligraphy|calligraphists]] will assemble outside the temple and write wishes in [[H\u00e1n]] characters. The art works are given away as gifts or are used as home decorations for special occasions.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi 3504185612 088052eb96 t.jpg|thumb|left|Thien Quang well]]<br>The temple was built in 1070 and was reconstructed during the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] (1225\u20131400) and in the subsequent dynasties. For nearly two centuries, despite wars and disasters, the temple has preserved ancient architectural styles of many dynasties as well as precious relics. Major restorations have taken place in 1920, 1954 and 2000.<ref>http://goseasia.about.com/od/vietnamstopattractions/a/temple_of_literature_hanoi.htm</ref> \n:\"In the autumn of the year Canh Tuat, the second year of Than Vu (1070), in the 8th lunar month, during the reign of King [[L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]], the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu was built. The statues of [[Confucius]], his four best [[Disciples of Confucius|disciples]]: [[Yan Hui]] ({{lang|vi|Nhan Uy\u00ean}}), [[Zengzi]] ({{lang|vi|T\u0103ng S\u00e2m}}), [[Zisi]] ({{lang|vi|T\u1eed T\u01b0}}), and [[Mencius]] ({{lang|vi|M\u1ea1nh T\u1eed}}), as well as the [[Duke of Zhou]] ({{lang|vi|Chu C\u00f4ng}}), were carved and 72 other statues of Confucian scholars were painted. Ceremonies were dedicated to them in each of the four seasons. The Crown Princes studied here.\"<ref>\"Complete History of the Great Viet\"</ref>\n\nIn 1076, [[Vietnam]]'s first university, the \"Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m\" or [[Guozijian|Imperial Academy]], was established within the temple during the reign of [[L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] to educate Vietnam's [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]], nobles, royalty, and other members of the elite. The university remained open from 1076 to 1779. In 1802, the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]]'s monarchs founded the [[Hu\u1ebf]] capital where they established a new imperial academy. The academy at the [[Hanoi]] temple lost its prominence and became a school of the [[Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c District]].\n\nUnder the [[French Indochina|French protectorate]], the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu - Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m was registered as a ''[[Monument historique]]'' in 1906. During the period of 1945\u20131954, the French demolished parts of the temple to make room for the sick and wounded since the hospitals were full during times of war. Campaigns of restoration were pursued in 1920 and 1947 under the responsibility of [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] (French School of the Far East).<ref>Tr\u00e2n-h\u00e0m-T\u00e2n (1951),  [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/befeo_0336-1519_1951_num_45_1_5513 Studies about the Temple of Literature (Hanoi)], EFEO, vol. 45, n\u00b0 45-1, pp. 89-118 (in French)</ref>\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Temple of Literature - main gate.jpg|thumb|left|The main gate to the temple]]The temple layout is similar to that of the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] at [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]], Confucius' birthplace. It covers an area of over 54000 square metres, including the V\u0103n lake, Gi\u00e1m park and the interior courtyards which are surrounded by a brick wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/art-entertainment/166406/master-plan-built-for-van-mieu---quoc-tu-giam.html|title=Master plan built for Van Mieu \u2013 Quoc Tu Giam|publisher=Vietnamnet|year=2016|accessdate=2017-12-09|language=en}}</ref> In front of the Great Gate are four tall pillars. On either side of the pillars are two stelae commanding horsemen to dismount.\nThe gate opens onto three pathways which continues through the complex. The centre path was reserved for the monarch and above the center path there is a big bronze bell, The path to the left is for the administrative Mandarins and the path to the right is for military Mandarins.  The interior of the site is divided into five courtyards. The first two courtyards are quiet areas with ancient trees and trimmed lawns, where scholars would relax away from the bustle of the outside world.\n\nThe bell located above the main gate was used to signify that an important person was coming through and was added to the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in the 19th century. The bell was made out of Bronze and could only be touched by monks. On the bell several patterns can be found including an outline of a phoenix, which represents beauty, and a dragon, which represents power. Both of these symbols are used to represent the Emperor and Queen. A bell can be found in all of the pagodas in Vietnam.\n\n===First Courtyard===\nThe first courtyard extends from the Great Portico to the Dai Trung (\u0110\u1ea1i Trung), which is flanked by two smaller gates: the Dai Tai gate (\u0110\u1ea1i T\u00e0i M\u00f4n) and the Thanh Duc gate (Th\u00e0nh \u0110\u1ee9c M\u00f4n).\n\n===Second Courtyard===\n[[File:Hanoi Temple of Literature.jpg|thumb|Second Courtyard and Khue Van pavilion]]\nThe second courtyard is known as the great central courtyard or sometimes the courtyard of great success. It features the Khue Van pavilion (Khu\u00ea V\u0103n C\u00e1c, {{linktext|\u594e|\u6587|\u95a3}}), a unique architectural work built in 1805 and a symbol of present-day Hanoi. The Khue Van pavilion is built on four white-washed stone stilts. At the top is a red-coloured with two circular windows and an elaborate roof. Inside, a bronze bell hangs from the ceiling to be rung on auspicious occasions. Many beautiful poetic phrases preserved on the pavilion glorify Vietnamese traditional culture. Beside the Khue Van pavilion are the Suc Van gate (S\u00fac V\u0103n M\u00f4n) and the Bi Van gate (Bi V\u0103n M\u00f4n). These two gates are dedicated to the beauty of literature, both its content and its form. In the first and second courtyards there are [[topiaries]] (bushes that are cut into particular shapes) that represent the 12 zodiac animals.\n\n===Third Courtyard===\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi 5.jpg|thumb|Third Courtyard of the temple with the Thien Quang well and the red Khue Van pavilion]] One enters the third courtyard from the Khue Van pavilion. In the third courtyard is the Thien Quang well (Thi\u00ean Quang T\u1ec9nh). On either side of the well stand two great halls which house the treasures of the temple.\n\n===Stelae of Doctors===\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi 4.jpg|right|thumb|[[bixi (tortoise)|Turtle Steles]] with the names of those successful at the royal exams]] The construction of the stone stelae began in 1484 under the Emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]]. He erected 116 steles of carved blue stone turtles with elaborate motifs to honour talent and encourage study. The Turtle (Quy, \u9f9c) is one of the nation's four holy creatures - the others are the Dragon (Long, \u9f8d), the Unicorn (Ly, \u9e9f) and the Phoenix (Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng, \u9cf3). The turtle is a symbol of longevity and wisdom. The shape and size of the turtle changed with the passage of time.\nThe doctors' steles are a valuable historical resource for the study of culture, education and sculpture in Vietnam. 82 stelae remain. They depict the names and birth places of 1307 graduates of 82 triennial royal exams. Between 1442 and 1779, eighty-one exams were held by the [[L\u00ea dynasty]] and one was held by the [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]].<ref>Van Mieu Quoc Tu Giam, The Gioi Publishers, Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 1994</ref> The ancient Chinese engravings on each stele praise the merits of the monarch and cite the reason for holding royal exams. They also record the mandarins who were tasked with organising the exams. It used to be common to rub the stone turtles' heads, but now there is a fence that is meant to prevent people from doing this in order to preserve the turtles.\n\nThey are a valuable historical resource for the study of philosophy history, culture, education, society and sculpture in Vietnam. The stalae were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] in 2011. \n\n===Fourth Courtyard===\nOne enters the fourth courtyard through the Dai Thanh gate (''\u0110\u1ea1i Th\u00e0nh M\u00f4n''). On either side are two smaller gates: Kim Thanh gate (''Kim Thanh M\u00f4n'') and the Ngoc Chan gate (''Ng\u1ecdc Ch\u1ea5n M\u00f4n''). This courtyard is the ceremonial heart of the complex. \n[[File:Main hall, V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu, Hanoi, Vietnam (2006).jpg|thumb|right|Altars to Confucius and his disciples]]\nOn each side of the ceremonial fourth courtyard stand two halls. Their original purpose was to house altars to the seventy-two most honoured disciples of [[Confucius]] and [[Chu V\u0103n An]] (a rector of the Imperial Academy). In the centre of the fourth courtyard is the House of Ceremonies (''\u0110\u1ea1i B\u00e1i \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng''). The next building is the ''Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0110i\u1ec7n'', where Confucius and his four closest disciples Yanhui, Zengshen, Zisi and Mencius are worshipped. The sanctuary also hosts altars to ten honoured philosophers. These pavilions reflect the style of the early 19th century.  A small museum displays ink wells, pens, books and personal artefacts belonging to some of the students that studied at the temple.\n\n===Fifth Courtyard===\nIn 1076, Emperor Ly Nhan Tong ordered the construction of an imperial academy as a fifth courtyard. Literate mandarins were selected as students. In 1236, the academy was enlarged and named ''Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Vi\u1ec7n'' and later ''Qu\u1ed1c H\u1ecdc Vi\u1ec7n''. In the L\u00ea dynasty it was called Th\u00e1i H\u1ecdc Vi\u1ec7n and was developed further. This development included the Minh Lu\u00e2n house, west and east classrooms, a storehouse for wooden printing blocks and two sets of three 25 room dormitories. The Kh\u1ea3i Th\u00e1nh shrine was built to honour the parents of Confucius. In 1946, the courtyard was destroyed by the French in 1946.{{citation needed|date= May 2012}}\nIn the year 2000, the fifth courtyard was reconstructed on grounds of the original \"Imperial Academy\". It honours the talents, the national traditions and the culture and education of Vietnam.\nThe design of the new fifth courtyard were based on the traditional architecture in harmony with the surrounding sights of the temple.  Several buildings were constructed including the front building, the rear building, the left and right buildings, a bell house and a drum house. The Th\u00e1i H\u1ecdc courtyard occupies 1530 sq.m. of the temple's total area of 6150 sq.m<ref>In Standard of</ref>.\nThe front building has a number of functions. Ceremonies in memory of cultural scholars are organised from the front building as are scientific activities and cultural events. \nThe rear building has two levels. The ground floor has a statue of Chu V\u0103n An (a rector of the academy) and shows exhibits of the temple and the academy with a display on Confucian education in Vietnam. \n[[File:Institut des Fils de lEtat (Temple de la litt\u00e9rature, Hanoi) (4356119550).jpg|thumb|Altar to [[Chu V\u0103n An]], rector of the imperial academy]]\nThe upper floor is dedicated to the three monarchs who contributed most to the foundation of the temple and the academy: L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1023\u20131072), who founded the temple in 1070, L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (1066\u20131127), who founded the Imperial Academy, and L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1442\u20131497), who ordered the erection of the turtle stone stelae of doctor laureates in 1484.\nOn either side of the rear building are square buildings which hold a drum and a bronze bell. The drum is 2.01 metres wide, 2.65 metres high,  has a volume of 10 m<sup>3</sup> and weighs 700 kilogram. The bell was cast in 2000. It has a height of 2.1 metres and it is 0.99 metres wide.\n\n== Study at the Imperial Academy ==\nThe organization of instruction and learning at the Imperial Academy began in 1076 under the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] and was further developed in the 15th century under the Le dynasty. The academy was headed by a rector (''T\u1ebf t\u1eedu'') and a vice-rector (''T\u01b0 nghi\u1ec7p''). The professors of the academy held different titles: ''Gi\u00e1o th\u1ee5'', ''Tr\u1ef1c gi\u1ea3ng'', ''Tr\u1ee3 gi\u00e1o'' and ''B\u00e1c s\u0129''.\n\nMany students lived and studied at the Temple. Most students (''Gi\u00e1m sinh'') had passed the regional exam (H\u01b0\u01a1ng Examination - ''Thi H\u01b0\u01a1ng'') before enrolling at the academy. During the course of study at the academy, the students focused on discussion of literature and wrote poetry as well. The students learned Chinese, Chinese philosophy, and Chinese history. They had textbooks printed on paper which were in both Chinese and Vietnamese. They read ''[[Four Books and Five Classics|The Four Books]]'' (''T\u1ee9 th\u01b0'', \u56db\u66f8): \"The Great Study\" (\u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ecdc, \u5927\u5b78), \"The Golden Means\" (Trung Dung, \u4e2d\u5eb8), \"The Analects\" (Lu\u1eadn Ng\u1eef, \u8ad6\u8a9e) and \"Mencius\" (M\u1ea1nh T\u1eed, \u5b5f\u5b50); ''[[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Pre-Confucian Classics]]'' (''Ng\u0169 Kinh'', \u4e94\u7d93): \"Book of Odes (Kinh Thi, \u8a69\u7d93), \"Book of Annals\" (Kinh Th\u01b0, \u66f8\u7d93), \"Book of Rites\" (Kinh L\u1ec5, \u79ae\u8a18), \"Book of Change\" (Kinh D\u1ecbch, \u6613\u7d93) and \"Book of Spring and Autumn\" (Kinh Xu\u00e2n Thu, \u6625\u79cb); ancient poetry and Chinese history among others.\n\nThe students enrolled for three to seven years. They had minor tests each month and four major tests per year. Success in the exams, certified by the Ministry of Rites (B\u1ed9 L\u1ec5, \u79ae\u90e8) qualified them to sit the national exam (H\u1ed9i Examination - ''Thi H\u1ed9i''). Success at the H\u1ed9i Examination qualified the student to sit the royal exam, the \u0110\u00ecnh Examination (''Thi \u0110\u00ecnh''), held at court. At this exam, the monarch himself posed the questions, responded to the candidate's answer and then ranked those who passed into different grades. The Imperial Academy was the largest centre in the country.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Fine arts===\n* Frederick Harris' painting, ''The Red Door'', is a watercolor of the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu - Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m, Hanoi<ref>{{cite web| website=Wired For Books| url=http://www.wiredforbooks.org/| title=Home page illustration| accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref> There are sometimes water puppet performances that tell about the history of Vietnam.

In 1972 he was appointed professor of physics at the [[University of Colorado]], Boulder, where he established a research program investigating [[ferroelectrics]] using laser spectroscopy. It was here that began his groundbreaking work on \"integrated ferroelectrics\" &mdash; semiconductor chips that incorporate thin ferroelectric memory devices. In 1984 he co-founded [[Symetrix]] Corporation to develop [[ferroelectric RAM]] (FRAM), which licensed its technology to [[Matsushita]]. There followed appointments as Dean at the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (1992) and the [[University of New South Wales]] (1995). In 1997, worked as a visiting professor in [[Yokohama]] thanks to an award from [[SONY]] and in [[Germany]] after receiving a [[Humboldt Research Award]]. In 1999, when he left Symetrix, he became professor of [[ferroics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] where his research focuses on multiferoed magnetoelectrics and nanometric methods.<ref name=\"SAZU\"/>.

After receiving his doctorate in physics from [[Ohio State University]] (1966) in the field of high resolution molecular [[spectroscopy]], he worked for six years in the Quantum Electronics Research Laboratory at [[Bell Laboratories]], New Jersey. In 1972 he was appointed professor of physics at the [[University of Colorado]], Boulder, where he established a research program investigating [[ferroelectrics]] using laser spectroscopy. It was here that began his groundbreaking work on \"integrated ferroelectrics\" &mdash; semiconductor chips that incorporate thin ferroelectric memory devices. In 1984 he co-founded [[Symetrix]] Corporation to develop [[ferroelectric RAM]] (FRAM), which licensed its technology to [[Matsushita]]. There followed appointments as Dean at the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (1992) and the [[University of New South Wales]] (1995). In 1997, worked as a visiting professor in [[Yokohama]] thanks to an award from [[SONY]] and in [[Germany]] after receiving a [[Humboldt Research Award]]. In 1999, when he left Symetrix, he became professor of [[ferroics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] where his research focuses on multiferoed magnetoelectrics and nanometric methods.<ref name=\"SAZU\"/>. Since 2015 he has been a joint professor in both chemistry and physics at the [[University of St Andrews]]. James Scott passed away on the 6th of April 2020 - he leaves a wife and three children.\n\n==Awards==\nHe was awarded the [[Materials Research Society]] gold medal in 2008 and Slovenia's [[Jo\u017eef Stefan]] gold medal in 2009.<ref name=\"cam\"/> He has been a member of the [[American Physical Society]] since 1974, a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] since 2008,<ref name=\"RS\"/> and a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] since 2011.<ref name=\"cam\"/> In 2014 he was listed by Thomson Reuters as [[Thomson Reuters Citation Laureates|among the most highly cited physicists]].<ref name=\"TRCL\">{{cite web | title=Physics | website=sciencewatch.com | date=24 April 2016 | url=http://sciencewatch.com/nobel/2014-predictions/physics-laureates | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230439/http://sciencewatch.com/nobel/2014-predictions/physics-laureates | archive-date=24 April 2016 | url-status=unfit | access-date=16 October 2018}}</ref>.
