The party has never been able to achieve vote share more than Turkey's 10 percent national election threshold. Thus, it did not have any opportunity to be represented in the parliament as a party. However, the party launched and carried out several political campaigns to build [[extra-parliamentary opposition]] in Turkey, often together with other left-wing groups and parties, civil society organizations and trade unions. Also, in different local elections, it had minor achievements in places like [[Hopa]].         \n\nToday the Left Party has no single leader. Instead, it is ruled by the Board of Presidents consisting of four members (including \u00d6nder \u0130\u015fleyen [official leader], Pelin Bekta\u015f, \u00c7i\u00e7ek \u00c7atalkaya ve \u0130lknur Ba\u015fer). \n\nBesides, the party is a member of [[Party of the European Left|the European Left]] and it is nationally affiliated with the [[United June Movement]]\n\n==History==\n\nIt was founded in 1996 as a merger of several [[left-wing]] groupings. In the [[1999 Turkish general election|1999 general election]], its first major electoral outing, the party polled 0.8% of the vote, falling far behind the 10% threshold required for parliamentary representation.  A deep internal crisis followed and by 2001, several of the initial groupings left. In 2002 elections, the party's share of the national vote fell further to 0.3%.\n\nIn the 2004 local elections, the \u00d6DP gained control of two [[town hall]]s in [[Artvin Province|Artvin]] and [[Yozgat Province|Yozgat]] provinces. In these elections, the \u00d6DP had joined an electoral coalition with the pro-Kurdish [[Democratic People's Party (Turkey)]] (DEHAP) and the left Social Democrat SHP ([[Sosyaldemokrat Halk Partisi]]). At the next 2009 local elections, Mithat Nehir was the sole victorious \u00d6DP candidate in the entire republic (17,723 votes for the whole country, i.e. 0.04%), and became mayor of the [[Samanda\u011f]] [[il\u00e7e|district]].<ref>[http://yerelsecim2009.hurriyet.com.tr/ilcedetay.aspx?cid=430&bs=1%20Results%20for%20Samanda\u011f Results for Samanda\u011f], [[H\u00fcrriyet]]</ref><ref>[http://yerelsecim2009.hurriyet.com.tr/partidetay.aspx?pid=19&sid=2%20\u00d6DP%20-%20Genel%20Bilgiler National results for the \u00d6DP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311025339/http://yerelsecim2009.hurriyet.com.tr/partidetay.aspx?pid=19 |date=2016-03-11 }}, [[H\u00fcrriyet]]</ref>\n\n[[Ufuk Uras]], who was then the president of the party was elected to the parliament from the independents' ticket, during the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]].  The party's formal lists, which hadn't fielded candidates in several key constituencies in support of the left-wing candidates standing on the independents' ticket, polled 0.15% in that poll.\n\nIn the 6th congress held on June 20, 2009, the delegates elected Alper Ta\u015f as the new leader, solely nominated as the chairmanship. Apart from the discussions on some political headlines, Party Assembly consisting of sixty people was also assigned. In this congress, the signals that the party will have a more anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist route were given.\n\nFormer chairman Ufuk Uras resigned from \u00d6DP on June 19, 2009, one day before the congress. During a press conference at Parliament, Uras said, \u201cWe are resigning together with the Freedom Left, who have worked in the founding of the party and held various positions at different times in the \u00d6DP -- from provincial and district branch administration to membership in the party council, central steering and discipline committees -- where we have been struggling since its founding for a historic meeting that overrides the existing structures.\u201d\n\nIn the 8th extraordinary congress in 22 December 2019, the party changed its name to Left Party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=odpadmin |first1=odpadmin |title=Kongremiz topland\u0131 ve ismimiz De\u011fi\u015fti: Yeni isim SOL PART\u0130 {{!}} \u00d6zg\u00fcrl\u00fck ve Dayan\u0131\u015fma Partisi |url=http://portal.odp.org.tr/kongremiz-toplandi-ve-ismimiz-degisti-yeni-isim-sol-parti/ |accessdate=23 December 2019 |language=tr-TR}}</ref>\n\n==Tendencies==\n\nThe Libertarian Socialist Platform within the Freedom and Solidarity Party is a successor to the [[Devrimci Yol|Dev Yol]] radical left-wing movement.<ref name=\"Gunterp83+247\">{{cite book|last1=Gunter|first1=Michael M.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Kurds|date=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Pub.

The party has never been able to achieve vote share more than Turkey's 10 percent national election threshold. Thus, it did not have any opportunity to be represented in the parliament as a party. However, the party launched and carried out several political campaigns to build [[extra-parliamentary opposition]] in Turkey, often together with other left-wing groups and parties, civil society organizations and trade unions. Also, in different local elections, it had minor achievements in places like [[Hopa]].         \n\nToday the Left Party has no single leader. Instead, it is ruled by the Board of Presidents consisting of four members (including \u00d6nder \u0130\u015fleyen [official leader], Pelin Bekta\u015f, \u00c7i\u00e7ek \u00c7atalkaya ve \u0130lknur Ba\u015fer). \n\nBesides, the party is a member of [[Party of the European Left|the European Left]] and it is nationally affiliated with the [[United June Movement]]\n\n==History==\n\nIt was founded in 1996 as a merger of several [[left-wing]] groupings. In the [[1999 Turkish general election|1999 general election]], its first major electoral outing, the party polled 0.8% of the vote, falling far behind the 10% threshold required for parliamentary representation.  A deep internal crisis followed and by 2001, several of the initial groupings left. In 2002 elections, the party's share of the national vote fell further to 0.3%.\n\nIn the 2004 local elections, the \u00d6DP gained control of two [[town hall]]s in [[Artvin Province|Artvin]] and [[Yozgat Province|Yozgat]] provinces. In these elections, the \u00d6DP had joined an electoral coalition with the pro-Kurdish [[Democratic People's Party (Turkey)]] (DEHAP) and the left Social Democrat SHP ([[Sosyaldemokrat Halk Partisi]]). At the next 2009 local elections, Mithat Nehir was the sole victorious \u00d6DP candidate in the entire republic (17,723 votes for the whole country, i.e. 0.04%), and became mayor of the [[Samanda\u011f]] [[il\u00e7e|district]].<ref>[http://yerelsecim2009.hurriyet.com.tr/ilcedetay.aspx?cid=430&bs=1%20Results%20for%20Samanda\u011f Results for Samanda\u011f], [[H\u00fcrriyet]]</ref><ref>[http://yerelsecim2009.hurriyet.com.tr/partidetay.aspx?pid=19&sid=2%20\u00d6DP%20-%20Genel%20Bilgiler National results for the \u00d6DP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311025339/http://yerelsecim2009.hurriyet.com.tr/partidetay.aspx?pid=19 |date=2016-03-11 }}, [[H\u00fcrriyet]]</ref>\n\n[[Ufuk Uras]], who was then the president of the party was elected to the parliament from the independents' ticket, during the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]].  The party's formal lists, which hadn't fielded candidates in several key constituencies in support of the left-wing candidates standing on the independents' ticket, polled 0.15% in that poll.\n\nIn the 6th congress held on June 20, 2009, the delegates elected Alper Ta\u015f as the new leader, solely nominated as the chairmanship. Apart from the discussions on some political headlines, Party Assembly consisting of sixty people was also assigned. In this congress, the signals that the party will have a more anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist route were given.\n\nFormer chairman Ufuk Uras resigned from \u00d6DP on June 19, 2009, one day before the congress. During a press conference at Parliament, Uras said, \u201cWe are resigning together with the Freedom Left, who have worked in the founding of the party and held various positions at different times in the \u00d6DP -- from provincial and district branch administration to membership in the party council, central steering and discipline committees -- where we have been struggling since its founding for a historic meeting that overrides the existing structures.\u201d\n\nIn the 8th extraordinary congress in 22 December 2019, the party changed its name to Left Party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=odpadmin |first1=odpadmin |title=Kongremiz topland\u0131 ve ismimiz De\u011fi\u015fti: Yeni isim SOL PART\u0130 {{!}} \u00d6zg\u00fcrl\u00fck ve Dayan\u0131\u015fma Partisi |url=http://portal.odp.org.tr/kongremiz-toplandi-ve-ismimiz-degisti-yeni-isim-sol-parti/ |accessdate=23 December 2019 |language=tr-TR}}</ref>\n\n==Tendencies==\n\nThe Libertarian Socialist Platform within the Freedom and Solidarity Party is a successor to the [[Devrimci Yol|Dev Yol]] radical left-wing movement.<ref name=\"Gunterp83+247\">{{cite book|last1=Gunter|first1=Michael M.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Kurds|date=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Pub.
