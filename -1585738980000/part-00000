Her husband, Eddie Kurnitz, needs to take a job as a traveling salesman to pay off the medical bills incurred, and decides to ask his stern and straight talking mother, from whom he is slightly estranged, if his two early-teen sons, Jay and Arty (who their Grandma insists on calling by their full given names, Jacob and Arthur, which she pronounces \"Yakob\" and \"Artur\"), can live with her and their Aunt Bella Kurnitz in Yonkers. She refuses.  After a threat by Bella, she lets them stay without ever saying they could stay. Despite their Grandma owning and operating a candy store, Jay and Arty don't like their new living situation as they're afraid of their Grandma, and find it difficult to relate to their crazy Aunt Bella, whose slow mental state is manifested by perpetual excitability and a short attention span, which outwardly comes across as a childlike demeanor. Into their collective lives returns one of Eddie and Bella's other siblings, Louie Kurnitz, a henchman for some gangsters. He is hiding out from Hollywood Harry, who wants what Louie stole and is hiding in his small black bag. Jay and Arty's mission becomes how to make money fast so that they can help their father and move back in together, which may entail stealing the $15,000 their Grandma has hidden somewhere. Bella's mission is to find a way to tell the family that she wants to marry Johnny, her equally slow movie theater usher boyfriend; the two could also use $5,000 of Grandma's hidden money to open their dream restaurant. And Louie's mission is to survive the next couple of days.\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Jay''': He is fifteen \"and a half\" years old. He insists on the \"and a half\". The death of his  mother forces him to be more mature than he is ready to be when his father leaves him and his younger brother with his family so he can sell scrap iron during World War Two. The play tells his coming-of-age story. \n\n'''Arty''': Jay's younger brother, he is 13 \"and a half\" years old. More of an observer than the rest of his family, he often goes with the flow of things, but also can be a little childish. Originally played on Broadway by [[Danny Gerard]].\n\n'''Bella''': Jay's thirty-five-year-old aunt. She is sometimes a bit off-center and is mentally challenged, but despite this she is also loving and protective of her nephews. Much of the second half of the play focuses on her attempts at independence from her stern mother. \n\n'''Louie''': Jay's flamboyant, jovial uncle, in his late 30s, who comes to live with the family when he is hiding from the local mob. He is considered by Grandma Kurnitz to be the \"survivor\" of the family. He has a strong, mercurial nature, and a certain underlying dark side, which the kids uncover in the second act of the play. He works as a \"bag-man\" for the mob. \n\n'''Grandma Kurnitz''': Jay's grandmother. A very old and stern woman, an immigrant from Germany. Owing to her harsh childhood, she has always been very intolerant of what in others she calls \"weaknesses\". She is blunt, sometimes even in a funny way, and always knows what is going on with the people around her. \n\n'''Eddie''': Jay's middle-aged father. After the death of his wife, he is forced to send his two sons to live with their grandmother, while he repays his large financial debts. He is shown to be, much like his sisters, a nervous wreck around Grandma. \n\n'''Gert''': Jay's aunt, and Grandma's daughter. She is a very interesting addition to the family. Her most noticeable issue is that when she breathes she has a tendency to suck in while still speaking, as a result of trauma instilled in her by Grandma from a young age.\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{main article|Lost in Yonkers (film)}}\nSimon adapted his play for a 1993 feature film directed by [[Martha Coolidge]], and starring Brad Stoll as Jay. Worth and Ruehl reprised their stage roles, and [[Richard Dreyfuss]] was cast as Louie. Bella's beau Johnny, an unseen character in the play, was portrayed by [[David Strathairn]].<ref>Maslin, Janet.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman. After her remarriage, Adelaide demonstrated no close relationship with her son.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]] after deposing the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]] during the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024.

Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}} The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary.

However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033.

Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire.

Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|Emperor Conrad II's tomb in the crypt of [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany]]\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, which was still under construction at this time. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today along with those of seven of his successors.\n\nA biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris'', was written by his chaplain [[Wipo of Burgundy]], and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{see also|Kings of Germany family tree}}\nConrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia.

of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman. After her remarriage, Adelaide demonstrated no close relationship with her son.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]] after deposing the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]] during the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was placed in Conrad's care.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\">{{cite book|author1=Lenelotte M\u00f6ller|author2=Hans Ammerich|title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|date=1 December 2015|publisher=marixverlag|isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5|pages=3\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nConrad married [[Gisela of Swabia]], a twice widowed [[duchess]], in 1016.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Gisela was the daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, unsuccessfully claimed the German throne following [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, losing the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024. Childless, Henry's death brought the [[Ottonian dynasty]], which had ruled Germany since 919, to an end.

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}} The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad launched an invasion of Hungary, but had to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass depiction, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops.

Charmelo. It stars [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]], [[Logan Browning]], and [[Steven Weber]].\n\nIt had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 20, 2018. It was released on May 24, 2019, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nCharlotte Willmore is a talented young [[cellist]] that was forced to leave Bachoff, a prestigious music school in [[Boston]], to care for her terminally ill mother. After her mother's death years later, Charlotte reaches out to Anton, the head of the academy, and travels to [[Shanghai]] to join Anton, his wife Paloma, and teachers Geoffrey and Theis in selecting a new student. Charlotte befriends Lizzie, Anton's star pupil who replaced Charlotte at Bachoff. After a night of clubbing, they return to Lizzie's hotel room and have sex.\n\nWhen Lizzie awakens with a [[hangover]], Charlotte offers her some [[ibuprofen]], which she takes with a shot of alcohol, and joins her on a trip through rural China. Boarding a bus after eating at a street food stall, Lizzie begins to feel progressively ill and takes more of Charlotte's ibuprofen. As her condition worsens, she throws up maggots and spirals into a panic, frightening the other passengers until the driver ejects her and Charlotte from the bus, stranding them in the countryside. Increasingly ill and paranoid, Lizzie sees bugs crawling inside her arm and eventually bursting out of her skin before Charlotte offers her a meat [[cleaver]], and Lizzie hacks off her infected right hand.\n\nIt is revealed that Charlotte drugged Lizzie with medication prescribed to Charlotte's late mother, which can induce hallucinations (especially when consumed with alcohol), stole the meat cleaver from the food stall, and manipulated Lizzie into cutting off her own hand.\n\nThree weeks later, Anton and Paloma give their new student from China, Zhang Li, a tour of Bachoff and the \"Chapel,\" an acoustically perfect room where the academy's best students perform. That night, Lizzie arrives unexpectedly, her right hand missing. She explains her recollection of events to Anton and Paloma, and that she was discovered unconscious on the side of the road with a makeshift [[tourniquet]] around her arm, keeping her alive. Lizzie is adamant that Charlotte orchestrated the incident out of jealousy. Anton, initially sympathetic, turns cold and informs Lizzie the next day that she must leave the academy. On her way out, she looks at the photos in the hall and smashes a framed picture of Charlotte.\n\nLizzie travels to [[Minneapolis]] to confront Charlotte in her home, having broken in and overpowers her with a taser before returning to Bachoff with Charlotte bound in the trunk of her car. When Charlotte awakens, she is confronted by Anton and reveals why she orchestrated Lizzie's dismemberment: the plot was spurred by Charlotte seeing a photo of Lizzie in a magazine with an eighth-note tattoo, a symbol for those indoctrinated into an elite group of students whom Anton and his peers [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] as part of a sex cult. Charlotte also bears the tattoo, having experienced years of rape and torture at the hands of Anton for failing to achieve musical \"Perfection,\" and planned Lizzie's amputation to save her from Bachoff, knowing that if she could no longer play the cello, Anton would have no use for Lizzie and discard her. Enraged, Anton brings Charlotte to the Chapel, where she is to perform for him, Paloma, Lizzie, Theis, Geoffrey, and an unwitting Zhang Li. She is seen sitting on the stage, chained by her ankles underneath a red dress, wearing red lipstick with her hair styled fancily. Anton states to Charlotte that if she plays a complicated piece without error, she will be free to leave. If she makes an error, Zhang Li will \"pay the price\" (presumably sexual abuse like what was inflicted on Charlotte). However, this is later revealed to be only a lie in order to throw Charlotte off her game.\n\nAfter the performance in which Charlotte erred, Anton, Paloma, and Zhang Li leave the Chapel, and Theis and Geoffrey bind Charlotte, preparing to [[Gang rape|gang-rape]] her. Lizzie threatens to rape Charlotte with her hand stump as revenge, but Theis and Geoffrey suddenly collapse and die. Lizzie and Charlotte kiss, and it is revealed the two conspired together, poisoning the men's drinks. Charlotte's plot to render Lizzie expendable to the academy resulted in Lizzie coming to her senses about Anton's [[brainwashing]], and together they plotted their revenge. Anton finds Paloma drugged and stabbed to death, and is confronted by Charlotte and Lizzie, armed with kitchen knives. They attack Anton, but he manages to wrest the knife from Charlotte, mutilating her arm before Lizzie knocks him unconscious.\n\nSome unspecified time later, Anton, his mouth and eyes sewn shut and limbs amputated, is forced to listen as Charlotte and Lizzie perform for him in the Chapel playing as one, each compensating for the other's missing hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]] as Charlotte\n** Molly Grace as Young Charlotte\n* [[Logan Browning]] as Lizzie\n** Milah Thompson as Young Lizzie\n* [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] as Anton, the head of Bachoff Academy.\n* [[Alaina Huffman]] as Paloma, Anton's wife\n* Mark Kandborg as Theis\n* Graeme Duffy as Geoffrey\n* Eileen Tian as Zhang Li\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2017, it was announced [[Miramax]] would produce and finance the film, with [[Richard Shepard]], directing from a screenplay by himself, Nicole Snyder and Eric Charmelo, with [[Bill Block]] producing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/richard-shepard-the-perfection-miramax-films-the-matador-1202168969/|title=Miramax Buys Richard Shepard's Next Pic, 'The Perfection'|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=September 13, 2017|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref> In October 2017, [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]] joined the cast of the film, with Stacey Reiss serving as a producer on the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/allison-willliams-the-perfection-director-richard-shepard-horror-thriller-1202196357/|title=Allison Willliams Toplines Horror Thriller 'The Perfection' For Director Richard Shepard|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anita|last=Busch|date=October 27, 2017|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref> In December 2017, [[Logan Browning]] joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/dear-white-people-logan-browning-allison-willliams-the-perfection-movie-1202229133/|title='Dear White People' Star Logan Browning Joins Allison Williams In 'The Perfection'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Amanda|last=N'Duka|date=December 18, 2017|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 20, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/fantastic-fest-the-perfection-fugue-allison-williams-logan-browning-1202465624/|title=Fantastic Fest Adds Horror 'The Perfection' And 'Fugue' To Lineup|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Dino|last=Day-Ramos|date=September 17, 2018|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Netflix]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/netflix-buys-allison-williams-the-perfection-horror-miramax-movie-1202477386/|title=Allison Williams & Logan Browning Miramax Thriller 'The Perfection' Snapped Up By Netflix|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=October 5, 2018|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref>\nIt was released on May 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/12/30/2019-movies/|title=Here's every 2019 movie release date so far|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Katie|last=Hasty|date=December 30, 2018|accessdate=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2019}}\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 88 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.55/10.
