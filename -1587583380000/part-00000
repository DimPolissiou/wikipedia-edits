However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine and his Bishop Alcuin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

This was the accepted position of Christian thought at this time.\n\n\n==High Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine and his Bishop Alcuin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A.

Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

The population was 14,892 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): North Reading town, Middlesex County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe area was first settled in 1651 when the town of [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] received a special land grant north of the [[Ipswich River]]. It was officially incorporated as the separate town of North Reading in 1853. \nNorth Reading borders [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]], [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middleton]], [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]], [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]], and [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]].\n\n\"Original grants of large farmsteads along the river during the mid-17th century brought six families to the settlement before 1680. The economy of the town in the 17th and 18th century was based on subsistence farming with limited hop production. There was a sawmill on Lob's Pond by 1694 and grist and saw mills at the village center by 1794. Some small scale boot and shoe making was underway by 1820, and by 1850 small sheds or shops to make shoes were attached to almost every house in town. These shops produced cheap footwear that was sold south to clothe slaves, and the Civil War destroyed the town's industry. The principal products of the town in the early 20th century were milk, apples and fruits.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of North Reading|url=http://www.northreadingma.gov/Pages/NReadingMA_WebDocs/about|publisher=Town of North Reading|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:North Reading Middle School Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|North Reading Middle School]]\n* [[North Reading High School]]\n* North Reading Middle School\n* [https://www.north-reading.k12.ma.us/little-elementary/about-us/pages/about-our-school E.

It was officially incorporated as the separate town of North Reading in 1853. \nNorth Reading borders [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]], [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middleton]], [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]], [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]], and [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]].\n\n\"Original grants of large farmsteads along the river during the mid-17th century brought six families to the settlement before 1680. The economy of the town in the 17th and 18th century was based on subsistence farming with limited hop production. There was a sawmill on Lob's Pond by 1694 and grist and saw mills at the village center by 1794. Some small scale boot and shoe making was underway by 1820, and by 1850 small sheds or shops to make shoes were attached to almost every house in town. These shops produced cheap footwear that was sold south to clothe slaves, and the Civil War destroyed the town's industry. The principal products of the town in the early 20th century were milk, apples and fruits.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of North Reading|url=http://www.northreadingma.gov/Pages/NReadingMA_WebDocs/about|publisher=Town of North Reading|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:North Reading Middle School Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|North Reading Middle School]]\n* [[North Reading High School]]\n* North Reading Middle School\n* [https://www.north-reading.k12.ma.us/little-elementary/about-us/pages/about-our-school E.

He was spotted by scouts at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] who signed Blake a year later. He struggled to force his way into the Villa side and went out on loan to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in 1982.

Ball was sacked in February 1991 as Stoke went on to record their worst league position of 14th in the third tier. Stoke's new manager [[Lou Macari]] only used Blake sparingly and later joined [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on loan in 1992.<ref name=NB/> He joined Bradford permanently and latter played for

The films re-conceptualize the nature of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship, presenting them as same-age lifelong best friends,<ref name=\"POLY1\"/>{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.7}} and establish their bond as a key plot element and mutual character motivation.<ref name=\"DOT\"/><ref name=\"POLY2\"/> As a result, a fandom developed in reaction to a supposed homoerotic subtext to Rogers' and Barnes' relationship.<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"MTV\"/>\n\nAcross the ''Captain America'' trilogy of films, Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' notes that Rogers continually \"rebel[s] against authority for the sake of Bucky's wellbeing, escalating from disobeying orders in [[World War II]], to becoming an international fugitive in ''Civil War''.\"<ref name=\"DOT\"/> The relationship serves as the driving plot to ''The Winter Soldier'', where Barnes' memory of Rogers causes him to overcome his conditioning as a brainwashed assassin;<ref name=\"MTV\"/> Barnes recalls his identity through Rogers' declaration of \"I'm with you till the end of the line\", a phrase repeated by Rogers and Barnes throughout the series as an expression of kinship.<ref name=\"SR\"/> Their relationship is again a central plot element in ''Civil War'', as Rogers protects Barnes after he is wrongly accused of committing a terrorist act.<ref name=\"BEAST\"/> That film also develops [[Sharon Carter]] as a love interest for Rogers; writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Joanna Robinson called the development the \"one flaw in the otherwise great\" film, arguing that the film's kiss between Rogers and Carter exists primarily to \"put the nail in the coffin of speculation\" around a homoerotic interpretation of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship.<ref name=\"VF2\"/> While Rogers and Barnes appear in both ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', comparably less time is spent on developing their relationship,<ref name=\"BUSTLE\"/><ref name=\"CB1\"/> with Robinson and other critics hypothesizing that their interactions were minimized to build popularity for [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] ([[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]) as he assumes the mantle of Captain America, and to emphasize the canonical love story between Rogers and [[Peggy Carter]].<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"DOG\"/><ref name=\"BEAT\"/>\n\n==Analysis and impact==\nStucky as a phenomenon in [[fandom]] emerged from online communities that produce [[Fan labor|fan works]]. These online communities are typically majority female, in contrast to the majority male mainstream comics fandom.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}} Fan works featuring Stucky cover a wide range of mediums, including [[fan art]], [[fanfiction]], and [[Vidding|fan videos]], and typically give prominence to emotional imagery and romantic subject material, as opposed to the action- and conflict-centered narratives of Marvel's comic and film source material.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}}{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=220}} Stucky fan works thus \"realize all the un-filmed narrative moments that fans want to see,\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} with depictions of Rogers' and Barnes' domestic life in 1940s New York \u2013 largely unexplored in canonical source material \u2013 being a common trope in Stucky fan works.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/> In lieu of canonical material than can be drawn from, these particular works often maintain a high degree of historical fidelity; ''Gay New York'', a sociological text by LGBT historian [[George Chauncey]], is noted as having been utilized by some fan creators to accurately depict aspects of [[LGBT history in New York#1900\u20131949|pre-war gay culture in New York City]], including real-life period-specific [[gay bar]]s that existed in Rogers' canonical Brooklyn neighborhood.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/>{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}}\n\nIn ''Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence: The Evolution of a National Icon'', author J. Richard Stevens argues that fans of Captain America use the character \"to reconstruct and reconfigure cultural significance in their own lives,\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=10}} noting that \"throughout the character's history, which contains messages from ultranationalist [[jingoism]] to a critique of the role of [[nationalism]] in the propagation of racism and terrorism, his narratives have provoked incredibly articulate responses.\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=2}} In the specific case of Stucky, Francesca Coppa argues that the fandom is a response to the unlikelihood of Marvel acknowledging a queer reading of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship in canon, and a desire by some fans to formulate what such an acknowledgement could look like.{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} Thus, Stucky represents both the [[objectification]] and [[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]] of Steve Rogers as character, \"with fans writing stories that flesh out his politics, his relationships past and present, his religion, and his sexuality.\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=223}} In this regard, Stucky as a phenomenon in [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] is notable in that it devotes significant focus to the characters' imagined homosexuality or bisexuality,{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}} in contrast to [[Slash fiction|slash fan works]] of the 1970s and 1980s that \"distanc[ed] beloved characters from the stereotypes and even the identity of gayness,\" opting to instead depict the characters as \"sharing a great, transcendent love that eliminated the boundaries of gender.\"{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.9}}\n\nThe popularity of Stucky in fandom has been widely commented on by mainstream pop culture and entertainment sources.<ref name=\"SR\"/><ref

hashtag became a viral [[Twitter trends|trending topic]] on Twitter,<ref name=\"Wrap\"/> and was widely covered by the mainstream press.<ref name=\"MetroUK\"/><ref name=\"EW\"/><ref name=\"AP\"/><ref name=\"WAPO\"/><ref name=\"TIME\"/> While the hashtag was ostensibly organized around fans who wished to see Stucky made canon, both it and #GiveElsaAGirlfriend were also broadly concerned with the lack of LGBT characters in media properties owned by [[Disney]], of which Marvel is a subsidiary.<ref name=\"Crush\"/><ref name=\"IO9\"/> The LGBT rights organization [[GLAAD]] commented that the hashtag was \"a sign that audiences are eager for significant LGBT characters in their superhero movies.\"<ref name=\"AP\"/>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' cited #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend as an example of how social media has altered the dynamic between creators and audiences, as the medium increases both the visibility of fan discussions and the willingness of creators to respond to these discussions.<ref name=\"THR\"/> In the specific case of #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the campaign \"highlights demographic shifts that have yet to be reflected

Movies are for people to relate to in whatever way they want,\" adding that \"I don't think of the character that way, though. But there's no right or wrong answer.\"<ref name=\"GQ\"/> Evans has separately remarked that Barnes is \"one of the more precious relationships for Steve Rogers [...] it's one of the few relationships that he can identify as anything we would call home,\"<ref name=\"MOVIEFONE\"/> which has been quoted by outlets in the context of their coverage of Stucky.<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"MOVIEFONE\"/><ref name=\"BUZZFEED1\"/> An image from a fan [[photo op]] of Evans and Stan at [[Wizard World Philadelphia]] posing with [[cosplay]]ers kissing while dressed as Rogers and Barnes went viral in 2016.<ref name=\"IO9\"/><ref name=\"OW\"/>\n\n[[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]], who co-directed four of the five MCU films in which Rogers and Barnes jointly appear, has described their relationship as a love story,<ref name=\"EMPIRE\"/> later stating that \"people have interpreted that relationship all kinds of ways, and it's great to see people argue about it what that relationship means to them. We will never define it as filmmakers, explicitly, but however people want to interpret it, they can interpret it.\"<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"MTV\"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]], who jointly wrote the ''Captain America'' film trilogy, ''Infinity War'', and ''Endgame'', likened Rogers and Barnes' relationship to a love story and described the characters as soulmates in the foreword of the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] edition of the comic book series ''[[Captain America: White]]''.<ref name=HCForeward>{{cite book|contributor-last1=Markus|contributor-first1=Christopher|contributor-last2=McFeely|contributor-first2=Stephen|contribution=Introduction |date=2016|title=Captain America: White|last1=Loeb|first1=Jeph | publisher=Marvel Comics|isbn=978-0785133766|ref=harv|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nOther individuals who have remarked positively on Stucky include writers [[Ed Brubaker]], who co-created the Winter Soldier with artist [[Steve Epting]],<ref name=\"BC\"/> and [[Mark Waid]], who remarked in an interview with Marvel regarding his 2016 run on the comic book series ''[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]'' that both Black Widow and Barnes \"have had a crush\" on Steve Rogers.<ref name=\"WAID\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirk/Spock]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite web |last1=Bahr |first1=Lindsey |title=GLAAD responds to #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend |url=http://apnews.com/8957b80de9f444b7bc7f91ecc8184cb7 |website=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=8 November 2019 |date=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BEAST\">{{cite web |last1=Yamato |first1=Jen |title=\u2018Captain America: Civil War\u2019 Star Sebastian Stan on Whether Bucky and Cap Are in Love |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/captain-america-civil-war-star-sebastian-stan-on-whether-bucky-and-cap-are-in-love |website=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=7 November 2019 |date=9 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BEAT\">{{cite web |last1=Steele |first1=Amanda |title=Queer Coding Bucky Barnes: Why the MCU Should Put Up |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/bucky-barnes-queer-coding/ |website=[[Comics Beat]] |accessdate=8 November 2019 |date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BC>{{cite web\n |url= https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/05/27/ed-brubaker-talks-captain-america/\n |title= Ed Brubaker Talks Captain America.

Though Rogers and Barnes have appeared in media dating to the 1940s, [[Fan labor|fan works]] depicting a romantic or sexual relationship between the characters grew substantially in popularity in the 2010s following their appearances in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Several individuals associated with Marvel, including Winter Soldier co-creator [[Ed Brubaker]], Barnes' actor [[Sebastian Stan]], and MCU director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]], have commented positively on Stucky. Critics and commentators have used the popularity of Stucky in [[fandom]] to remark on a range of topics, including the lack of [[LGBT]] characters in [[superhero films]] and the nature of fandom on social media.\n\n==Background==\n===Marvel Comics===\n[[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and [[Bucky Barnes]] first appeared in ''[[Captain America#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941), which establishes Rogers as Captain America and Barnes as his teenaged [[sidekick]]. Barnes would be killed in 1948 and would not re-appear until [[Captain America (vol. 5)|''Captain America'' (vol. 5)]] in 2005, where the character is [[comic book death|brought back from supposed death]] as the Winter Soldier, a brainwashed assassin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Richard |title=The American Superhero: Encyclopedia of Caped Crusaders in History |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1440861239 |page=102}}</ref> As a result of Barnes' extended absence from comics, and Rogers' initial characterization as a much older [[paternal]] figure to Barnes, the emergence of Stucky as a phenomenon in [[fandom]] is a relatively recent development;<ref name=\"POLY1\"/> in pre-social media [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] fandom of the early 2000s, Rogers was most commonly depicted with [[Tony Stark]] ([[Iron Man]]), the pairing typically abbreviated as \"Stony\" or \"Superhusbands\".<ref name=\"POLY1\"/>{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.8}}\n\nWhile hero-and-sidekick relationships in comics are frequently interpreted as having a [[homoerotic]] subtext \u2014 an argument infamously made by [[Fredric Wertham]] in his 1954 book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', which asserted that [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]'s relationship promotes homosexuality and pederasty \u2014 in Marvel [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], the relationship between Rogers and Barnes is strictly platonic, and is not depicted as sexual or romantic.{{sfn|Gillen|2009|pp=109}} Regardless, Rogers and Barnes are consistently depicted in-canon as having a deep and meaningful personal bond, with some critics likening their relationship as wartime compatriots to [[Achilles and Patroclus]].{{sfn|Gillen|2009|pp=109}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe===\n{{See also|Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 120\n | image1 = Chris Evans - Captain America 2 press conference (cropped2).jpg\n | alt1 = Actor Chris Evans at a press conference in 2014.\n | image2 = Sebastian Stan by Gage Skidmore 2 (cropped).jpg\n | width2 = 120\n | alt2 = Actor Sebastian Stan at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2019.\n | footer = Actors [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] (left) and [[Sebastian Stan]] (right), who portray Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes, respectively, in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).\n}}\n\nThe popularity of Stucky as a ship in fandom rose substantially following the introduction of Rogers and Barnes to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"POLY1\"/> where they have jointly appeared in five films: ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). The films re-conceptualize the nature of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship, presenting them as same-age lifelong best friends,<ref name=\"POLY1\"/>{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.7}} and establish their bond as a key plot element and mutual character motivation.<ref name=\"DOT\"/><ref name=\"POLY2\"/> As a result, a fandom developed in reaction to a supposed homoerotic subtext to Rogers' and Barnes' relationship.<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"MTV\"/>\n\nAcross the ''Captain America'' trilogy of films, Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' notes that Rogers continually \"rebel[s] against authority for the sake of Bucky's wellbeing, escalating from disobeying orders in [[World War II]], to becoming an international fugitive in ''Civil War''.\"<ref name=\"DOT\"/> The relationship serves as the driving plot to ''The Winter Soldier'', where Barnes' memory of Rogers causes him to overcome his conditioning as a brainwashed assassin;<ref name=\"MTV\"/> Barnes recalls his identity through Rogers' declaration of \"I'm with you till the end of the line\", a phrase repeated by Rogers and Barnes throughout the series as an expression of kinship.<ref name=\"SR\"/> Their relationship is again a central plot element in ''Civil War'', as Rogers protects Barnes after he is wrongly accused of committing a terrorist act.<ref name=\"BEAST\"/> That film also develops [[Sharon Carter]] as a love interest for Rogers; writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Joanna Robinson called the development the \"one flaw in the otherwise great\" film, arguing that the film's kiss between Rogers and Carter exists primarily to \"put the nail in the coffin of speculation\" around a homoerotic interpretation of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship.<ref name=\"VF2\"/> While Rogers and Barnes appear in both ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', comparably less time is spent on developing their relationship,<ref name=\"BUSTLE\"/><ref name=\"CB1\"/> with Robinson and other critics hypothesizing that their interactions were minimized to build popularity for [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] ([[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]) as he assumes the mantle of Captain America, and to emphasize the canonical love story between Rogers and [[Peggy Carter]].<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"DOG\"/><ref name=\"BEAT\"/>\n\n==Analysis and impact==\nStucky as a phenomenon in [[fandom]] emerged from online communities that produce [[Fan labor|fan works]]. These online communities are typically majority female, in contrast to the majority male mainstream comics fandom.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}} Fan works featuring Stucky cover a wide range of mediums, including [[fan art]], [[fanfiction]], and [[Vidding|fan videos]], and typically give prominence to emotional imagery and romantic subject material, as opposed to the action- and conflict-centered narratives of Marvel's comic and film source material.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}}{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=220}} Stucky fan works thus \"realize all the un-filmed narrative moments that fans want to see,\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} with depictions of Rogers' and Barnes' domestic life in 1940s New York \u2013 largely unexplored in canonical source material \u2013 being a common trope in Stucky fan works.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/> In lieu of canonical material than can be drawn from, these particular works often maintain a high degree of historical fidelity; ''Gay New York'', a sociological text by LGBT historian [[George Chauncey]], is noted as having been utilized by some fan creators to accurately depict aspects of [[LGBT history in New York#1900\u20131949|pre-war gay culture in New York City]], including real-life period-specific [[gay bar]]s that existed in Rogers' canonical Brooklyn neighborhood.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/>{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}}\n\nIn ''Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence: The Evolution of a National Icon'', author J. Richard Stevens argues that fans of Captain America use the character \"to reconstruct and reconfigure cultural significance in their own lives,\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=10}} noting that \"throughout the character's history, which contains messages from ultranationalist [[jingoism]] to a critique of the role of [[nationalism]] in the propagation of racism and terrorism, his narratives have provoked incredibly articulate responses.\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=2}} In the specific case of Stucky, Francesca Coppa argues that the fandom is a response to the unlikelihood of Marvel acknowledging a queer reading of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship in canon, and a desire by some fans to formulate what such an acknowledgement could look like.{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} Thus, Stucky represents both the [[objectification]] and [[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]] of Steve Rogers as character, \"with fans writing stories that flesh out his politics, his relationships past and present, his religion, and his sexuality.\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=223}} In this regard, Stucky as a phenomenon in [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] is notable in that it devotes significant focus to the characters' imagined homosexuality or bisexuality,{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}} in contrast to [[Slash fiction|slash fan works]] of the 1970s and 1980s that \"distanc[ed] beloved characters from the stereotypes and even the identity of gayness,\" opting to instead depict the characters as \"sharing a great, transcendent love that eliminated the boundaries of gender.\"{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.9}}\n\nThe popularity of Stucky in fandom has been widely commented on by mainstream pop culture and entertainment sources.<ref name=\"SR\"/><ref

hashtag was \"a sign that audiences are eager for significant LGBT characters in their superhero movies.\"<ref name=\"AP\"/>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' cited #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend as an example of how social media has altered the dynamic between creators and audiences, as the medium increases both the visibility of fan discussions and the willingness of creators to respond to these
