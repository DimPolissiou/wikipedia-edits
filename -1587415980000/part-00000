The latter is called [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]] because treated wastewater can be used for other purposes. The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), often referred to as a Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) or a [[Sewage Treatment Plant]] (STP).  Pollutants in municipal wastewater (households and small industries) are removed or broken down.\n\nThe treatment of wastewater is part of the overarching field of [[sanitation]].

Since disposal or reuse are the objectives of wastewater treatment, disposal or reuse options are the basis for treatment decisions. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary with the type of use or location of disposal. Transportation costs often make acceptable impurity concentrations dependent upon location of disposal, but expensive treatment requirements may encourage selection of a disposal location on the basis of impurity concentrations. Ocean disposal is subject to international treaty requirements. International treaties may also regulate disposal into rivers crossing international borders.

Some wastewaters require different and sometimes specialized treatment methods. At the simplest level, treatment of sewage and most wastewaters is carried out through separation of [[solid]]s from [[liquid]]s, usually by [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]].
