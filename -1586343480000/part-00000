Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=etuse>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"].

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]].

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.

In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters.

The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of events which caused the orbiter to disintegrate.<ref name=challenger_report_ch3>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch3.htm |title= Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter III: The Accident |publisher=NASA |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 14, 2020}}</ref> Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53&nbsp;\u00b0F (12&nbsp;\u00b0C) had been ignored by NASA managers.<ref name=challenger_report_ch6>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |publisher=Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' disintegrated during re-entry, killing its crew of seven, because of damage to the [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon]] leading edge of the wing caused during launch.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program.

The French word was derived from {{lang|fro|marche}} (\"frontier\"), itself descended from the [[Middle Latin]] {{lang|la|marca}} (\"frontier\"), from which the modern English words ''[[March (territory)|march]]'' and ''mark'' also descend.  The distinction between governors of frontier territories and interior territories was made as early as the founding of the [[Roman Empire]] when some provinces were set aside for administration by the senate and more unpacified or vulnerable provinces were administered by the emperor.  The titles \"[[duke]]\" and \"[[count]]\" were similarly distinguished as ranks in the [[Byzantine Empire|late empire]], with {{lang|la|dux}} (literally, \"leader\") being used for a provincial military governor and the rank of {{lang|la|comes}} (literally \"companion,\" that is, of the Emperor) given to the leader of an active army along the frontier.\n\n==Belgium==\nThe title of marquess in Belgium predates the French Revolution and still exists today.

Normally a '{{lang|es|marqu\u00e9s}} is addressed as \"Illustrious Sir\" ({{lang|es|Ilustr\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or}}), or if he/she is a grandee as \"Your Excellency\" ({{lang|es|Excelent\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or}}).

In times past, the distinction between a [[count]] and a marquess was that the land of a marquess, called a [[march (territory)|march]], was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a [[county]], often was not. As a result of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbours and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count. The title is ranked below that of a [[duke]], which was often largely restricted to the royal family.\n\nThe rank of marquess was a relatively late introduction to the British peerage: no [[marcher lord]]s had the rank of marquess, though some were [[earl]]s. On the evening of the [[Coronation of Queen Victoria]] in 1838, the Prime Minister [[Lord Melbourne]] explained to her why (from her journals):\n\n<blockquote>I spoke to Ld M. about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, & he said it was quite unprecedented.

He said that \"what originally appear to be ''Blonde''{{'}}s flaws \u2013 its loose ends and ambiguities \u2013 end up as its strengths,\" concluding that \"what gradually emerges is a record of enigmatic beauty, intoxicating depth and intense emotion.\"<ref name=\"Jonze\"/> According to ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' journalist Ryan Dombal, while ''Channel Orange'' had boasted a more eclectic range of styles, ''Blonde'' showed Ocean expressing his romantic, philosophical, and melancholic ideas and emotions over an especially spare musical backdrop, giving the record an intimacy that \"attracts the ear, bubbles the brain, raises the flesh\".<ref name=\"Dombal\"/>\n\n[[Neil McCormick]] was somewhat less enthusiastic. In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', he wrote that ''Blonde'' \"should be celebrated as part of a generational shift away from the obvious in pop\", while finding the record to be \"meandering, contemplative and introverted\", suggesting that it would be a laborious experience for some listeners.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s Andy Kellman deemed it \"undiluted and progressive\" but qualified his praise by stating that \"over the course of an hour, all the sparsely ornamented ruminations can be a bit of a chore to absorb, no matter how much one hangs on each line\".<ref name=all/> In ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] admired Ocean's reliance on his \"expressive and capable but unathletic voice\", the candid stories explored on \"Good Guy\" and \"Facebook Story\", and more aggressive songs such as \"Nights\". \"As on ''Channel Orange'', however, his angst is a luxury of leisure\", Christgau wrote, finding the details of Ocean's interpersonal lyrics occasionally relatable but more often \"specific to his social status\".<ref name=\"vice\"/> Andy Gill was more critical in ''[[The Independent]]'', deeming much of the music lethargic, aimless, and devoid of strong melodies.<ref name=andy>{{cite web|last=Gill|first=Andy|date=August 24, 2016|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/frank-ocean-blonde-review-a-trickling-bubblebath-of-an-album-that-ultimately-runs-lukewarm-a7207766.html|title=Frank Ocean, Blonde, album review: A trickling bubblebath of an album that ultimately runs lukewarm|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=August 26, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825174949/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/frank-ocean-blonde-review-a-trickling-bubblebath-of-an-album-that-ultimately-runs-lukewarm-a7207766.html|archivedate=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nAt the end of 2016, ''Blonde'' appeared on a number of critics' lists ranking the year's top albums.

The bartenders were Miller and van der Veer, since the liquor license was in their name.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bar was located in the bottom two levels of the building, and the floors were covered in sawdust, reminiscent of another local lesbian bar, [[Mona's Barrel House]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beemyn|first=Brett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSPcBlsjez8C&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=mona's+barrel+house&source=bl&ots=aHm-Cjm3uZ&sig=ACfU3U15LzVp5qUCHkNW3RgBmgiYUREhLQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj76aiM79foAhXJl3IEHT84DBcQ6AEwAXoECAwQKQ#v=onepage&q=mona's%20barrel%20house&f=false|title=Creating a Place For Ourselves: Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Community Histories|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-22241-3|language=en}}</ref> The two upper levels of the building were occupied by The Firenze Hotel, which was known as a location to meet with [[Sex worker|sex workers]]. Some local historians claimed that Tommy worked as a pimp.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to FoundSF: <blockquote>\"The 299 Broadway site was where businessmen from the nearby [[Financial District, San Francisco|financial district]] could find a willing hooker out of sight of prying eyes at places like Paoli\u2019s.

The hookers were the girlfriends of the butches who hung out there.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> </blockquote>In 1952, the bar moved to 529 Broadway Street, where it was renamed Tommy's Place. When this happened, Tommy's Place became connected with another lesbian bar, 12 Adler Place. The two bars shared a staircase and a liquor license. They were connected with a split-level [[mezzanine]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6cwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=tommy's+bar+lesbian+sf&source=bl&ots=xCIx07iOyH&sig=ACfU3U0Ewr8aljB3JH4GEC91mvJVSZDa1g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnn_LQ5NboAhXClHIEHdnLBs0Q6AEwB3oECAwQKQ#v=onepage&q=tommy's%20bar%20lesbian%20sf&f=false|title=Wide-Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965|date=2005-04-13|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24474-0|language=en}}</ref> This created a dynamic in which Tommy's Place was the upstairs location, where customers came to see entertainment. There was a corner bar that could accommodate about 15 people, tables for two along both walls, and framed photos of women on the walls.<ref name=\":4\" /> Meanwhile, 12 Adler was the downstairs lesbian pick-up bar,<ref name=\":3\" /> patronized by [[Butch and femme|butch and femme lesbians]]. The 12 Adler location was smaller and darker. Customers could enter the bar at either address, and choose which bar space to socialize in (although most women chose to socialized in 12 Adler).<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\n== 1954 Raid ==\nOn September 8, 1954, the [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco police]] raided Tommy's Bar. The rationale behind the raid was that the bar was accused of selling alcohol to minor girls. In total, three people were arrested in the raid: Grace Miller (owner/bartender), Joyce van der Veer (owner/bartender), and Jesse J. Winston. The three individuals were issued multiple charges: giving narcotics to minors, possessing narcotics, and contributing to the delinquency of minors.<ref name=\":1\" /> The case became a sensationalized news story, which was frequently covered by the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]. The first San Francisco Chronicle headline, on September 10th, proclaimed: \"S. F. Teen-Age Girls Tell of 'Vice Academy.'\" The trials of the three women lasted into 1955.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe three individuals received different rulings. On December 2, 1955, van der Veer was acquitted on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. This ruling enraged [[Parent\u2013teacher association|PTA]] groups across the region, and it emboldened them to rally for Tommy's Bar to lose its liquor license. Meanwhile, Miller was convicted of serving beer to minors. She was sentenced to six months in county jail. The worst sentencing, however, went to Jesse Winston, who was the only [[African Americans|African-American]] among the three. Winston received convictions on  four counts and was sentenced to serve between one and twenty years in [[San Quentin State Prison]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 1950s, mainstream American culture placed high value on heterosexual [[marriage]], the [[nuclear family]], defined [[Gender role|gender roles]], and [[Repression (psychology)|repressed]] [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]. Lesbian bars, by contrast, were seen as transgressive and a direct threat to such values. Furthermore, the fact that lesbians often congregated in bars lent to the association of lesbianism with drugs and alcohol consumption. For this reason, as written in ''Wide Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco from 1965, \"''The 1954 raid on Tommy's Place... illustrates the dynamic and highlights the vulnerabilities of San Francisco lesbian communities in the postwar era.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Closure ==\nTommy's Place/12 Adler Place closed in 1955. However, Tommy was known to continue to spend time in the North Beach neighborhood into the 1960s, where she ran the Broadway Parking concession. Her girlfriend allegedly became a heroin addict, and Tommy became a heroin dealer to help support her girlfriend's habit and financial needs.<ref name=\":3\" /> In August 1969, Tommy Vasu was convicted of selling heroin. She served a five year sentence at [[California Correctional Institution|Tehachapi State Prison]].

When this happened, Tommy's Place became connected with another lesbian bar, 12 Adler Place. The two bars shared a staircase and a liquor license. They were connected with a split-level [[mezzanine]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6cwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=tommy's+bar+lesbian+sf&source=bl&ots=xCIx07iOyH&sig=ACfU3U0Ewr8aljB3JH4GEC91mvJVSZDa1g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnn_LQ5NboAhXClHIEHdnLBs0Q6AEwB3oECAwQKQ#v=onepage&q=tommy's%20bar%20lesbian%20sf&f=false|title=Wide-Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965|date=2005-04-13|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24474-0|language=en}}</ref> This created a dynamic in which Tommy's Place was the upstairs location, where customers came to see entertainment.

The 12 Adler location was smaller and darker.

The rationale behind the raid was that the bar was accused of selling alcohol to minor girls. In total, three people were arrested in the raid: Grace Miller (owner/bartender), Joyce van der Veer (owner/bartender), and Jesse J. Winston. The three individuals were issued multiple charges: giving narcotics to minors, possessing narcotics, and contributing to the delinquency of minors.<ref name=\":1\" /> The case became a sensationalized news story, which was frequently covered by the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]. The first San Francisco Chronicle headline, on September 10th, proclaimed: \"S. F. Teen-Age Girls Tell of 'Vice Academy.'\" The trials of the three women lasted into 1955.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe three individuals received different rulings. On December 2, 1955, van der Veer was acquitted on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. This ruling enraged [[Parent\u2013teacher association|PTA]] groups across the region, and it emboldened them to rally for Tommy's Bar to lose its liquor license. Meanwhile, Miller was convicted of serving beer to minors. She was sentenced to six months in county jail. The worst sentencing, however, went to Jesse Winston, who was the only [[African Americans|African-American]] among the three. Winston received convictions on  four counts and was sentenced to serve between one and twenty years in [[San Quentin State Prison]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 1950s, mainstream American culture placed high value on heterosexual [[marriage]], the [[nuclear family]], defined [[Gender role|gender roles]], and [[Repression (psychology)|repressed]] [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]. Lesbian bars, by contrast, were seen as transgressive and a direct threat to such values. Furthermore, the fact that lesbians often congregated in bars lent to the association of lesbianism with drugs and alcohol consumption. For this reason, as written in ''Wide Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco from 1965, \"''The 1954 raid on Tommy's Place... illustrates the dynamic and highlights the vulnerabilities of San Francisco lesbian communities in the postwar era.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Closure ==\nTommy's Place/12 Adler Place closed in 1955. However, Tommy was known to continue to spend time in the North Beach neighborhood into the 1960s, where she ran the Broadway Parking concession. Her girlfriend allegedly became a heroin addict, and Tommy became a heroin dealer to help support her girlfriend's habit and financial needs.<ref name=\":3\" /> In August 1969, Tommy Vasu was convicted of selling heroin. She served a five year sentence at [[California Correctional Institution|Tehachapi State Prison]]. She was murdered shortly after her release.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Tommy's Place location became the Garden of Eden strip club. The 12 Adler Place location became [[Specs' Twelve Adler Museum Cafe]]. \n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n{{uncategorised|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove leading zero from dates", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy%27s_Place/12_Adler_Place"}
