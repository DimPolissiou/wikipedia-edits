The success of the program led to they also play and stuff yep they also drink a lot many overseas versions being created including in the [[United States|America]]s (broadcast by [[Country Music Television|CMT]]) (part of [[MTV Networks]]) the CMT episodes frequently rebroadcasting on [[MTV]]. There are also many other international foreign versions (listed below) including an Australian version, a New Zealand version, and a German ([[German language]])-version titled \"Die strengsten Eltern der Welt\" (The Strictest Parents of the World). As well other locales to have locally produced adaptations include Scandinavia, Turkey, and Poland.\n\nThe series won an [[International Emmy Award for best Non-Scripted Entertainment]]. The concept is that two unruly teenagers are sent to live with a strict host family either locally or abroad for a week in an attempt to change their attitudes, outlooks, and behaviours in general. During the week they receive an impact letter from their real parents with a list of issues they should try to resolve.\n\nSince 2013, the official YouTube channel has been uploading small snippet clips from many of the episodes, largely the UK, US and Australian broadcasts: however, these snippets, in some cases, were just whole episodes broken into smaller notable highlights of an episode. As of 2019, this has been extended to entire episodes, starting with the UK version and then moving to the Australian version. These episodes, in some cases, are not complete re-uploads of the broadcast: for example, the rundown of the teens at the beginning has been cut in some cases, depending on the teens who were broadcast in the episode. In addition, some censorship has been done, notably with family names. The censorship has taken the form of either blurring of the surname (if included) or names being bleeped in the audio tracks. Alongside these edits, the ending credits sequence is not included.\n\n==United Kingdom - Original version==\nUnruly British teenagers are sent to live with strict families in an experiment to try to change their behaviour. Generally they spend 10 days, later 7 days, with their host parents trying to live by the latter's rules.\n\nAll series episodes were broadcast on a weekly basis.\n\n===Series 1 (2008)===\n{|class=wikitable\n!Episode!!First Aired!!Teenagers!!Family!!Notes!!BBC Episode Guide\n|-\n|1||18 September||Naomi Fisher (16, [[Brighton]]), and Ross Torrie (16, [[Southend]])||Mark and Lynn Garnett (A pharmaceutical company worker and part-time teacher) in [[Alabama]], USA||In the first episode, the teenagers, Ross and Naomi, are both the same age.

The success of the program led to many overseas versions being created including in the [[United States|America]]s (broadcast by [[Country Music Television|CMT]]) (part of [[MTV Networks]]) the CMT episodes frequently rebroadcasting on [[MTV]]. There are also many other international foreign versions (listed below) including an Australian version, a New Zealand version, and a German ([[German language]])-version titled \"Die strengsten Eltern der Welt\" (The Strictest Parents of the World). As well other locales to have locally produced adaptations include Scandinavia, Turkey, and Poland.\n\nThe series won an [[International Emmy Award for best Non-Scripted Entertainment]]. The concept is that two unruly teenagers are sent to live with a strict host family either locally or abroad for a week in an attempt to change their attitudes, outlooks, and behaviours in general. During the week they receive an impact letter from their real parents with a list of issues they should try to resolve.\n\nSince 2013, the official YouTube channel has been uploading small snippet clips from many of the episodes, largely the UK, US and Australian broadcasts: however, these snippets, in some cases, were just whole episodes broken into smaller notable highlights of an episode. As of 2019, this has been extended to entire episodes, starting with the UK version and then moving to the Australian version. These episodes, in some cases, are not complete re-uploads of the broadcast: for example, the rundown of the teens at the beginning has been cut in some cases, depending on the teens who were broadcast in the episode. In addition, some censorship has been done, notably with family names. The censorship has taken the form of either blurring of the surname (if included) or names being bleeped in the audio tracks. Alongside these edits, the ending credits sequence is not included.\n\n==United Kingdom - Original version==\nUnruly British teenagers are sent to live with strict families in an experiment to try to change their behaviour. Generally they spend 10 days, later 7 days, with their host parents trying to live by the latter's rules.\n\nAll series episodes were broadcast on a weekly basis.\n\n===Series 1 (2008)===\n{|class=wikitable\n!Episode!!First Aired!!Teenagers!!Family!!Notes!!BBC Episode Guide\n|-\n|1||18 September||Naomi Fisher (16, [[Brighton]]), and Ross Torrie (16, [[Southend]])||Mark and Lynn Garnett (A pharmaceutical company worker and part-time teacher) in [[Alabama]], USA||In the first episode, the teenagers, Ross and Naomi, are both the same age.

When Hunter Garnett catches them and when they get home, Mark Garnett loses his temper and punishes the teens by sending them straight to bed early.

Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''.

This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul (film)|Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes. Lansbury would find later fame in a similar role as [[Jessica Fletcher]].\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the [[Russian language]] [[Mosfilm]] adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story ''Murder Is Easy'', playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.\n\n===Joan Hickson===\n{{Main article|Miss Marple (TV series)}}\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''Miss Marple''.

[[Geraldine McEwan]] starred in the first three series. [[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations change the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.<ref name=\"agathachristie.com\">{{cite web|url=http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|title=Characters \u2013 Miss Marple|work=Agatha Christie|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010144904/http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChristie may have taken the name from [[Marple railway station]], through which she passed, or from Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at [[Abney Hall]].<ref name=\"Cheshire Life\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire-1-1631050 | title=Was Miss Marple Born in Cheshire? | date=15 September 2010 | publisher=Cheshire Life | accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php \"Marple's Profile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126123518/http://poirot.us/mprofile.php |date=26 November 2010 }}, Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.</ref>\n\n==Character==\nThe character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones.

In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, <blockquote> The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality.... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\">Bakshtein, Joseph. \"A View from Moscow,\" ''Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986'', eds.

They can be difficult to classify because often they were not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit.\n\n===Lianozovo Group===\n\nThe  Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 was  named after the small village [[Lianozovo District|Lianozovo]] outside Moscow, where most of the artists lived and worked.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artathhar.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/under-the-iron-curtain-modern-art-from-the-soviet-bloc/ |title=Under the Iron Curtain: Modern Art from the Soviet Bloc |last=artathhar |date=2012-12-16 |website=Derfner Judaica Museum + The Art Collection Exhibition Catalogues |language=en |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The members of this group were: Evgenii Kropivnitsky {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, the artist and poet, Olga Potapova {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430}}, [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Lidiya Masterkova|Lidia Masterkova]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], Nikolai Vechtomov  and the poets Vsevolod Nekrasov {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, [[Genrikh Sapgir]], and [[Igor Kholin]].

Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the [[Manezh]] exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, [[Victor Tupitsyn]] points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues.<ref name=\"Tupitsyn\"/> \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the [[Bulldozer Exhibition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/30/russian-painters-traitors-exhibit-london |title=Russian painters denounced as Soviet traitors exhibit in London |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2010-11-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Sretensky Boulevard Group===\n[[File:Pered_rasvetom.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Oleg Vassiliev (painter)|Oleg Vasiliev]], Before the Sunrise, 1964'']]\nA group of artists that had studios on and around [[Sretensky Boulevard]], Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s.

The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/viktor_pivovarov_breaking_the_ice.htm |title=Viktor Pivovarov - Artist's Profile - The Saatchi Gallery |website=www.saatchigallery.com |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Conceptualists===\n\nMany of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the [[Moscow Conceptualists|Moscow Conceptualist]] school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\"/>\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"<ref>Roberts, Norma, ed.

The official name of the exhibition was ''Exhibition of the artist-workers of the economic part of the Hermitage: Towards the 200th anniversary of Hermitage'' and it included the work of Chemiakin, V. Kravchenko, V. Uflyand, V. Ovchinnikov and O. Liagatchev. Opening on March 30\u201331, it was closed by the authorities on April 1.

Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, <blockquote> The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality.... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\">Bakshtein, Joseph. \"A View from Moscow,\" ''Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986'', eds.

Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the [[Manezh]] exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, [[Victor Tupitsyn]] points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues.<ref name=\"Tupitsyn\"/> \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the [[Bulldozer Exhibition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/30/russian-painters-traitors-exhibit-london |title=Russian painters denounced as Soviet traitors exhibit in London |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2010-11-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Sretensky Boulevard Group===\n[[File:Pered_rasvetom.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Oleg Vassiliev (painter)|Oleg Vasiliev]], Before the Sunrise, 1964'']]\nA group of artists that had studios on and around [[Sretensky Boulevard]], Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s.

The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects.

This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\"/>\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"<ref>Roberts, Norma, ed.

They spoke the [[Lusitanian language]], of which only a few short written fragments survive. Most Portuguese consider the Lusitanians as their ancestors.

The speakers of Proto-Italic and Proto-Celtic later moved southwards.]]\nIt has been hypothesized that the [[Lusitanians]] may have originated in the [[Alps]] and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Some modern scholars consider them to be indigenous and initially dominated by the [[Celt]]s, before gaining full independence from them. The archaeologist Scarlat Lambrino proposed that they were originally a tribal [[Celts|Celtic]] group, related to the [[Lusones]].\n\nThe first area settled by the [[Lusitanians]] was probably the Douro valley and the region of [[Beira Alta (region)|Beira Alta]]; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the [[Tagus river]], before being conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\nThe original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of [[Asturias]] and [[Gallaecia]] but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the ''Provincia Tarraconensis'' in the north, while the south remained the ''Provincia Lusitania et [[Vettones]]''. After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through ''Salmantica'' and ''Caesarobriga'' to the ''Anas'' ([[Guadiana]]) river.\n\nThe Lusitanian ethnicity and particularly, their language is not totally certain. They originated from either [[Proto-Celtic]] or [[Proto-Italic]] populations who spread from Central Europe into western Europe after new Yamnaya migrations into the Danube Valley,{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp= 108 f.}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp= 345, 361\u2013367}} while [[Proto-Germanic]] and [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]] may have developed east of the Carpathian mountains, in present-day Ukraine,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp= 368, 380}} moving north and spreading with the [[Corded Ware culture]] in Middle Europe (third millennium BCE).{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp= 108, 244\u2013250}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p= 360}} Alternatively, a European branch of Indo-European dialects, termed \"North-west Indo-European\" and associated with the Beaker culture, may have been ancestral to not only Celtic and Italic, but also to Germanic and Balto-Slavic.<ref name=\"Mallory (2013)\">{{cite conference | author = James P.

Three years later (147 B.C.), [[Viriathus]] became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. He commanded a confederation of Celtic tribes<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Portugal|title=Portugal - History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> and prevented the Roman expansion through guerrilla warfare. In 139 B.C. Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), [[Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus]], bribed by [[Marcus Popillius Laenas]].

In fact, in colonial Brazil the Portuguese men competed for the women, because among the [[Afro-Brazilians|African slaves]] the female component was also a small minority.<ref name=Ribeiro>Ribeiro, Darcy.

The Indian and African women were \"dominated\" by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better [[quality of life]] and therefore a lower [[mortality rate]] than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (3.2 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 3.6 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the \"white\" population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the \"non-white\" population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal.<ref name=Ribeiro /> After [[Independence of Brazil|independence from Portugal]] in 1822, around 1.7 million Portuguese immigrants settled in Brazil.<ref name=Ribeiro /> \n\nPortuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. The immigrants opted mostly for [[urban center]]s. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country.

As a result of [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Conquest of the Iberian peninsula (219\u201318 BC)|Roman colonization]], the Portuguese language stems primarily from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the subsequent [[colonization]] of territories in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]], as well as historical and recent [[emigration]], Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe, and a large [[Portuguese diaspora]] exists.\n\nPortuguese people began an [[Age of Exploration]] which started in 1415 with the [[conquest of Ceuta]] and culminated in an empire with territories that are now part of over 50 countries. The [[Portuguese Empire]] lasted nearly 600 years, seeing its end when [[Macau]] was returned to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1999.

Current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that modern-day Portuguese trace a proportion of these lineages to the [[paleolithic]] peoples who began settling the European continent between the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last glaciation]] around 45,000 years ago.[[File:Y-Haplogroup R1 distribution.png|thumb|left|Distribution of [[R1a]] (purple) and '''[[R1b]]''' (red).

Some modern scholars consider them to be indigenous and initially dominated by the [[Celt]]s, before gaining full independence from them. The archaeologist Scarlat Lambrino proposed that they were originally a tribal [[Celts|Celtic]] group, related to the [[Lusones]].\n\nThe first area settled by the [[Lusitanians]] was probably the Douro valley and the region of [[Beira Alta (region)|Beira Alta]]; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the [[Tagus river]], before being conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\nThe original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of [[Asturias]] and [[Gallaecia]] but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the ''Provincia Tarraconensis'' in the north, while the south remained the ''Provincia Lusitania et [[Vettones]]''. After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through ''Salmantica'' and ''Caesarobriga'' to the ''Anas'' ([[Guadiana]]) river.\n\nThe Lusitanian ethnicity and particularly, their language is not totally certain.

They defended themselves bravely for years, causing the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invaders serious defeats. In 150 B.C., they were defeated by Praetor [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Servius Galba]]: springing a clever trap, he killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves further northeast in the newly conquered Roman provinces in [[Gaul]] (modern [[France]]) by [[Julius Caesar]].  Three years later (147 B.C.), [[Viriathus]] became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. He commanded a confederation of Celtic tribes<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Portugal|title=Portugal - History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> and prevented the Roman expansion through guerrilla warfare. In 139 B.C. Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), [[Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus]], bribed by [[Marcus Popillius Laenas]]. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward by the Romans, the Consul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio|Servilius Caepio]] ordered their execution, declaring, \"Rome does not pay traitors\".\n\n[[Viriathus]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IY5ABAAAQBAJ&pg=PT76&lpg=PT76&dq=viriathus+lusitanian+celtic+hero+academic#v=onepage&q=viriathus+lusitanian+celtic+hero+academic&f=false|title=Viriathus: and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome 155-139 BC|first=Luis|last=Silva|date=30 July 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|via=Google Books|isbn=9781473826892}}</ref> is the first \u2018national hero\u2019 for the Portuguese as [[Vercingetorix]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vercingetorix|title=Vercingetorix &#124; Gallic chieftain|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> is for the French or [[Boudicca]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Boudicca|title=Boudicca &#124; History, Facts, & Death|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> for the English.\nAfter Viriathus' rule, the [[celticized]] Lusitanians became largely [[romanized]], adopting Roman culture and the language of [[Latin]]. The Lusitanian cities, in a manner similar to those of the rest of the Roman-Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of \"Citizens of Rome\".

The Portuguese migration was strongly marked by the predominance of [[men]] (colonial reports from the 16th and 17th centuries almost always report the absence or rarity of Portuguese [[women]]). This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary.<ref name=\"ensinarhistoria\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ensinarhistoriajoelza.com.br/desmundo-o-brasil-do-sec-xvi/|title=Desmundo de Alain Fresnot, o Brasil no s\u00e9culo XVI|publisher=ensinarhistoria|access-date=22 April 2016|date=27 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda (1996)|publisher=companhiadasletras.com.br|access-date=22 April 2016}}</ref> The Crown responded by sending groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants.

''\u00d3rf\u00e3s d'El-Rei'' (modern Portuguese ''\u00f3rf\u00e3s do rei'') literally translates to \"Orphans of the King\", and they were Portuguese female orphans in nubile age.{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}} There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown.{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}} Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551.{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}} The multiplication of [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s of Portuguese settlers also happened to a large degree through [[miscegenation]] with [[Black people|black]] and [[amerindian]] women. In fact, in colonial Brazil the Portuguese men competed for the women, because among the [[Afro-Brazilians|African slaves]] the female component was also a small minority.<ref name=Ribeiro>Ribeiro, Darcy. O Povo Brasileiro, Companhia de Bolso, fourth reprint, 2008 (2008)</ref> This explains why the Portuguese men left more descendants in Brazil than the Amerindian or African men did. The Indian and African women were \"dominated\" by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better [[quality of life]] and therefore a lower [[mortality rate]] than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (3.2 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 3.6 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the \"white\" population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the \"non-white\" population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal.<ref name=Ribeiro /> After [[Independence of Brazil|independence from Portugal]] in 1822, around 1.7 million Portuguese immigrants settled in Brazil.<ref name=Ribeiro /> \n\nPortuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. The immigrants opted mostly for [[urban center]]s. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the more recent influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol6_n2_1989/vol6_n2_1989_2artigo_17_37.pdf |title=A Integra\u00e7\u00e3o social e econ\u00f3mica dos emigrantes portugueses no Brasil |access-date=25 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230163157/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol6_n2_1989/vol6_n2_1989_2artigo_17_37.pdf |archive-date=30 December 2016  }}</ref> The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ich.unito.com.br/materia/resource/download/41917|title=Retrato Molecular- Gen\u00e9tica|website=Ich.unito.com|access-date=2 August 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or Italians<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ncc7WLAXlmQC |page=99 }} |title=Do outro lado do Atl\u00e2ntico: um s\u00e9culo de imigra\u00e7\u00e3o italiana no Brasil |publisher= |date= |access-date=25 August 2014}}</ref> who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community).

Publishing companies, distributors, and other proprietors often arrive to exhibit and/or sell their newest products to fans. Wares can include graphic novels, manga, anime media, [[action figures]], apparel or pre-made costumes, music CDs, software, decorations, toys, art books, specialty foods, and many more.\n\nThere are also art shows at anime conventions. The shows are similar to those at a traditional museum or gallery. Artwork of all kind is put on display for inspection, and in some cases for purchase/auction bidding, by the viewer. Entry is usually only restricted by space available & registration with the convention. The artist can choose to be present to display, discuss, or take commission in a variation of the art show known as the Artists' Alley. Artists may also include crafts, drawn art, self-published books or video, fanzines, and more.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of anime conventions]]\n* ''[[Otaku Unite!]]'', a 2004 documentary on otaku, with coverage of anime conventions\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Anime conventions}}\n*[https://animecons.com/ AnimeCons.com]\n*[http://www.upcomingcons.com/anime-cons UpcomingCons.com Anime Cons List]\n*[http://www.neoengel.com/con_rules.html A list of convention rules / guidelines]\n\n{{Fandom}}\n\n[[Category:Anime conventions| Anime convention]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fan convention on  Anime, Manga and Japanese culture in general}}\n[[Image:AnimeExpo2004 Roof Shot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Outside the convention hall at [[Anime Expo]] 2004.]]\nAn '''anime convention''' is an event or gathering with a primary focus on [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]].

There are also workshops that are like panels but are more geared towards instructions through a major or specific task such as how to draw [[manga]], make computer animation, or how to become a voice actor. Another event at most anime conventions include screenings of actual anime shows that can last through the day.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uY8700WJy_gC&pg=PA209&dq=anime+convention#v=onepage&q=anime%20convention&f=false|title=Understanding Manga and Anime|author=Robin E.

Contests can focus around costumes (or [[cosplay]]), art works (drawn, sculpted, painted), anime-related music videos, video games, dice games, card games, and many other activities. In some cases, tangible prizes have been offered as winnings in these contests. An ''Exhibit Hall'' or ''Dealers' Room'' is also popular at anime conventions. Publishing companies, distributors, and other proprietors often arrive to exhibit and/or sell their newest products to fans. Wares can include graphic novels, manga, anime media, [[action figures]], apparel or pre-made costumes, music CDs, software, decorations, toys, art books, specialty foods, and many more.\n\nThere are also art shows at anime conventions. The shows are similar to those at a traditional museum or gallery. Artwork of all kind is put on display for inspection, and in some cases for purchase/auction bidding, by the viewer. Entry is usually only restricted by space available & registration with the convention. The artist can choose to be present to display, discuss, or take commission in a variation of the art show known as the Artists' Alley. Artists may also include crafts, drawn art, self-published books or video, fanzines, and more.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of anime conventions]]\n* ''[[Otaku Unite!]]'', a 2004 documentary on otaku, with coverage of anime conventions\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Anime conventions}}\n*[http://animecons.com/ AnimeCons.com]\n*[http://www.upcomingcons.com/anime-cons UpcomingCons.com Anime Cons List]\n*[http://www.neoengel.com/con_rules.html A list of convention rules / guidelines]\n\n{{Fandom}}\n\n[[Category:Anime conventions| Anime convention]]\n", "name_user": "PDelahanty", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:http to https on AnimeCons.com link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_convention"}

Temporarily allowed sites won't be added to the permanent whitelist, and work only until the browser session ends. Active content may consist of [[JavaScript]], web fonts, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]], and other [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]. The add-on also offers specific countermeasures against security exploits.<ref name=\"about.com\">{{cite web |url=http://browsers.about.com/od/48/gr/noscript.htm |title=NoScript |author=Scott Orgera |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:NoScript screenshot.png|thumb|right|The classic NoScript menu in Firefox]]\nNoScript blocks JavaScript, Java, Flash, Silverlight, and other \"active\" content by default in Firefox. This is based on the assumption that websites can use these technologies in harmful ways. Users can allow active content to execute on trusted websites, by giving explicit permission, on a temporary or a more permanent basis. If \"Temporarily allow\" is selected, then scripts are enabled for that site until the browser session is closed.\n\nBecause many web browser attacks require scripting, configuring the browser to have scripting disabled by default reduces the chances of exploitation. Blocking plug-in content, as well, helps to mitigate any vulnerabilities in plug-in technologies, such as Java, Flash, Acrobat, and so on. NoScript will replace these blocked elements with a placeholder icon. Clicking on this icon enables the element.<ref name=\"cert\">{{cite web |url=http://cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/#Mozilla_Firefox |title=Securing Your Web Browser |author=Will Dormann and Jason Rafail |date=2008-02-14 |publisher=CERT |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>\n\nNoScript takes the form of a [[toolbar]] icon or [[status bar]] icon in Firefox.

Sources of scripts and other active content are listed by domain name, less often by IP address. Domains that are not whitelisted, are blocked by default, save for a built-in pre-approved whitelist that can later be edited.\n\nOften, domain names that would offer active content, are not identical to the domain name shown in the address field of the displayed web page. This is because many web pages and web applications fetch elements such as [[HTML element#Frames|iframes]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], scripts, and embeddable objects from remote sites. When a web page includes scripts and other blockable elements from many sources, the user may specify a blocking policy for the main address and each of the domains separately.\n\nNo scripts are executed, if the address of the ''main page'' has been marked as untrusted. Once any source is marked as trusted, NoScript will regard it as 'trusted', even if it is loaded indirectly by web pages or scripts originating from other domains.\n\nThe names of certain domains often indicate the purpose of the scripts they might serve, for example, domains from online advertising and tracking firms. This gives users the ability to very specifically not to allow domains that they do want active content to run from.  This is a trial-and-error process. Upon allowing (trusting) the domain of a website, the entire web page is reloaded by default, and the process of having to allow further domains with necessary scripts must then be repeated, as additional domains that would offer active content, may be listed after allowing the previous domain.<ref>{{cite web |title=NoScript features |url=https://noscript.net/features |website=NoScript |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NoScript FAQ |url=https://noscript.net/faq |website=NoScript |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe possibility to allow scripts coming from a certain source only for specific ''main page'' locations has been requested frequently, but is not yet easy to configure. It may be achieved in classic NoScript by configuring the built-in [[#Application Boundaries Enforcer (ABE)|ABE]] module to fine-tune cross-site resource access.<ref>[https://noscript.net/faq#qa8_10 Can I use ABE to fine-tune NoScript's permissions?] ''NoScript.net''.

By enabling a domain (e.g. mozilla.org), all its subdomains are implicitly enabled (e.g. www.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org and so on) with every possible protocol (e.g. HTTP and https). By enabling an address (protocol://host, e.g. <nowiki>https://mozilla.org</nowiki>), its subdirectories are enabled (e.g. <nowiki>https://mozilla.org/firefox</nowiki> and <nowiki>https://mozilla.org/thunderbird</nowiki>), but not its domain ancestors nor its siblings.

active (executable) web content, which a user can wholly or partially unblock by [[whitelist]]ing a site or domain from the extension's toolbar menu: Sites can be set as 'allowed', 'trusted', or 'untrusted', and the whitelist persists between sessions. Temporarily allowed sites won't be added to the permanent whitelist, and work only until the browser session ends. Active content may consist of [[JavaScript]], web fonts, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]], and other [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]. The add-on also offers specific countermeasures against security exploits.<ref name=\"about.com\">{{cite web |url=http://browsers.about.com/od/48/gr/noscript.htm |title=NoScript |author=Scott Orgera |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:NoScript screenshot.png|thumb|right|The classic NoScript menu in Firefox]]\nNoScript blocks JavaScript, Java, Flash, Silverlight, and other \"active\" content by default in Firefox. This is based on the assumption that websites can use these technologies in harmful ways. Users can allow active content to execute on trusted websites, by giving explicit permission, on a temporary or a more permanent basis. If \"Temporarily allow\" is selected, then scripts are enabled for that site until the browser session is closed.\n\nBecause many web browser attacks require scripting, configuring the browser to have scripting disabled by default reduces the chances of exploitation. Blocking plug-in content, as well, helps to mitigate any vulnerabilities in plug-in technologies, such as Java, Flash, Acrobat, and so on. NoScript will replace these blocked elements with a placeholder icon. Clicking on this icon enables the element.<ref name=\"cert\">{{cite web |url=http://cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/#Mozilla_Firefox |title=Securing Your Web Browser |author=Will Dormann and Jason Rafail |date=2008-02-14 |publisher=CERT |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>\n\nNoScript takes the form of a [[toolbar]] icon or [[status bar]] icon in Firefox. It displays on every website to denote whether NoScript has either blocked, allowed, or partially allowed scripts to run on the web page being viewed. Clicking or hovering (since version 2.0.3rc1<ref>{{cite web |title=NoScript Changelog 2.0.3rc1 |url=https://noscript.net/changelog#2.0.3rc1 |publisher=noscript.net |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>) the mouse cursor on the NoScript icon gives the user the option to allow or forbid the script's processing.\n\nNoScript's interface, whether accessed by right-clicking on the web page or the distinctive NoScript box at the bottom of the page (by default), shows the URL of the script(s) which are blocked, but does not provide any sort of reference to look up whether or not a given script is safe to run.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brinkman |first1=Martin |title=The Firefox NoScript guide you have all been waiting for |url= http://www.ghacks.net/2014/02/10/firefox-noscript-guide-waiting/ |website=GHacks.net |accessdate=14 January 2017 |date=February 10, 2014}}</ref> With complex webpages, users may be faced with well over a dozen different cryptic URLs and a non-functioning webpage, with only the choice to allow the script, block the script or to allow it temporarily.\n\nNoScript may provide additional defenses against web-based attacks such as [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]], [[Cross-site request forgery|CSRF]], [[clickjacking]], [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s, and [[DNS rebinding]], with specific countermeasures that work independently from script blocking.<ref name=\"al_9x\">{{cite web |url= https://hackademix.net/2010/08/01/al_9x-was-right-my-router-is-safe/ |title=al_9x Was Right, My Router is Safe |author=Giorgio Maone |date=2010-08-01 |publisher=Hackademix.net |accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref>\n\nOn November 14, 2017, Giorgio Maone announced NoScript 10, which will be \"very different\" from 5.x versions, and will use WebExtension technology, making it compatible with [[Firefox 57|Firefox Quantum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hackademix.net/2017/11/14/double-noscript/ |title=Double NoScript|author=Giorgio Maone |date=2017-11-14 |publisher=Hackademix.net |accessdate=2017-11-15}}</ref>. On November 20, 2017, Maone released version 10.1.1 for Firefox 57 and above.  NoScript is available for Firefox for Android and there is also preliminary work to port it to Chromium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/hackademix/noscript/pull/28|title=Cosmetic Changes by Issa1553 \u00b7 Pull Request #28 \u00b7 hackademix/noscript|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Site matching and whitelisting===\n[[File:NoScript Anywhere 3.5a15 site permissions in IceCatMobile 52.6 on Android 4.1.2.png|thumb|right|175px|NoScript Anywhere 3.5a15 site permissions in [[GNU IceCat|IceCat Mobile]] 52.6 on Android 4.1.2]]\nUnlike general ad-blocking extensions that rely on blacklists, NoScript relies on whitelisting through 'Allow' or 'Trust' commands in NoScript's toolbar pop-up. Sources of scripts and other active content are listed by domain name, less often by IP address. Domains that are not whitelisted, are blocked by default, save for a built-in pre-approved whitelist that can later be edited.\n\nOften, domain names that would offer active content, are not identical to the domain name shown in the address field of the displayed web page. This is because many web pages and web applications fetch elements such as [[HTML element#Frames|iframes]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], scripts, and embeddable objects from remote sites. When a web page includes scripts and other blockable elements from many sources, the user may specify a blocking policy for the main address and each of the domains separately.\n\nNo scripts are executed, if the address of the ''main page'' has been marked as untrusted. Once any source is marked as trusted, NoScript will regard it as 'trusted', even if it is loaded indirectly by web pages or scripts originating from other domains.\n\nThe names of certain domains often indicate the purpose of the scripts they might serve, for example, domains from online advertising and tracking firms. This gives users the ability to very specifically not to allow domains that they do want active content to run from.  This is a trial-and-error process. Upon allowing (trusting) the domain of a website, the entire web page is reloaded by default, and the process of having to allow further domains with necessary scripts must then be repeated, as additional domains that would offer active content, may be listed after allowing the previous domain.<ref>{{cite web |title=NoScript features |url=https://noscript.net/features |website=NoScript |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NoScript FAQ |url=https://noscript.net/faq |website=NoScript |accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe possibility to allow scripts coming from a certain source only for specific ''main page'' locations has been requested frequently, but is not yet easy to configure. It may be achieved in classic NoScript by configuring the built-in [[#Application Boundaries Enforcer (ABE)|ABE]] module to fine-tune cross-site resource access.<ref>[https://noscript.net/faq#qa8_10 Can I use ABE to fine-tune NoScript's permissions?] ''NoScript.net''. Retrieved November 27, 2010.</ref>\n\nFor each source, the exact address, exact domain, or parent domain may be specified. By enabling a domain (e.g. mozilla.org), all its subdomains are implicitly enabled (e.g. www.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org and so on) with every possible protocol (e.g. HTTP and https). By enabling an address (protocol://host, e.g. <nowiki>https://mozilla.org</nowiki>), its subdirectories are enabled (e.g. <nowiki>https://mozilla.org/firefox</nowiki> and <nowiki>https://mozilla.org/thunderbird</nowiki>), but not its domain ancestors nor its siblings.

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces. It has sometimes been sold as '''Standard''' or '''Basic Commercial''' in English-speaking countries.\n==Design characteristics==\n[[Image:Akzidenz-Grotesk variations.svg|thumb|Digital variants of Akzidenz-Grotesk, showing the slight inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies between different weights and widths]]\nLike most [[sans-serif]]s, Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, with all strokes of the letter of similar width.

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces.
