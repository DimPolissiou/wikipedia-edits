interests included [[skateboarding]], [[basketball]], [[chess tournaments]], and competitive [[strategy games]].<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Sports were his primary interest before he found competitive ''StarCraft''.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> His consuming interest in playing and studying the game interfered with his high school education, where he failed many of his classes.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> He graduated from [[Salem High School (New Hampshire)|Salem High School]] in 2002.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/>\n\n== StarCraft career ==\n\nStemkoski was 14 years old when he was introduced to ''[[StarCraft]]'' at his best friend's house, where he watched his friend play.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> He received a copy of the game for his 15th birthday and played it casually with friends.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> When bedridden with a broken ankle and metal implants after a trampoline accident, he began to play ''StarCraft'' competitively.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> While his friends lost interest, he continued to compete over the Internet.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Stemkoski has said that after his first year, he had spent about 1,200 hours in-game, up to 16 hours a day, and knew he could play in tournaments.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> As his ''StarCraft'' habits began to affect his life, his parents confiscated his [[dial-up modem]] and [[computer peripherals]], which he circumvented with replacements.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Despite his parents' requests to desist, Stemkoski decided in high school that he would pursue the game as a career based on the game's popularity in South Korea.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> At this time, he was ranked as within the top three American ''StarCraft'' players.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> He represented North America twice at the ''StarCraft'' World Championships, and competed in the United States finals eight times.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/>\n\nHe began a ''StarCraft'' tournament in New Hampshire, and was motivated to commentate on the matches by the dearth of English-speaking tournaments.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Stemkoski has said that he felt like the game's community deserved more professional commentary, and decided to do it himself.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> His broadcasts were recorded to a computer and uploaded on the Web.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Stemkoski was later approached by Korean broadcasting company International e-Sports Group (IEG) in 2008, and accepted their offer.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> He was the second Western ''StarCraft'' commentator, or [[Webcast|caster]],<ref name=\"Kotaku: English voice\"/> in South Korea, after [[Nick Plott]].<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/>\n\nIn Korea, Stemkoski shared a small apartment with 15 teenage pro gamers.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> As ''StarCraft II''{{'}}s launch neared, Stemkoski and another American commentator living in Seoul, [[Nick \"Tasteless\" Plott]], had individually amassed significant followings, and had the interest of commercial broadcast networks.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> The two began casting together and became known by a [[portmanteau]] of their nicknames, Tasteless and Artosis, as Tastosis.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Before this partnership, the two knew each other through their former competitive gaming careers, but became friends in Korea.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' attributed their success to their \"magic\" dynamic from complementary personalities, with Stemkoski encyclopedic and analytic, and Plott bold and sociable.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> In July 2013, ''Polygon'' reported Tastosis to be \"the most well-known ''StarCraft 2'' casting duo in the world\", both broadcasting for [[GOMTV Global StarCraft II League|GOMTV Global ''StarCraft II'' League]].<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Rich McCormick cited the pair in 2011 as examples of how the electronics sports profession is developing celebrities.<ref name=\"PC Gamer: why I love\"/> ''[[The Verge]]''{{'}}s Paul Miller referred to Tastosis as \"the primary practitioners of  ''StarCraft'' casting\".<ref name=\"The Verge: Miller changed my life\"/> A [[crowdfunded]] documentary about their careers, ''Sons of StarCraft'', was released in early 2013.<ref name=\"PCGamesN: SoS trailer\"/>\n\nStemkoski and Plott prepare separately, with Stemkoski constantly watching ''StarCraft'' matches and Plott studying commentary from non-traditional sports and major ''StarCraft'' news.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Together, they incorporate team histories and their respective strategies into their commentary.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/> Plott has said that he considers Tastosis's nuanced readings of player tactics and their eventualities as a \"gateway\" for bringing unfamiliar crowds into ''StarCraft''.<ref name=\"Polygon: became stars\"/>\n\nStemkoski cast alongside Plott at the [[2012 StarCraft II World Championship Series]] Europe finals,<ref name=\"WCS 2012 Europe\"/> Australian and Oceania finals,<ref name=\"Polygon: WCS 2012 Oceania\"/> and UK

Heart of the Swarm]]'' are named after the casters.<ref name=\"Kotaku: HotS Easter eggs\"/>\n\n== ''Hearthstone'' career ==\n\nArtosis began playing the [[Blizzard Entertainment]] online [[collectible card game]] ''[[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft]]'' during its closed beta in 2013, and began publishing ''Hearthstone'' podcasts in September 2013. In November 2013 Blizzard invited Stemkoski to participate in the Innkeeper's Invitational, a ''Hearthstone'' tournament hosted as part of the annual [[BlizzCon]] convention.<ref name=\"Escapist: Innkeeper's\"/> On November 8, Artosis won the tournament and was crowned \"Grandmaster of the Hearth\".<ref name=\"Hearthstone Innkeeper's Invitational 2013\"/>\n\nArtosis regularly is a caster for gaming tournaments that occasionally includes ''Hearthstone'' content, and was featured in the ESports Global Network's Fight Night Hearthstone shows, as part of Team Dogehouse and at the 2015 Seatstory Cup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esgntv.com/tv/show/detail.php?ctgr_no=22 |title=ESGN TV |accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref> He streams on Twitch and [[afreecaTV]].\n\n== Personal life

Previously, he had served as the Chief Judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Cardozo is remembered for his significant influence on the development of American [[common law]] in the 20th century, in addition to his philosophy and vivid prose style.\n\nBorn in [[New York City]], Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 after attending [[Columbia Law School]]. He won an election to the [[New York Supreme Court]] in 1913 but joined the [[New York Court of Appeals]] the following year. He won election as Chief Judge of that court in 1926. \n\nIn 1932, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court to succeed [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] Cardozo served on the Court until his death in 1938, and formed part of the liberal bloc of justices known as the [[Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|Three Musketeers]]. He wrote the Court's majority opinion in notable cases such as ''[[Nixon v. Condon]]'' and ''[[Steward Machine Co. v.

Their ancestors had immigrated to the British colonies from [[London]], [[England]] before the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThe family were descended from Jewish-origin [[New Christian]] [[conversos]]. They left the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for [[Holland]] during the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].<ref name=\"book12\"/> There they returned to the practice of [[Judaism]].

He was implicated in a judicial corruption scandal, sparked by the [[Erie Railway]] takeover wars, and forced to resign. The scandal also led to the creation of the [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]]. After leaving the court, the senior Cardozo practiced law for nearly two decades more until his death in 1885. \n\nWhen Benjamin and Emily were young, their mother Rebecca died. The twins were raised during much of their childhood largely by their sister Nell, who was 11 years older. Benjamin remained devoted to her throughout his life.

He took office on January 1, 1927, and resigned on March 7, 1932 to accept an appointment to the [[United States Supreme Court]].\n\nHis tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in [[tort]] and [[contract]] law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings.<ref name=\"supreme court\"/> \n\nIn 1921, Cardozo gave the Storrs Lectures at [[Yale University]], which were later published as ''[[The Nature of the Judicial Process]]'' ([http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/CARDOZO/CarNat.html On line version]), a book that remains valuable to judges today.<ref name=\"supreme court\"/> Shortly thereafter, Cardozo became a member of the group that founded the [[American Law Institute]], which crafted a [[Restatement of the Law]] of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world.<ref name=\"supreme court\"/>\n\nWhile on the Court of Appeals, he criticized the [[Exclusionary rule]] as developed by the federal courts, saying: \"The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.\"  He noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.<ref>''People of the State of New York v.

Previously, he had served as the Chief Judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Cardozo is remembered for his significant influence on the development of American [[common law]] in the 20th century, in addition to his philosophy and vivid prose style.\n\nBorn in [[New York City]], Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 after attending [[Columbia Law School]]. He won an election to the [[New York Supreme Court]] in 1913 but joined the [[New York Court of Appeals]] the following year. He won election as Chief Judge of that court in 1926. \n\nIn 1932, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court to succeed [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] Cardozo served on the Court until his death in 1938, and formed part of the liberal bloc of justices known as the [[Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|Three Musketeers]].

Their ancestors had immigrated to the British colonies from [[London]], [[England]] before the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThe family were descended from Jewish-origin [[New Christian]] [[conversos]]. They left the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for [[Holland]] during the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].<ref name=\"book12\"/> There they returned to the practice of [[Judaism]].

He was implicated in a judicial corruption scandal, sparked by the [[Erie Railway]] takeover wars, and forced to resign. The scandal also led to the creation of the [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]]. After leaving the court, the senior Cardozo practiced law for nearly two decades more until his death in 1885. \n\nWhen Benjamin and Emily were young, their mother Rebecca died. The twins were raised during much of their childhood largely by their sister Nell, who was 11 years older. Benjamin remained devoted to her throughout his life.

This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings.<ref name=\"supreme court\"/> \n\nIn 1921, Cardozo gave the Storrs Lectures at [[Yale University]], which were later published as ''[[The Nature of the Judicial Process]]'' ([http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/CARDOZO/CarNat.html On line version]), a book that remains valuable to judges today.<ref name=\"supreme court\"/> Shortly thereafter, Cardozo became a member of the group that founded the [[American Law Institute]], which crafted a [[Restatement of the Law]] of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects.

Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] strongly urged Hoover to name Cardozo, even offering to resign to make room for him if Hoover had his heart set on someone else (Stone had suggested to [[Calvin Coolidge]] that he should nominate Cardozo in 1925 before Stone).<ref>(Handler, 1995)</ref> Hoover originally demurred; he was concerned that there were already two justices from New York, and a Jew on the court. Justice [[James Clark McReynolds|James McReynolds]] was known as a notorious anti-Semite. When the chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], [[William Edgar Borah|William E. Borah]] of Idaho, added his strong support for Cardozo, however, Hoover finally bowed to the pressure.\n\nCardozo was a member of the [[Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|Three Musketeers]], along with Brandeis and Stone, who were considered to be the liberal faction of the Supreme Court. In his years as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]], Cardozo wrote opinions that stressed the necessity for the tightest adherence to the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].\n\n==Death==\nIn late 1937, Cardozo had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and in early 1938, he suffered a [[stroke]].

It was officially known as '''Hong Kong International Airport''' from 1954 to 6 July 1998, when it was closed and replaced by a new and larger one at [[Chek Lap Kok]], {{convert|30|km|mi}} to the west.<ref name=\"CAD_1\" /> It is often known as '''Hong Kong International Airport, Kai Tak''',<ref>[http://www.dcfever.com/media/blog/files/118/118079/2015/09/118079_1442533258518.jpg Photo of Kai Tak Airport, shown the official name of the airport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918074546/http://www.dcfever.com/travel/article.php?id=3504 |date=18 September 2015 }}</ref> or simply '''Kai Tak''' and '''Kai Tak Airport''', to distinguish it from its successor which is often referred to as [[Hong Kong International Airport|Chek Lap Kok International Airport]].\n\nBecause of the geography of the area positioning the airport with water on all sides of the runway, with Kowloon City's residential apartment complexes and 2000+ft mountains to the north-east of the airport, aircraft could not fly over the mountains and quickly drop in for a final. Instead, aircraft had to fly above Victoria Harbour and Kowloon City, passing north of [[Mong Kok]]'s Bishop Hill. After passing Bishop Hill, pilots would see Chequerboard Hill with a large red and white chequerboard pattern. Once the pattern was sighted and identified, aircraft made a low-altitude (sub-600&nbsp;ft) 47\u00b0 right-hand turn, ending with a short final and touchdown. For pilots, this airport was technically demanding, as the approach could not be flown by aircraft instruments, but rather visually because of the right-hand turn required.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Hiufu|title=Breathtaking photos of Hong Kong airport glory days|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/11/travel/hong-kong-kai-tak-airport/|accessdate=12 June 2013|publisher=CNN|date=12 June 2013}}</ref> [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] program ''Most Extreme Airports'' ranked it as the 6th most dangerous airport in the world.<ref>''Most Extreme Airports''; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]; 26 August 2010</ref>\n\nThe airport was home to Hong Kong's international carrier [[Cathay Pacific]], as well as regional carrier Dragonair (now known as [[Cathay Dragon]]), freight airline [[Air Hong Kong]] and [[Hong Kong Airways]]. The airport was also home to the former [[RAF Kai Tak]].\n\n==Geographic environment==\n[[File:Kai-tak-1.jpg|thumb|The airport was surrounded by high-rise buildings. The airport car park is at the centre, and offices are on the right of the photograph.]]\n\nKai Tak was located on the east side of [[Kowloon Bay]] in [[Kowloon]], Hong Kong. The area is surrounded by rugged mountains. Less than {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} to the north and northeast of the former runway 13 threshold is a range of hills reaching an elevation of {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. To the east of the former 31 threshold, the hills are less than {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} away. Immediately to the south of the airport is [[Victoria Harbour]], and farther south is Hong Kong Island with hills up to {{convert|2100|ft|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen Kai Tak closed, there was only one runway in use, numbered 13/31 and oriented southeast\u2013northwest (134/314 degrees true, 136/316 degrees magnetic). The runway was made by reclaiming land from the harbour and was extended several times after its initial construction. The runway was {{convert|3390|m|abbr=on}} long when the airport closed.\n\nAt the northern end of the runway, buildings rose up to six stories just across a major multi-lane arterial road. The other three sides of the runway were surrounded by Victoria Harbour. The low-altitude turning manoeuvre before the shortened final approach was so close to these buildings that passengers could spot television sets in the apartments: \"...as the plane banked sharply to the right for landing ... the people watching television in the nearby apartments seemed an unsettling arms length away.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Randy Harris|title=The Year 2017: A Look at What's Coming in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybYAQO0ug3wC&pg=PA25|year=1999|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-58348-137-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hk1946-kai-tak.jpg|thumb|RAF [[Short Sunderland]]s and a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] at Kai Tak Airport, c. 1946]]\n\n===1925 to 1930s===\nThe story of Kai Tak started in 1912 when two businessmen [[Ho Kai]] and [[Au Tak]] formed the Kai Tak Investment Company to reclaim land in Kowloon for development.<ref>[http://www.batgung.com/kai-tak-airport-history Kai Tak Airport History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531041251/http://www.batgung.com/kai-tak-airport-history |date=31 May 2009 }}, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/teedeez/parker.html&date=2009-10-25+22:40:37 Hong Kong ATC history], [http://munsang.edu.hk/secondary/info/history/history.php Munsang College history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613204855/http://munsang.edu.hk/secondary/info/history/history.php |date=13 June 2008 }}</ref> The land was acquired by the government for use as an [[Aerodrome|airfield]] after the business plan failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blogthetalk.com/2005/07/memories-and-origins-of-kai-tak.html |title=Excerpt on Sir Kai Ho Kai |publisher=Blogthetalk.com |accessdate=2013-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830214225/http://www.blogthetalk.com/2005/07/memories-and-origins-of-kai-tak.html |archivedate=30 August 2012  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Harry Abbott opened The Abbott School of Aviation on that piece of land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hkaviationclub.com.hk/nav16.html |title=Hong Kong Aviation club Kai Tak History |publisher=Hkaviationclub.com.hk |accessdate=2013-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401004415/http://www.hkaviationclub.com.hk/nav16.html |archivedate=1 April 2013  }}</ref> Soon, it became a small grass strip runway airport for the [[RAF]] and several [[flying club]]s which, over time, grew to include the Hong Kong Flying Club, the Far East Flying Training School, and the Aero Club of Hong Kong, which exist today as an amalgamation known as the [[Hong Kong Aviation Club]].

Its usage was close to, and for some time exceeded, the designed capacity. The airport was designed to handle 24 million passengers per year, but in 1996, Kai Tak handled 29.5 million passengers, plus 1.56 million tonnes of freight, making it the third busiest airport in the world in terms of international passenger traffic, and busiest in terms of international cargo throughput.<ref name=\"CAD_1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cad.gov.hk/english/kaitak.html |title=Kai Tak Airport 1925\u20131998|publisher=Civil Aviation Department, Government of Hong Kong |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> Moreover, clearance requirements for aircraft takeoffs and landings made it necessary to limit the height of buildings that could be built in [[Kowloon]]. While Kai Tak was initially located far away from residential areas, the expansion of both residential areas and the airport resulted in Kai Tak being close to residential areas. This caused serious noise pollution for nearby residents and put height restrictions, which were removed after Kai Tak closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cad.gov.hk/english/ac_noise.html#comparison |title=Aircraft Noise: Comparison Between Kai Tak and the new Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA)|publisher=Civil Aviation Department, Government of Hong Kong |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> A night [[curfew]] from 11:30 pm to 6:30 am in the early morning also hindered operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr94-95/english/lc_sitg/hansard/h950419.pdf |title=Official Record of Proceedings, Wednesday, 19 April 1995 |publisher=Hong Kong Legislative Council |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>\n[[File:Kowloon Tsai, Hong Kong - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|thumb|Kowloon city, 1998. Prince Edward Road is the flyover in the photo]]\nAs a result, in the late 1980s, the [[Hong Kong Government]] began searching for alternative locations for a new airport in Hong Kong to replace the aging airport. After deliberating on a number of locations, including the south side of [[Hong Kong Island]], the government decided to build the airport on the island of [[Chek Lap Kok]] off [[Lantau Island]]. The new airport is located far away from Hong Kong's main residential areas, conduce to minimise the dangers of a major crash and also reducing the nuisance of noise pollution.<ref name=\"regen\"/> A huge number of resources were mobilised to build this new airport, part of the ten programmes in Hong Kong's [[Airport Core Programme]].\n\nThe Regal Meridien Hong Kong Airport Hotel, linked to the passenger terminal by a footbridge spanning Prince Edward Road, opened on 19 July 1982. This was Hong Kong's first airport hotel, and comprised 380 rooms including 47 suites.<ref name=\"firsthotel\">{{cite news|title=HK's first airport hotel opens|work=South China Morning Post|date=13 August 1982}}</ref> As of 2018 the hotel still exists, but the footbridge has been demolished. It is one of the few remaining buildings related to Kai Tak Airport.\n\n===Closure and legacy of Kai Tak Airport===\nThe new airport officially opened on 6 July 1998 to replace the functions of the Kai Tak Airport. All of the essential airport supplies and vehicles that were left in the old airport for operation (some of the non-essential ones had already been transported to the new airport) were transported to Chek Lap Kok in one early morning with a single massive move, with a police escort.\n\nOn 6 July 1998 at 01:28, after the last aircraft departed for Chek Lap Kok, Kai Tak was finally retired as an airport. The final flights were:\n\n* The last arrival: [[Cathay Dragon|Dragonair]] KA841 from [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport]] ([[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]]) landed Runway 13 at 23:38.\n* The last scheduled commercial flight: Cathay Pacific CX251 to [[Heathrow Airport]] ([[Boeing 747-400]]) took off from Runway 13 at 00:02.\n* The last departure: Cathay Pacific CX3340 ferry flight to the new [[Hong Kong International Airport]] ([[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300]]) took off from Runway 13 at 01:05.\n\nA small ceremony celebrating the end of the airport was held inside the control tower after the last flight took off. Richard Siegel, then-[[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|director of civil aviation]], gave a brief speech ending with the words \"Goodbye Kai Tak, and Thank you.\", before dimming the lights briefly and then turning them off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/11/travel/hong-kong-kai-tak-airport/|title=Breathtaking photos of Hong Kong airport glory days|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2013-12-13|date=12 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=AP Archive|title=Hong Kong - Kai Tak airport closes|date=2015-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9XdT9_Xp8Q|accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n\nAfter the last plane, a [[Cathay Pacific]] [[A340-300]], took off from Kai Tak International Airport to the new Hong Kong International Airport at 01:28 HKT, Kai Tak was closed, transferring its ICAO and IATA airport codes to the replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok.\n\nGovernment reports later revealed that Chek Lap Kok airport was not completely ready to be opened to the public despite trial runs held. Water supply and sewers were not installed completely. Telephones were installed, but the lines were not connected. The baggage system did not undergo extensive troubleshooting and passenger baggage as well as cargo, much of which was perishable, were lost. The government decided to temporarily reactivate Kai Tak's [[cargo terminal]] to minimise the damage caused by a [[software bug]] in the new airport's cargo handling system. During this period, the airport was given temporary ICAO code VHHX.\n\nThe passenger terminal later housed government offices, automobile dealerships and showrooms, a [[go-kart]] racecourse, a bowling alley, a [[snooker]] hall, a golf range and other recreational facilities. In the mid 2000s, the passenger terminal and hangars were demolished. Many aviation enthusiasts were upset at the demise of Kai Tak because of the unique runway 13 approach. As private aviation was no longer allowed at Chek Lap Kok (having moved to [[Sek Kong Airfield]]), some enthusiasts had lobbied to keep about {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} of the Kai Tak runway for [[general aviation]], but the suggestion was rejected as the Government had planned to build a new [[Kai Tak Cruise Terminal|cruise terminal at Kai Tak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pland.gov.hk/p_study/prog_s/sek_09/website_chib5_eng/english/Stage2_PP_Report_Eng.pdf |title=Kai Tak Planning Review \u2013 Report of Stage 2 Public Participation: Outline Zone Plans |publisher=Planning Department, the Government of HKSAR |accessdate=2007-04-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309161043/http://www.pland.gov.hk/p_study/prog_s/sek_09/website_chib5_eng/english/Stage2_PP_Report_Eng.pdf |archivedate= 9 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Hong Kong stop of [[Celine Dion]]'s [[Let's Talk About Love World Tour]] was held on the airport's runway on 25 January 1999.\n\nUntil its retirement in 2018, the name Kai Tak was one of the names used in the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#Western North Pacific (International Date Line to 100\u00b0E)|lists of tropical cyclone names in the northwest Pacific Ocean]].

Unfortunately, there is no approach chart available, so the entire approach procedure will have to be described without the chart.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe approach initially begins to the south-west of the airport, heading 270 at a minimum altitude of 6000&nbsp;ft. At this beginning stage of the approach, the aircraft should be passing above [[Cheung Chau]] - a small island just off [[Lantau Island]]. After that, the aircraft was required to proceed up to \"Point Golf\", which was on the south side of Lantau Island and directly south of the current Chek Lap Kok Airport. Approaching aircraft then had to make a right-hand U-turn in order to intercept the localiser for the Runway 13 IGS, which generally happened above the current Chek Lap Kok Airport site. The IGS was, in essence, a heavily modified ILS system designed uniquely for Kai Tak Airport, otherwise functioning identical to a normal ILS. At roughly ~2500&nbsp;ft, the autopilot was disconnected, and the rest of the approach was flown manually. The aircraft then descended below 1000&nbsp;ft and shortly afterwards reached [[Kowloon Tsai Park]] and its small hill. Upon reaching the small hill above Kowloon Tsai Park, which was painted with a large \"aviation orange\" and white checkerboard <sup>({{Coord|22|20|06|N|114|11|04|E|display=inline|name=Checkerboard Hill}})</sup>, used as a visual reference point on the final approach (in addition to the middle marker on the Instrument Guidance System), the pilot needed to make a 47\u00b0 visual right turn to line up with the runway and complete the final leg. The aircraft would be just {{convert|2|nmi|km|lk = in}} from touchdown, at a height of less than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} when the turn was made. Typically the plane would enter the final right turn at a height of about {{convert|650|ft|m}} and exit it at a height of {{convert|140|ft|m}} to line up with the runway. That demanding manoeuvre became known in the aviation community as the \"Hong Kong Turn\" or the \"Checkerboard Turn\". For many airline passengers on planes approaching and landing on Runway 13 at Kai Tak Airport, it became referred to as the \"Kai Tak Heart Attack\", because they were often frightened to be turning at such a close proximity to the ground, which, at less than 150&nbsp;ft, or 45 metres, was generally less than even the [[Boeing 767]]'s wingspan, which is considered a medium-size airliner. The turn was so low that passengers could see television sets running in people's residences near the airport.<ref>{{cite book|title=Exploring Hong Kong: A Visitor's Guide to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories|author=Steven K. Bailey|page=136|publisher=ThingsAsian Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1934159163}}</ref>\n\nHandling the runway 13 approach was difficult enough with normal crosswinds because, even if the wind direction was constant, it was changing relative to the aircraft as the plane made the 47\u00b0 visual right turn, meaning that what would be a headwind heading directly east on the IGS would become a crosswind and begin to push the aircraft over and off the runway alignment without correction. The landing would become even more challenging when crosswinds from the north-east were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range north-east of the airport also made the wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. Watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big [[crosswind landing|crab angles]] during their final approaches was popular with [[plane spotter]]s. Despite the difficulty, the runway 13 approach was used most of the time due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong.\n\nBecause of the turn required during final approach, [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] was not available for runway 13 and landings had to follow a visual approach. This made the approach unusable in low visibility conditions.\n\n===Runway 13 departure===\nRunway 13 was the preferred departure runway for heavy aircraft due to the clear departure path, opposite that of the runway 31 departure. Heavy aircraft on departure using runway 13 would commonly{{explain|date=June 2019}} be observed{{by whom|date=June 2019}} using nearly the entire length of the runway, particularly during summer days due to the air temperature.\n\n===Runway 31 approach===\nRunway 31 approaches and landings were similar to other airports in which ILS was available. Runways 13 and 31 are, in fact, the same physical runway, however if a flight is landing on Runway 13 that means that the aircraft is flying in on a south-easterly direction, while a flight landing on Runway 31 would be coming in a north-westerly direction. This applies for flights taking off on runways 13 and 31 - a flight departing from runway 13 would be heading south-east, and vice versa. This is because runways are named for their magnetic heading in decadegrees, which means that a runway oriented anywhere between 125\u00b0 and 134\u00b0 magnetic would be numbered 13, and vice versa. The path towards the runway passed within 300 metres to the north of [[Heng Fa Chuen]] on [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\n===Runway 31 departure===\nWhen lined up for takeoff on runway 31, a range of hills including {{convert|1500|ft|m}} [[Beacon Hill, Hong Kong|Beacon Hill]] would be right in front of the aircraft. The aircraft had to make a sharp 65-degree left turn soon after takeoff to avoid the hills (i.e. the reverse of a Runway 13 landing). If a runway change occurred due to wind change from runway 13 departures to runway 31 departures, planes that were loaded to maximum payload for runway 13 departures had to return to the terminal to offload some goods to provide enough climbing clearance over buildings during a runway 31 departure.\n\n===Private aviation===\n[[File:HK Aviation Club kaiTak01.JPG|thumb|[[Hong Kong Aviation Club]] building at the former Kai Tak Airport, with the headquarters of the [[Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps]]]]\nThe [[Hong Kong Aviation Club]] formerly held most of its activities at Kai Tak,<ref name=TakesoffforSekKong>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/85610/aviation-club-takes-sek-kong|title=Aviation club takes off for Sek Kong|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=1994-08-22|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> where it had hangars and other facilities.<ref name=Wordiep242>{{cite book|last=Wordie|first=Jason|title=Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyfPeYnp3-oC&pg=PA242|year=2002|isbn=978-9-62-209563-2|page=242}}</ref>\n\nThe club moved most of its aircraft to [[Shek Kong Airfield]] in 1994 after the hours for general aviation at Kai Tak were sharply reduced, to two hours per morning, as of 1 July that year.<ref name=TakesoffforSekKong/> Kai Tak closed to fixed-wing traffic in 1998.<ref name=Wordiep242/> The club ended its helicopter activities at Kai Tak on 9 July 2017.<ref>\"[http://aviationclub.hk/doc/English.pdf Hong Kong Aviation Club responds to media enquiries].\" Hong Kong Aviation Club. 27 May 2017.

Instead, aircraft had to fly above Victoria Harbour and Kowloon City, passing north of [[Mong Kok]]'s Bishop Hill. After passing Bishop Hill, pilots would see Chequerboard Hill with a large red and white chequerboard pattern.

For pilots, this airport was technically demanding, as the approach could not be flown by aircraft instruments, but rather visually because of the right-hand turn required.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Hiufu|title=Breathtaking photos of Hong Kong airport glory days|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/11/travel/hong-kong-kai-tak-airport/|accessdate=12 June 2013|publisher=CNN|date=12 June 2013}}</ref> [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] program ''Most Extreme Airports'' ranked it as the 6th most dangerous airport in the world.<ref>''Most Extreme Airports''; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]; 26 August 2010</ref>\n\nThe airport was home to Hong Kong's international carrier [[Cathay Pacific]], as well as regional carrier Dragonair (now known as [[Cathay Dragon]]), freight airline [[Air Hong Kong]] and [[Hong Kong Airways]].

Its usage was close to, and for some time exceeded, the designed capacity. The airport was designed to handle 24 million passengers per year, but in 1996, Kai Tak handled 29.5 million passengers, plus 1.56 million tonnes of freight, making it the third busiest airport in the world in terms of international passenger traffic, and busiest in terms of international cargo throughput.<ref name=\"CAD_1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cad.gov.hk/english/kaitak.html |title=Kai Tak Airport 1925\u20131998|publisher=Civil Aviation Department, Government of Hong Kong |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> Moreover, clearance requirements for aircraft takeoffs and landings made it necessary to limit the height of buildings that could be built in [[Kowloon]]. While Kai Tak was initially located far away from residential areas, the expansion of both residential areas and the airport resulted in Kai Tak being close to residential areas. This caused serious noise pollution for nearby residents and put height restrictions, which were removed after Kai Tak closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cad.gov.hk/english/ac_noise.html#comparison |title=Aircraft Noise: Comparison Between Kai Tak and the new Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA)|publisher=Civil Aviation Department, Government of Hong Kong |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> A night [[curfew]] from 11:30 pm to 6:30 am in the early morning also hindered operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr94-95/english/lc_sitg/hansard/h950419.pdf |title=Official Record of Proceedings, Wednesday, 19 April 1995 |publisher=Hong Kong Legislative Council |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>\n[[File:Kowloon Tsai, Hong Kong - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|thumb|Kowloon city, 1998. Prince Edward Road is the flyover in the photo]]\nAs a result, in the late 1980s, the [[Hong Kong Government]] began searching for alternative locations for a new airport in Hong Kong to replace the aging airport. After deliberating on a number of locations, including the south side of [[Hong Kong Island]], the government decided to build the airport on the island of [[Chek Lap Kok]] off [[Lantau Island]]. The new airport is located far away from Hong Kong's main residential areas, conduce to minimise the dangers of a major crash and also reducing the nuisance of noise pollution.<ref name=\"regen\"/> A huge number of resources were mobilised to build this new airport, part of the ten programmes in Hong Kong's [[Airport Core Programme]].\n\nThe Regal Meridien Hong Kong Airport Hotel, linked to the passenger terminal by a footbridge spanning Prince Edward Road, opened on 19 July 1982. This was Hong Kong's first airport hotel, and comprised 380 rooms including 47 suites.<ref name=\"firsthotel\">{{cite news|title=HK's first airport hotel opens|work=South China Morning Post|date=13 August 1982}}</ref> As of 2018 the hotel still exists, but the footbridge has been demolished. It is one of the few remaining buildings related to Kai Tak Airport.\n\n===Closure and legacy of Kai Tak Airport===\nThe new airport officially opened on 6 July 1998 to replace the functions of the Kai Tak Airport. All of the essential airport supplies and vehicles that were left in the old airport for operation (some of the non-essential ones had already been transported to the new airport) were transported to Chek Lap Kok in one early morning with a single massive move, with a police escort.\n\nOn 6 July 1998 at 01:28, after the last aircraft departed for Chek Lap Kok, Kai Tak was finally retired as an airport. The final flights were:\n\n* The last arrival: [[Cathay Dragon|Dragonair]] KA841 from [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport]] ([[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]]) landed Runway 13 at 23:38.\n* The last scheduled commercial flight: Cathay Pacific CX251 to [[Heathrow Airport]] ([[Boeing 747-400]]) took off from Runway 13 at 00:02.\n* The last departure: Cathay Pacific CX3340 ferry flight to the new [[Hong Kong International Airport]] ([[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300]]) took off from Runway 13 at 01:05.\n\nA small ceremony celebrating the end of the airport was held inside the control tower after the last flight took off. Richard Siegel, then-[[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|director of civil aviation]], gave a brief speech ending with the words \"Goodbye Kai Tak, and Thank you.\", before dimming the lights briefly and then turning them off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/11/travel/hong-kong-kai-tak-airport/|title=Breathtaking photos of Hong Kong airport glory days|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2013-12-13|date=12 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=AP Archive|title=Hong Kong - Kai Tak airport closes|date=2015-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9XdT9_Xp8Q|accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n\nAfter the last plane, a [[Cathay Pacific]] [[A340-300]], took off from Kai Tak International Airport to the new Hong Kong International Airport at 01:28 HKT, Kai Tak was closed, transferring its ICAO and IATA airport codes to the replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok.\n\nGovernment reports later revealed that Chek Lap Kok airport was not completely ready to be opened to the public despite trial runs held. Water supply and sewers were not installed completely. Telephones were installed, but the lines were not connected. The baggage system did not undergo extensive troubleshooting and passenger baggage as well as cargo, much of which was perishable, were lost. The government decided to temporarily reactivate Kai Tak's [[cargo terminal]] to minimise the damage caused by a [[software bug]] in the new airport's cargo handling system. During this period, the airport was given temporary ICAO code VHHX.\n\nThe passenger terminal later housed government offices, automobile dealerships and showrooms, a [[go-kart]] racecourse, a bowling alley, a [[snooker]] hall, a golf range and other recreational facilities. In the mid 2000s, the passenger terminal and hangars were demolished. Many aviation enthusiasts were upset at the demise of Kai Tak because of the unique runway 13 approach. As private aviation was no longer allowed at Chek Lap Kok (having moved to [[Sek Kong Airfield]]), some enthusiasts had lobbied to keep about {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} of the Kai Tak runway for [[general aviation]], but the suggestion was rejected as the Government had planned to build a new [[Kai Tak Cruise Terminal|cruise terminal at Kai Tak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pland.gov.hk/p_study/prog_s/sek_09/website_chib5_eng/english/Stage2_PP_Report_Eng.pdf |title=Kai Tak Planning Review \u2013 Report of Stage 2 Public Participation: Outline Zone Plans |publisher=Planning Department, the Government of HKSAR |accessdate=2007-04-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309161043/http://www.pland.gov.hk/p_study/prog_s/sek_09/website_chib5_eng/english/Stage2_PP_Report_Eng.pdf |archivedate= 9 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Hong Kong stop of [[Celine Dion]]'s [[Let's Talk About Love World Tour]] was held on the airport's runway on 25 January 1999.\n\nUntil its retirement in 2018, the name Kai Tak was one of the names used in the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#Western North Pacific (International Date Line to 100\u00b0E)|lists of tropical cyclone names in the northwest Pacific Ocean]].

Unfortunately, there is no approach chart available, so the entire approach procedure will have to be described without the chart.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe approach initially begins to the south-west of the airport, heading 270 at a minimum altitude of 6000&nbsp;ft. At this beginning stage of the approach, the aircraft should be passing above [[Cheung Chau]] - a small island just off [[Lantau Island]]. After that, the aircraft was required to proceed up to \"Point Golf\", which was on the south side of Lantau Island and directly south of the current Chek Lap Kok Airport. Approaching aircraft then had to make a right-hand U-turn in order to intercept the localiser for the Runway 13 IGS, which generally happened above the current Chek Lap Kok Airport site. The IGS was, in essence, a heavily modified ILS system designed uniquely for Kai Tak Airport, otherwise functioning identical to a normal ILS. At roughly ~2500&nbsp;ft, the autopilot was disconnected, and the rest of the approach was flown manually. The aircraft then descended below 1000&nbsp;ft and shortly afterwards reached [[Kowloon Tsai Park]] and its small hill. Upon reaching the small hill above Kowloon Tsai Park, which was painted with a large \"aviation orange\" and white checkerboard <sup>({{Coord|22|20|06|N|114|11|04|E|display=inline|name=Checkerboard Hill}})</sup>, used as a visual reference point on the final approach (in addition to the middle marker on the Instrument Guidance System), the pilot needed to make a 47\u00b0 visual right turn to line up with the runway and complete the final leg. The aircraft would be just {{convert|2|nmi|km|lk = in}} from touchdown, at a height of less than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} when the turn was made. Typically the plane would enter the final right turn at a height of about {{convert|650|ft|m}} and exit it at a height of {{convert|140|ft|m}} to line up with the runway. That demanding manoeuvre became known in the aviation community as the \"Hong Kong Turn\" or the \"Checkerboard Turn\". For many airline passengers on planes approaching and landing on Runway 13 at Kai Tak Airport, it became referred to as the \"Kai Tak Heart Attack\", because they were often frightened to be turning at such a close proximity to the ground, which, at less than 150&nbsp;ft, or 45 metres, was generally less than even the [[Boeing 767]]'s wingspan, which is considered a medium-size airliner. The turn was so low that passengers could see television sets running in people's residences near the airport.<ref>{{cite book|title=Exploring Hong Kong: A Visitor's Guide to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories|author=Steven K. Bailey|page=136|publisher=ThingsAsian Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1934159163}}</ref>\n\nHandling the runway 13 approach was difficult enough with normal crosswinds because, even if the wind direction was constant, it was changing relative to the aircraft as the plane made the 47\u00b0 visual right turn, meaning that what would be a headwind heading directly east on the IGS would become a crosswind and begin to push the aircraft over and off the runway alignment without correction. The landing would become even more challenging when crosswinds from the north-east were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range north-east of the airport also made the wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. Watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big [[crosswind landing|crab angles]] during their final approaches was popular with [[plane spotter]]s. Despite the difficulty, the runway 13 approach was used most of the time due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong.\n\nBecause of the turn required during final approach, [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] was not available for runway 13 and landings had to follow a visual approach. This made the approach unusable in low visibility conditions.\n\n===Runway 13 departure===\nRunway 13 was the preferred departure runway for heavy aircraft due to the clear departure path, opposite that of the runway 31 departure. Heavy aircraft on departure using runway 13 would commonly{{explain|date=June 2019}} be observed{{by whom|date=June 2019}} using nearly the entire length of the runway, particularly during summer days due to the air temperature.\n\n===Runway 31 approach===\nRunway 31 approaches and landings were similar to other airports in which ILS was available. Runways 13 and 31 are, in fact, the same physical runway, however if a flight is landing on Runway 13 that means that the aircraft is flying in on a south-easterly direction, while a flight landing on Runway 31 would be coming in a north-westerly direction. This applies for flights taking off on runways 13 and 31 - a flight departing from runway 13 would be heading south-east, and vice versa. This is because runways are named for their magnetic heading in decadegrees, which means that a runway oriented anywhere between 125\u00b0 and 134\u00b0 magnetic would be numbered 13, and vice versa. The path towards the runway passed within 300 metres to the north of [[Heng Fa Chuen]] on [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\n===Runway 31 departure===\nWhen lined up for takeoff on runway 31, a range of hills including {{convert|1500|ft|m}} [[Beacon Hill, Hong Kong|Beacon Hill]] would be right in front of the aircraft. The aircraft had to make a sharp 65-degree left turn soon after takeoff to avoid the hills (i.e. the reverse of a Runway 13 landing). If a runway change occurred due to wind change from runway 13 departures to runway 31 departures, planes that were loaded to maximum payload for runway 13 departures had to return to the terminal to offload some goods to provide enough climbing clearance over buildings during a runway 31 departure.\n\n===Private aviation===\n[[File:HK Aviation Club kaiTak01.JPG|thumb|[[Hong Kong Aviation Club]] building at the former Kai Tak Airport, with the headquarters of the [[Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps]]]]\nThe [[Hong Kong Aviation Club]] formerly held most of its activities at Kai Tak,<ref name=TakesoffforSekKong>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/85610/aviation-club-takes-sek-kong|title=Aviation club takes off for Sek Kong|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=1994-08-22|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> where it had hangars and other facilities.<ref name=Wordiep242>{{cite book|last=Wordie|first=Jason|title=Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyfPeYnp3-oC&pg=PA242|year=2002|isbn=978-9-62-209563-2|page=242}}</ref>\n\nThe club moved most of its aircraft to [[Shek Kong Airfield]] in 1994 after the hours for general aviation at Kai Tak were sharply reduced, to two hours per morning, as of 1 July that year.<ref name=TakesoffforSekKong/> Kai Tak closed to fixed-wing traffic in 1998.<ref name=Wordiep242/> The club ended its helicopter activities at Kai Tak on 9 July 2017.<ref>\"[http://aviationclub.hk/doc/English.pdf Hong Kong Aviation Club responds to media enquiries].\" Hong Kong Aviation Club. 27 May 2017.

It is headquartered in Melbourne. It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership. Unsecured creditors were owed $93 million, and the company was $50 million in debt.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/former-harris-scarfe-executive-jailed-six-years-20020627-gduc7w.html|title=Former Harris Scarfe executive jailed six years|date=27 June 2002|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 December 2019|url-status=live|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}</ref> In June 2002, the company's former chief financial officer, Alan Hodgson, was sentenced to six years in jail, on multiple counts that included giving false information to the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], and failing to act honestly as a company officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Harris Scarfe listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (ASX). In the same year, the company fell $160 million into debt, resulting in the owners, the Trescowthick family, losing $31.5 million. The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth. By 2007, Sydney-based Momentum Private Equity acquired an $80&nbsp;million majority stake in the company. During 2012, Momentum Corporate ten sold the business to [[Pepkor]], a South African private equity firm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOver a six-month period at the end of 2003, Harris Scarfe made certain representations on a number of items in its catalogues in relation to pricing. Harris Scarfe admitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that representations in its promotional advertising may have misled consumers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/harris-scarfe-admits-sale-prices-may-have-misled-issues-public-apology|title=Harris Scarfe admits sale prices may have misled, issues public apology|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-02-23|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nAgain in 2007 Harris Scarfe was investigated by the Australian consumer watchdog who sued the department store in the Australian Federal Court over allegedly false promotions for its sales in October 2006. The ACCC alleged that the advertising was misleading because Harris Scarfe was not offering what it advertised:\n\n# A discount off all goods in its stores.\n# A minimum of 20% off all goods in its stores.\n\nThe ACCC also alleged that the catalogue included images of products under banners stating a specific discount when some of those goods were not discounted by the stated percentage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartcompany.com.au/marketing/advertising/accc-challenges-harris-scarfe-ads/|title=ACCC challenges Harris Scarfe ads|date=2007-10-12|website=SmartCompany|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Federal Court, Adelaide has declared that Harris Scarfe Australia Pty Ltd misled consumers by representing in a catalogue that certain advertised items were discounted by a specific amount when in fact they were discounted by less than that amount, or were not discounted at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/court-declares-harris-scarfe-misled-consumers|title=Court declares Harris Scarfe misled consumers|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-02-23|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe CEO Robert Atkins, resigned from the top post at Harris Scarfe in March 2009 after eight years leading the turnaround of department store.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/exharris-scarfe-boss-robert-atkins-dies-20100115-mb6b.html|title=Ex-Harris Scarfe boss Robert Atkins dies|date=2010-01-15|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> He played a significant role in the restructuring of retail trading hours in South Australia and in the revitalisation of the state\u2019s premium retail precinct as chairman of the Rundle Mall Management Authority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retailbiz.com.au/offline-retailing/former-harris-scarfe-ceo-robert-atkins-dies/|title=Former Harris Scarfe CEO Robert Atkins dies|last=retailbizc0rD8|date=2010-01-15|website=retailbiz|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Robert Atkins passed away in January 2010. \n\nAfter Robert Atkins successful tenure leading Harris Scarfe, Joe Barberis was named managing director of the retailer in February 2009 until September 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://au.linkedin.com/in/joe-barberis-b3a2b96|title=Joe Barberis LinkedIn|last=Barberis|first=Joe|date=11/4/2020|website=LinkedIn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Graham Dean, previously Myer group general manager of Electrical was named CEO of Harris Scarfe. \n\nIn 2012, Kyly Clarke became the face of Harris Scarfe's fashion home brand 'Boutique@hs'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsugar.com.au/fashion/Kyly-Clarke-Face-New-Harris-Scarfe-Fashion-Label-Boutiquehs-25432051|title=Kyly Clarke Is The Face Of New Label Boutique@hs!|last=Rota|first=Genevieve|date=2012-10-14|website=POPSUGAR Fashion Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, Greenlit Brands, formerly [[Steinhoff International|Steinhoff Asia Pacific]], acquired [[Pepkor]] and this included Harris Scarfe.

It is headquartered in Melbourne. It has a growing e-commerce retail presence in Australia and is considered a multi-channel department store retailer.\n\nFounded in 1849, Harris Scarfe currently operates 66 retail stores nationally in two formats including \"Harris Scarfe\" [[department stores]] and \"Harris Scarfe Home\" homewares and kitchenware stores.\n\nIn December 2019, Harris Scarfe entered into voluntary administration after 170 years in operation. {{as of|2020|1}}, 21 of its 65 stores are set to close.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nHarris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on the ship, \"Candahar\", to establish a hardware and [[ironmonger]]y business. Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 and the business name \"Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe & Co.\" was adopted in December that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207681585 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Express]] |volume=IV |issue=914 |location=South Australia |date=17 December 1866 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items.  Besides conducting its retailing businesses, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage, as part of a wholesaling operation. Notably, during [[World War II]], when the [[Australian Government]] enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.\n\n===1970s - 1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited (\"IMFC\") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which was listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] at the time.\n\n[[Charles Davis Limited]], a listed [[Tasmania]]n company controlled by [[Sir Donald Trescowthick]], acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976. Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business, developing a full line department store model, while the industrial products outlet at [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business.\n\nThe success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, [[Campbell's]] in Queensland, and [[Bunnings Warehouse|McEwans]] in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by [[Bunnings]] in 1993.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, Harris Scarfe entered an era of unprecedented national growth. It expanded beyond its large department store in Rundle Mall into smaller format suburban and regional shopping stores. Harris Scarfe also acquired full-line department store sites from other retailers who were rationalising their store networks including [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], John Martins, Stirling and Centre Fair. By 1995, Harris Scarfe had become Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe company ran into trouble during the late 1990s due to rising debts and management issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In April 2001, the business was placed in receivership. Unsecured creditors were owed $93 million, and the company was $50 million in debt.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/former-harris-scarfe-executive-jailed-six-years-20020627-gduc7w.html|title=Former Harris Scarfe executive jailed six years|date=27 June 2002|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 December 2019|url-status=live|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]}}</ref> In June 2002, the company's former chief financial officer, Alan Hodgson, was sentenced to six years in jail, on multiple counts that included giving false information to the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], and failing to act honestly as a company officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Harris Scarfe listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (ASX). In the same year, the company fell $160 million into debt, resulting in the owners, the Trescowthick family, losing $31.5 million. The government initially considered pressing charges against chairman Adam Trescowthick, but later dropped the case.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, the company started a revitalisation program. The store network was remodelled with new products, layouts and new branding. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record growth. By 2007, Sydney-based Momentum Private Equity acquired an $80&nbsp;million majority stake in the company. During 2012, Momentum Corporate ten sold the business to [[Pepkor]], a South African private equity firm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOver a six-month period at the end of 2003, Harris Scarfe made certain representations on a number of items in its catalogues in relation to pricing. Harris Scarfe admitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that representations in its promotional advertising may have misled consumers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/harris-scarfe-admits-sale-prices-may-have-misled-issues-public-apology|title=Harris Scarfe admits sale prices may have misled, issues public apology|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-02-23|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nAgain in 2007 Harris Scarfe was investigated by the Australian consumer watchdog who sued the department store in the Australian Federal Court over allegedly false promotions for its sales in October 2006. The ACCC alleged that the advertising was misleading because Harris Scarfe was not offering what it advertised:\n\n# A discount off all goods in its stores.\n# A minimum of 20% off all goods in its stores.\n\nThe ACCC also alleged that the catalogue included images of products under banners stating a specific discount when some of those goods were not discounted by the stated percentage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartcompany.com.au/marketing/advertising/accc-challenges-harris-scarfe-ads/|title=ACCC challenges Harris Scarfe ads|date=2007-10-12|website=SmartCompany|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Federal Court, Adelaide has declared that Harris Scarfe Australia Pty Ltd misled consumers by representing in a catalogue that certain advertised items were discounted by a specific amount when in fact they were discounted by less than that amount, or were not discounted at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/court-declares-harris-scarfe-misled-consumers|title=Court declares Harris Scarfe misled consumers|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-02-23|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nHarris Scarfe CEO Robert Atkins, resigned from the top post at Harris Scarfe in March 2009 after eight years leading the turnaround of department store.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/exharris-scarfe-boss-robert-atkins-dies-20100115-mb6b.html|title=Ex-Harris Scarfe boss Robert Atkins dies|date=2010-01-15|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> He played a significant role in the restructuring of retail trading hours in South Australia and in the revitalisation of the state\u2019s premium retail precinct as chairman of the Rundle Mall Management Authority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retailbiz.com.au/offline-retailing/former-harris-scarfe-ceo-robert-atkins-dies/|title=Former Harris Scarfe CEO Robert Atkins dies|last=retailbizc0rD8|date=2010-01-15|website=retailbiz|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Robert Atkins passed away in January 2010. \n\nAfter Robert Atkins successful tenure leading Harris Scarfe, Joe Barberis was named managing director of the retailer in February 2009 until September 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://au.linkedin.com/in/joe-barberis-b3a2b96|title=Joe Barberis LinkedIn|last=Barberis|first=Joe|date=11/4/2020|website=LinkedIn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Graham Dean, previously Myer group general manager of Electrical was named CEO of Harris Scarfe. \n\nIn 2012, Kyly Clarke became the face of Harris Scarfe's fashion home brand 'Boutique@hs'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsugar.com.au/fashion/Kyly-Clarke-Face-New-Harris-Scarfe-Fashion-Label-Boutiquehs-25432051|title=Kyly Clarke Is The Face Of New Label Boutique@hs!|last=Rota|first=Genevieve|date=2012-10-14|website=POPSUGAR Fashion Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, Greenlit Brands, formerly [[Steinhoff International|Steinhoff Asia Pacific]], acquired [[Pepkor]] and this included Harris Scarfe.

The corridor runs from [[Parrs Wood]] to [[Manchester city centre]] along [[Wilmslow Road|Wilmslow]] and Oxford Roads, serving [[Didsbury]], [[Withington]], [[Fallowfield]] and [[Rusholme]].\n\nSeveral frequent routes combine to operate along the northern section, providing access to the [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] (MMU) and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] (RNCM), [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]] (MRI) and [[Christie Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyewitness in Manchester - Picture Update |url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/00features/422.html |publisher=Manchester Online |work=Eyewitness in Manchester |accessdate=7 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820100628/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/00features/422.html |archivedate=20 August 2007 }}</ref> Many services along the route are provided by older vehicles (such as the [[Magic Bus (Stagecoach)|Magic Bus]] brand operated by [[Stagecoach Manchester]]).\n\n==Busiest bus corridor in Europe?==\nWilmslow Road is often claimed to be the busiest bus corridor in Europe.<ref name=\"parliament_2006-05-23\">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmtran/1317/1317we18.htm |date=23 May 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |title=Memorandum submitted by the Longsight Transport Project |publisher=[[Transport Select Committee|Select Committee on Transport]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/06/healthandwellbeing.features11 |title=Where cyclists dare|publisher=The Guardian|first=Helen| last=Pidd|date= 2007-03-06|accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeonmanchester.com/oxford-rd-manchester-buses/ |title=Oxford Rd Manchester with Stagecoach bus|publisher=EyeOnManchester|first=Aidan| last=O'Rourke|date= 2006-10-26|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>  However, this is difficult to verify because:\n*No authoritative comparison is available.\n*The bus frequency on Wilmslow Road varies at different points. This will be true of other corridors and hence the busiest corridor is likely to depend on how short a road can be considered.\n*Bus frequencies vary over the day so the busiest corridor may depend on whether the peak frequency or average frequency is taken.\n*No qualifier is given as to what constitutes 'busy' - whether frequency of buses or total passengers carried and when.\n\nThe 3.7&nbsp;mile stretch of route between [[Piccadilly Gardens]] and [[Withington]] has a timetabled average of at least one bus per minute in each direction on Monday to Friday daytimes during university term. However, particularly during rush hour, there are many buses which do not appear on the timetable and rather repeat the journey as frequently as possible.\n\nTwo competing bus companies are the major providers of services along the corridor: [[Stagecoach Manchester]] (including the [[Magic Bus (Stagecoach)|Magic Bus]] brand) and [[First Greater Manchester]]. Both companies run frequent services the whole length of the route. The half mile stretch of route in the city centre between the RNCM and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Oxford Road station]] has a timetabled average of nearly a bus every 30 seconds in each direction.\n\nIn 2006, the Parliamentary [[Transport Select Committee|Select Committee on Transport]] was told:<ref name=\"parliament_2006-05-23\" />\n{{quote|The Wilmslow Road corridor, although enjoying a level of service that no other route in England has in terms of the frequency of buses, is chaos. This is because many companies are running the same route and competing for passengers. Various estimations of patronage have been suggested from research, one as low as 3.5 passengers per bus on average. In actual fact the exact figures are not available to us because of commercial sensitivity. Stagecoach prices along this route are high and smaller companies buy up cheaper, older and dirtier buses and carry passengers for as little as a third of the Stagecoach price. Some of them still carry London posters because they are rejected stock from London, where standards are higher. Observations reported to us suggest that they will wait to fill up with as many passengers as possible rather than sticking to a timetable and there have been reports of some companies waiting at a stop until another company's bus is just behind and then pulling off. Although one has to wait literally seconds for a bus, the congestion at certain junctions because of too many buses and the unwillingness of these buses to stick to timetables makes travelling on this route an unpleasant and stressful one.}}\n\n==History==\n[[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|Bus deregulation]] in 1986 allowed bus companies to run services wherever and whenever they wanted. Prior to this, most bus services along Wilmslow Road had been operated by publicly owned operator [[Transport for Greater Manchester|Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive]].\n\nIn 1986 the bus operation was separated into a stand-alone company, [[GM Buses]]. [[Finglands Coachways]] started operating their own competitive bus services soon after, capitalising on the lack of capacity for students along the route,<ref>Millar, p.25</ref> and were soon followed by other coach operators such as Wall's<ref>{{cite web |title=Walls of Fallowfield |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/niagarekoja/425107484/ |work=Flickr |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref> and [[Bullocks Coaches|Bullocks]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bullock, Cheadle A301 JFA |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/iantherev/2345101129/ |work=Flickr |date=17 July 1995 |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nGM Buses fought back by reintroducing crew-operated buses to the route. Ten [[AEC Routemaster]]s were acquired from [[London]] in 1988 and operated on route 143 to [[Didsbury|West Didsbury]], branded as the \"Piccadilly Line\" after the [[Piccadilly line|London Underground line]]. They operated until June 1990 when they were replaced with standard vehicles.<ref>Brown, p.128</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/5th-july-1990/21/victorians-on-the-mancunian-line Victorians on the Mancurian line] ''Commercial Motor'' 5 July 1990 page 21</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=GM Buses 2207 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/boxley/1042239656/ |work=Flickr |date=7 April 1991 |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref> Larger operators also operated competing services along Wilmslow Road during the 1990s, including [[North Western Road Car Company (1986)|Bee Line]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Bee Line 656 PFM129Y |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/15218213@N06/3324178360/ |work=Flickr |accessdate=28 June 2009}}</ref> and [[MTL (transport company)#MTL Manchester|MTL Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web |title=MTL Manchester ex-Maidstone & District Leyland National VKE570S |url=http://ukbusphotosfromthe80s90s.fotopic.net/p58399688.html |work=UK Bus Photos from the 80s & 90s |publisher=Fotopic |accessdate=28 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe southern half of GM Buses was sold to [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] in February 1996,<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/pensioners-lead-protest-at-pounds-41m-stagecoach-takeover-1321229.html Pensioners lead protest at \u00a341m Stagecoach takeover] ''The Independent'' 26 February 1996</ref> who introduced the \"[[no frills]]\" [[Magic Bus (Stagecoach)|Magic Bus]] services along the route in competition with their main routes.

Since 2018, First no longer operate on route 42, with Stagecoach becoming the sole operator.\n\nRoute 42 serves the busy [[Wilmslow Road bus corridor]], which includes universities and hospitals operating via university of Manchester, Rusholme, Fallowfield, Withington, Didsbury, East Didsbury and Heaton Mersey.\n\n====Route 42B====\nRoute 42B operates every 30 minutes along the entire route from Manchester to Parrs Wood and continues on to [[Woodford, Greater Manchester|Woodford]] via [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], [[Cheadle Hulme]] and [[Bramhall]]. It is operated by Stagecoach Manchester. Evening journeys operate between Parrs Wood and Woodford only without using the Wilmslow Road corridor. 42b is the updated all-stop replacement for X57/145 which operated morning only Cheadle Hulme to Albert Square one-way.\n\n====Route 43====\n[[Greater Manchester bus route 43|Route 43]] is operated by Stagecoach Manchester, every 10 minutes. It operates from Piccadilly bus station to West Didsbury, then on to [[Manchester Airport]] via Northenden, [[Benchill]], [[Wythenshawe]] and [[Woodhouse Park]]. It is the only 24-hour bus route in Greater Manchester and the only bus route the runs every day year round, even on Christmas Day and New Year. Along with Stagecoach Manchester route 42, it was the first Stagecoach routes to use hybrid buses.\n\n====Routes 142/143/147 ====\n{{see also|Magic Bus (Stagecoach)}}\n[[Magic Bus (Stagecoach)|Magic Bus]] operate route 142 between Manchester and East Didsbury and also its sister routes 143 between Manchester and West Didsbury and also route 147 between Travis Street (Manchester Piccadilly) to West Didsbury. These high-frequency services are operated by Stagecoach Manchester under the '''Magic Bus''' brand. Stagecoach use slightly older buses on these routes and ticket prices are cheaper than commercial Stagecoach services. Route 142 operates short journeys between Universities and Withington and extra journeys at peak times to cater specifically for students. The 143 service to Sale replaced the limited stop X41 which had a much higher demand, however, the route now operates only two journeys a week during college times along this section of the route, with all other services terminating at West Didsbury\n\n====Routes V1/V2/V4====\nRoutes V1, V2 and V4 are part of the Vantage Guided Busway network ran by First Greater Manchester. The V1 and V2 use very high spec branded buses and run from the MRI to Leigh (V1) and Atherton (V2) via St Peters Square, Pendleton and Tyldesley. Route V4 provides peak time extras between Ellensbrook and the MRI using standard First vehicles.\n\n=== Minor routes ===\n====Route 18====\nRoute 18 is operated by First Greater Manchester runs every 20 minutes from Rusholme to Manchester via the hospitals and universities, then crosses the city centre and continues to [[Langley, Greater Manchester|Langley]] via [[Harpurhey]] and [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manchestertransport.wordpress.com/2012/10/07/the-revival-of-cross-city-bus-services-in-manchester |title=The revival of cross-city bus services in Manchester |author=Martin Bryant |date=7 October 2012 |publisher=Manchester Transport |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfgm.com/journey_planning/RouteMaps/18_12-1578.pdf |title=Bus Times Bus 18 |publisher=TfGM |accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Routes 23/171/172====\nRoute 23 is operated by Stagecoach Manchester every 15 minutes, and runs from Stockport to the [[Trafford Centre]] via Heaton Mersey, Didsbury, Chorlton, Stretford, Urmston and Davyhulme,The 23 route once operated alongside sister routes 24 and 23A, which operated the same route between Stockport and Stretford but then on to MediaCity (24) and via Lostock instead of Urmston (23A) at a combined frequency of every 10 minutes, route 24 was withdrawn in 2017 due to much lower than expected patronage, most likely due to Metrolink connectivity in the areas it served, lowering the combined frequency to every 15 minutes and long running service 23A was withdrawn in April 2019 and the section in \nLostock is now served by the 25. . . Routes 171 and 172 are operated by Stagecoach Manchester, running every 30 minutes to Newton Heath from Chorlton/West Didsbury (172) and East Didsbury (171) bus 171 goes via Didsbury, Burnage, Levenshulme, Gorton and Clayton while bus 172 goes via Fog Lane instead of Wilmslow Road.\n\n====Route 53====\nRoute 53 is operated by [[Go North West]] every 30 minutes, and runs from [[Cheetham Hill]] to [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], via [[North Manchester General Hospital]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Gorton]], [[Belle Vue, Greater Manchester|Belle Vue]], [[Rusholme]], [[University of Manchester]] and [[Old Trafford (district)|Old Trafford]]\n\n====Other routes====\nSeveral other routes operate on the route, such as school services, which are unmarked.

The corridor runs from [[Parrs Wood]] to [[Manchester city centre]] along [[Wilmslow Road|Wilmslow]] and Oxford Roads, serving [[Didsbury]], [[Withington]], [[Fallowfield]] and [[Rusholme]].\n\nSeveral frequent routes combine to operate along the northern section, providing access to the [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] (MMU) and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] (RNCM), [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]] (MRI) and [[Christie Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyewitness in Manchester - Picture Update |url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/00features/422.html |publisher=Manchester Online |work=Eyewitness in Manchester |accessdate=7 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820100628/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/00features/422.html |archivedate=20 August 2007 }}</ref> Many services along the route are provided by older vehicles (such as the [[Magic Bus (Stagecoach)|Magic Bus]] brand operated by [[Stagecoach Manchester]]).\n\n==Busiest bus corridor in Europe?==\nWilmslow Road is often claimed to be the busiest bus corridor in Europe.<ref name=\"parliament_2006-05-23\">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmtran/1317/1317we18.htm |date=23 May 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |title=Memorandum submitted by the Longsight Transport Project |publisher=[[Transport Select Committee|Select Committee on Transport]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/06/healthandwellbeing.features11 |title=Where cyclists dare|publisher=The Guardian|first=Helen| last=Pidd|date= 2007-03-06|accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeonmanchester.com/oxford-rd-manchester-buses/ |title=Oxford Rd Manchester with Stagecoach bus|publisher=EyeOnManchester|first=Aidan| last=O'Rourke|date= 2006-10-26|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>  However, this is difficult to verify because:\n*No authoritative comparison is available.\n*The bus frequency on Wilmslow Road varies at different points. This will be true of other corridors and hence the busiest corridor is likely to depend on how short a road can be considered.\n*Bus frequencies vary over the day so the busiest corridor may depend on whether the peak frequency or average frequency is taken.\n*No qualifier is given as to what constitutes 'busy' - whether frequency of buses or total passengers carried and when.\n\nThe 3.7&nbsp;mile stretch of route between [[Piccadilly Gardens]] and [[Withington]] has a timetabled average of at least one bus per minute in each direction on Monday to Friday daytimes during university term. However, particularly during rush hour, there are many buses which do not appear on the timetable and rather repeat the journey as frequently as possible.\n\nTwo competing bus companies are the major providers of services along the corridor: [[Stagecoach Manchester]] (including the [[Magic Bus (Stagecoach)|Magic Bus]] brand) and [[First Greater Manchester]]. Both companies run frequent services the whole length of the route. The half mile stretch of route in the city centre between the RNCM and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Oxford Road station]] has a timetabled average of nearly a bus every 30 seconds in each direction.\n\nIn 2006, the Parliamentary [[Transport Select Committee|Select Committee on Transport]] was told:<ref name=\"parliament_2006-05-23\" />\n{{quote|The Wilmslow Road corridor, although enjoying a level of service that no other route in England has in terms of the frequency of buses, is chaos. This is because many companies are running the same route and competing for passengers. Various estimations of patronage have been suggested from research, one as low as 3.5 passengers per bus on average. In actual fact the exact figures are not available to us because of commercial sensitivity. Stagecoach prices along this route are high and smaller companies buy up cheaper, older and dirtier buses and carry passengers for as little as a third of the Stagecoach price. Some of them still carry London posters because they are rejected stock from London, where standards are higher. Observations reported to us suggest that they will wait to fill up with as many passengers as possible rather than sticking to a timetable and there have been reports of some companies waiting at a stop until another company's bus is just behind and then pulling off. Although one has to wait literally seconds for a bus, the congestion at certain junctions because of too many buses and the unwillingness of these buses to stick to timetables makes travelling on this route an unpleasant and stressful one.}}\n\n==History==\n[[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|Bus deregulation]] in 1986 allowed bus companies to run services wherever and whenever they wanted. Prior to this, most bus services along Wilmslow Road had been operated by publicly owned operator [[Transport for Greater Manchester|Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive]].\n\nIn 1986 the bus operation was separated into a stand-alone company, [[GM Buses]]. [[Finglands Coachways]] started operating their own competitive bus services soon after, capitalising on the lack of capacity for students along the route,<ref>Millar, p.25</ref> and were soon followed by other coach operators such as Wall's<ref>{{cite web |title=Walls of Fallowfield |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/niagarekoja/425107484/ |work=Flickr |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref> and [[Bullocks Coaches|Bullocks]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bullock, Cheadle A301 JFA |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/iantherev/2345101129/ |work=Flickr |date=17 July 1995 |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nGM Buses fought back by reintroducing crew-operated buses to the route. Ten [[AEC Routemaster]]s were acquired from [[London]] in 1988 and operated on route 143 to [[Didsbury|West Didsbury]], branded as the \"Piccadilly Line\" after the [[Piccadilly line|London Underground line]].
