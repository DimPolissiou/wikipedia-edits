For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the interwar period Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and on international arena the creation of Jewish state in Palestine.

With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wroc\u0142aw in 1273\u201390, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 \u2013 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wroc\u0142aw in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Prince Boles\u0142aw of Kalisz's ''privilegium'' tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: \u201cAccusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited.

He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir\u2019s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]].

In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Pozna\u0144 in 1399.

Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Krak\u00f3w in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]\n\nIn 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|1492 example of Spanish rulers]], banished the Jews from Lithuania.

The latter decreed in 1495 to expel the Jews from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] when he was the Grand Duke of Lithuania but reversed his decision eight years later in 1503 after becoming King of Poland.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.\n\n[[Moses Isserles]] (1520\u20131572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. In addition to being a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], Isserles was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy.

The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility. The Jews, perceived as allies of the nobles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.\n\nRuled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]]. The kingdom of Poland which had already suffered from the Chmielnicki Uprising and from the recurring invasions of the Russians, [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], became the scene of even more atrocities. [[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Krak\u00f3w (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, {{Fact?|date=July 2018}} the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n[[File:PolishJews3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Jewish couple in Poland, around 1765.]]\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy.

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]].

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793.

The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.<ref name=\"Alexander_I\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as \"[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second\", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\"/> The 1827 decree by Nicolas \u2013 while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service \u2013 made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 \"souls\" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion.

It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 \u2013 an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.\n\n===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]]]]\nThe assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043c}};) throughout 1881\u20131884.

Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

Estimating the population increase and the emigration from Poland between 1931 and 1939, there were probably 3,474,000 Jews in Poland as of 1 September 1939 (approximately 10% of the total population) primarily centered in large and smaller cities: 77% lived in cities and 23% in the villages. They made up about 50%, and in some cases even 70% of the population of smaller towns, especially in Eastern Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.kalisz.pl/Statut/JewsWar2.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006072443/http://www.info.kalisz.pl/statut/jewswar2.htm|url-status=dead|title=Jews in Poland \u2013 Polish Jews in World War II|archivedate=6 October 2008}}</ref> Prior to World War II, the Jewish population of [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] numbered about 233,000, roughly one-third of the city\u2019s population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/lodz-poland-jewish-history-tour|title=Lodz, Poland Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref> The city of [[Lw\u00f3w]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) had the third largest Jewish population in Poland, numbering 110,000 in 1939 (42%).

Jews owned land and real estate, participated in retail and manufacturing and in the export industry. Their religious beliefs spanned the range from Orthodox [[Hasidic Judaism]] to [[Reform Judaism|Liberal Judaism]].\n\nThe Polish language, rather than [[Yiddish]], was increasingly used by the young Warsaw Jews who did not have a problem in identifying themselves fully as Jews, Varsovians and Poles. Jews such as [[Bruno Schulz]] were entering the mainstream of Polish society, though many thought of themselves as a separate nationality within Poland. Most children were enrolled in Jewish religious schools, which used to limit their ability to speak Polish. As a result, according to the 1931 census, 79% of the Jews declared Yiddish as their first language, and only 12% listed Polish, with the remaining 9% being Hebrew.<ref name=\"GUS1931\">{{cite book |url=http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a22_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |title=Drugi Powszechny Spis Ludno\u015bci z dn. 9.XII.1931 r.

Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] was also a writer. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots e.g. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Bia\u0142ostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.\n\nMany Jews were film producers and directors, e.g. [[Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski]] (''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk)]]'', [[Aleksander Ford]] (''[[Children Must Laugh]]'').\n\n[[File:Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimon Peres]], born in Poland as Szymon Perski,  served as the ninth [[President of Israel]] between 2007 and 2014]]\n\nScientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science. Other Polish Jews who gained international recognition are [[Moses Schorr]], [[Ludwik Zamenhof]] (the creator of [[Esperanto]]), [[Georges Charpak]], [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], just to name a few from the long list. The term \"[[genocide]]\" was coined by [[Rafa\u0142 Lemkin]] (1900\u20131959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\nThere also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Krak\u00f3w]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[J\u00f3zef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]]. Another athlete, [[Alojzy Ehrlich]], won several medals in the table-tennis tournaments.

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Bia\u0142ystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. Several dozen guerrillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Bia\u0142ystok where they joined the partisan units of [[Armia Krajowa]] and other organisations and survived the war.\n\n==Communist rule: 1945\u20131989==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n\n===Number of Holocaust survivors===\nThe estimates of Polish Jews before the war vary from slightly under 3 million to almost 3.5 million ([[Polish census of 1931|the last nationwide census was conducted in 1931]]).<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nThe number of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust is difficult to ascertain.

There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]].

Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience.

[[Jewish Cemetery, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria and [[Le\u017cajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town. Candelabras, chandeliers, a menorah and a [[Ner Tamid|ner tamid]] were found and can now be seen at the Auschwitz Jewish Center.<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Memorial]] was unveiled on 19 April 1948\u2014the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw ghetto Uprising. It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].\n\nPolish authors and scholars have published many works about history of Jews in Poland. Notable among them are the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]'s [[Holocaust studies]] journal {{ill|Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w. Studia i Materia\u0142y|pl|Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w.

The synagogue, the sole synagogue in O\u015bwi\u0119cim to survive World War II and an adjacent Jewish cultural and educational center, provide visitors a place to pray and to learn about the active pre\u2013World War II Jewish community that existed in O\u015bwi\u0119cim. The synagogue was the first communal property in the country to be returned to the Jewish community under the 1997 law allowing for restitution of Jewish communal property.<ref name=\"Poland, International Religious Freedom Report\"/></blockquote>\nThe [[March of the Living]] is an annual event in April held since 1988 to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the interwar period Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and on international arena the creation of Jewish state in Palestine.

For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies.

Prominent among such rulers was [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wroc\u0142aw in 1273\u201390, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 \u2013 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wroc\u0142aw in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Prince Boles\u0142aw of Kalisz's ''privilegium'' tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: \u201cAccusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited.

Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and [[Kazimierz]] near Krak\u00f3w (1386).<ref name=polishjews.org/> Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]<ref name=\"opoczno-1\"/> was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries \"King of the [[serf]]s and Jews.\" Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir\u2019s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]].

In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Pozna\u0144 in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.<ref name=\"Dubnow-3\"/> Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Krak\u00f3w and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Krak\u00f3w in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]\n\nIn 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|1492 example of Spanish rulers]], banished the Jews from Lithuania.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.\n\n[[Moses Isserles]] (1520\u20131572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. In addition to being a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], Isserles was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy. The [[Remuh Synagogue]] was built for him in 1557.

The Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands.

The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility. The Jews, perceived as allies of the nobles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.\n\nRuled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]]. The kingdom of Poland which had already suffered from the Chmielnicki Uprising and from the recurring invasions of the Russians, [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], became the scene of even more atrocities. [[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Krak\u00f3w (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, {{Fact?|date=July 2018}} the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n[[File:PolishJews3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Jewish couple in Poland, around 1765.]]\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy.

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support.

It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 \u2013 an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.\n\n===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]]]]\nThe assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043c}};) throughout 1881\u20131884.

Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement. The pogroms prompted a great wave of Jewish emigration to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Russia/Russian_Empire|title=Russian Empire|last=Stanislawski|first=Michael|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}</ref>\n\nAn even bloodier wave of pogroms broke out from 1903 to 1906, at least some of them believed to have been organized by the Tsarist Russian secret police, the ''[[Okhrana]]''. They included the [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

Jewish political parties, both the [[Socialist]] [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), as well as parties of the Zionist right and left wing and religious conservative movements, were represented in the ''[[Sejm]]'' (the Polish Parliament) as well as in the regional councils.<ref>Yad Vashem, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013543/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=7694&lang=EN&type_id=&addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F7694.JPG  The Bund Council in August 1937, Warsaw, Poland.] Film and Photo Archive.</ref>\n[[File:Isaac Bashevis Singer (upright).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (Polish: Izaak Zynger), achieved international acclaim as a classic Jewish writer and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1978]]\n\nThe Jewish cultural scene <ref>Aleksander Hertz, Lucjan Dobroszycki [https://books.google.com/books?id=APRYwrQWy-AC&dq=jews+in+polish+culture&printsec=frontcover The Jews in Polish culture], Northwestern University Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-8101-0758-9}}</ref> was particularly vibrant in pre\u2013World War II Poland, with numerous Jewish publications and more than one hundred periodicals. Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] was also a writer. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots e.g. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Bia\u0142ostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.\n\nMany Jews were film producers and directors, e.g. [[Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski]] (''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk)]]'', [[Aleksander Ford]] (''[[Children Must Laugh]]'').\n\n[[File:Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimon Peres]], born in Poland as Szymon Perski,  served as the ninth [[President of Israel]] between 2007 and 2014]]\n\nScientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science. Other Polish Jews who gained international recognition are [[Moses Schorr]], [[Ludwik Zamenhof]] (the creator of [[Esperanto]]), [[Georges Charpak]], [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], just to name a few from the long list. The term \"[[genocide]]\" was coined by [[Rafa\u0142 Lemkin]] (1900\u20131959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\nThere also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Krak\u00f3w]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[J\u00f3zef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]].

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

The system of the camps was expanded over the course of the German occupation of Poland and their purposes were diversified; some served as transit camps, some as [[forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor camps]] and the majority as death camps. While in the death camps, the victims were usually killed shortly after arrival, in the other camps able-bodied Jews were worked and beaten to death.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/history.html History of the Holocaust \u2013 An Introduction].

The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest in all of World War II, with 380,000 people crammed into an area of {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}}. The [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000 prisoners.

Ghettos were also established in hundreds of smaller settlements and villages around the country. The overcrowding, dirt, lice, lethal epidemics such as [[typhoid]] and hunger all resulted in countless deaths.\n{{further|Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland}}\n[[File:The Wall of ghetto in Warsaw - Building on Nazi-German order August 1940.jpg|thumb|Walling-off [[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyska Street, Warsaw|\u015awi\u0119tokrzyska Street]] (seen from [[Marsza\u0142kowska Street, Warsaw|Marsza\u0142kowska Street]] on the \"Aryan side\")]]\n\nDuring the occupation of Poland, the Germans used various laws to separate ethnic Poles from Jewish ones.

The ghetto was established by the German [[General Gouvernment|Governor-General]] [[Hans Frank]] on 16 October 1940. Initially, almost 140,000 Jews were moved into the ghetto from all parts of Warsaw. At the same time approximately 110,000 Poles had been forcibly evicted from the area.

However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans. On 22 July 1942, [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|the mass deportation]] of the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began.{{sfn|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|2014|pp=10\u201314}} During the next fifty-two days (until 12 September 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by freight train to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].

The Jewish fighters also received support from the Polish Underground ([[Armia Krajowa]]). The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the \u017bOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], died fighting on 8 May 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.\n[[File:Gesiowka commemorative plaque at 34 Anielewicza Street.JPG|thumb|left|34 [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] Street, Warsaw, Poland]]\n\nIt took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on T\u0142omackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.\n\nA group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.\n[[File:Gesiowka.jpg|thumb|right|Freed prisoners of [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] and the ''[[Szare Szeregi]]'' fighters after the liberation of the camp in August 1944]]\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland.

With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).<ref name=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide\"/> Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.\n\n====The Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto and its uprising====\n{{main|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto}}\n{{further|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising}}\nIn August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Bia\u0142ystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Bia\u0142ystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].

At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another. The so-called \"Partisan\" faction blamed the Jews who had held office during the Stalinist period for the excesses that had occurred, but the end result was that most of the remaining Polish Jews, regardless of their background or political affiliation, were targeted by the communist authorities.<ref>AP Online, \"Some Jewish exiles to have Polish citizenship restored this week\", 3 October 1998, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812044919/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19804342.html]</ref>\n\nThere were several outcomes of the ''[[March 1968 events]]''.

Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944\u201389 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).\n[[File:Rabin Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Rabbi of Poland \u2013 [[Michael Schudrich]]]]\n\n[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]\n[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]\n\nJewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.\n\nA large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], [[Kielce]], or [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga (\"Old Synagogue\") in Krak\u00f3w, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw.

At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis.

It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006.

[[Kahu-Jo-Darro]] is an ancient Buddhist archaeological site near [[Mirpurkhas]] were a Buddhist [[stupa]] was excavated.\n\nThe first arrival of [[Islam]] in the [[South Asia]] took place in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. There has been a number of sites within the province that have led archaeologists to suggest this. [[Makli Hill]] is one of the largest [[Necropolis|necropolises]] in the world. The site is home to a number of ancient tombs and graves of Islamic dynasties. The [[Talpur]] [[Mirs]] of [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] also left a number of sites including, [[Tombs of Talpur Mirs]], Faiz Mahal in [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Khairpur]], [[Qasim fort]], [[Pacco Qillo]] and the [[Kot Diji Fort]] in [[Kot Diji]]. Another fort built during the Islam invasion was the [[Ranikot Fort]]. Like other provinces, Sindh has a number of cultural shrines and mausoleums including [[Thatta]], [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]], [[Lal Shahbaz Qalander]], [[Shahjahan Mosque]], [[Mazar-e-Quaid]], Minar-e-Mir Masum Shah, [[Bhambore]] and [[Garhi Khuda Bakhsh]].\n\n[[Karachi]] is the provincial capital of the province and [[List of most populous metropolitan areas in Pakistan|largest city]] of [[Pakistan]]. It is home to the founder of the nation, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]. His tomb, [[Mazar-e-Quaid]], is the most iconic mausoleum in Pakistan. The city has the largest port in the country, [[Port of Karachi]], followed by the second largest, [[Port Qasim]]. Karachi has also been ruled under a number of tribes which meant the city is home to a number of cultural sites including, [[Mohatta Palace]], [[National Museum of Pakistan]], [[Empress Market]], [[Frere Hall]], [[Jehangir Kothari Parade]], [[Karachi Municipal Corporation Building]] and the [[Hindu Gymkhana, Karachi|Hindu Gymkhana]]. There are also several beaches within the city, some of the most famous are [[Clifton Beach, Karachi|Clifton Beach]], [[French Beach, Karachi|French Beach]], [[Sandspit Beach]] and [[Manora Island]].\n\nThe province also forms the basin for the [[Indus river]]. This has led to a number of lakes being formed in the province. Some of the most notable ones include: [[Keenjhar Lake]], [[Manchar (lake)|Manchar Lake]] and the Bakri Waro Lake in [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Khairpur]]. The [[Kirthar National Park]] is also a protected reserve for several wildlife species within the region. The [[Thar Desert]] is also located in the province which adjoins it to [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and India. The [[Great Rann of Kutch]] is a protected wetland site in the province. There are two wildlife sanctuaries in the province: [[Rann of Kutch Wildlife Sanctuary]] and the [[Nara Desert Wildlife Sanctuary]]. The [[Sukkur Barrage]] is another famous icon in the province it was built to alleviate [[Famine|famines]] caused by lack of rain.\n\n[[Port Grand Food and Entertainment Complex]] is a recreational area built in the centre of [[Karachi]], Pakistan along the waterfront of the 19th-century [[Native Jetty Bridge]] that connects the [[Karachi Port Trust]] to [[Keamari]]. The complex is expected to attract up to 5,000 visitors a day and is a major hub of shopping, dining, cultural and coastal recreational activities in the city. Port Grand is located on Napier Mole Bridge a site that is very significant to the history of Karachi and has played a crucial role in making it the city it is today. The project stretches along 1,000&nbsp;ft of Karachi's ancient 19th-century Native Jetty Bridge and spreads over an area of 200,000 sq. ft. The one-kilometre bridge has been transformed into an entertainment and food enclave housing numerous eateries totalling 40,000 sq. ft of climate-controlled area and space for kiosks of exotic Pakistani and foreign food and a variety of beverages. To get to the Port Grand from anywhere in the city, Port Grand is a straight shot west out of Mai Kolachi, adjacent to the PNSC Building as the road curves into the facility on the right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/177989/good-times-port-grand-finally-makes-a-grand-opening/|title=Good times: Port Grand finally makes a grand opening \u2013 The Express Tribune|date=29 May 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Azad Jammu and Kashmir ===\n{{main|Tourism in Azad Kashmir}}\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"px\">\nFile:Kel Taobut Road Neelum Valley AJK.JPG|[[Taobat]], [[Neelum Valley]]\nFile:Saral Lake proper.jpg|[[Saral Lake]], [[Neelum Valley]]\nFile:View From Sharda Fort, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan.jpg| A View of [[Sharda, Azad Kashmir]]\nFile:Ganga Choti.jpg|[[Ganga Choti]], [[Bagh District|Bagh]]\n</gallery>[[Azad Kashmir]] is the region of Pakistan situated in Northern part of the country.

With more and more foreign investment and funding, Pakistan was able to build its major road and air networks to cater to mass movements of cargo and inter-city travel. Roads are being developed by several consultants from the [[Northern Areas]] all the way down to the [[Port of Karachi]].\n\nStatistics from the last decade show tourism is a \"market led industry and not supply driven\" which has led to a large decline in travel to Pakistan. This has led to fewer tour agencies being set up and development of historical sites. It has been estimated that the public and private sectors have gradually earned less income from the tourism market causing less investment and innovation within the industry. This has led to several sites to depreciate over time and the lack of minimum international standards have left many sites in poor states. The latest budget showed that less money was being spent on research and marketing and more on defence and other fixed markets.\n\nThe 2017 World Economic forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report (TTCR) ranked Pakistan 125th out of 136 countries.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2017/country-profiles/#economy=PAK|title=Country profiles|publisher=}}</ref> Low branding and marketing effectiveness and low priority the government gave to the travel and tourism industry.\n\n===[[Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation]]===\nSome have encouraged the government to again attract tourists to Pakistan by initiating the sponsorship of new businesses in the tourist market: building and maintaining the road and air networks to meet international standards. The maturation of human and natural resources can also contribute to the development of this feeble industry. Advertising campaigns need to attract tourist by developing holiday packages tailored to explore the greater regions of the country.\n\nIn September 2004 with the bifurcation of the Minorities, Culture, Sports,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crimaz.org |title=Wrestling |publisher=John Douglas}}</ref> Tourism and Youth Affairs, tourism was given a separate status of [[Ministry of Tourism (Pakistan)|Ministry of Tourism]].

Long before the creation of Pakistan in 1947, there were cultures and religions that existed before the [[Partition of India|independence]]. Pakistan's being the centre of various wars led to several dynasties and tribes ruling its lands. They left landmarks behind which some have become national icons whilst others needing the attention of concerned authorities.

With more and more foreign investment and funding, Pakistan was able to build its major road and air networks to cater to mass movements of cargo and inter-city travel. Roads are being developed by several consultants from the [[Northern Areas]] all the way down to the [[Port of Karachi]].\n\nStatistics from the last decade show tourism is a \"market led industry and not supply driven\" which has led to a large decline in travel to Pakistan. This has led to fewer tour agencies being set up and development of historical sites. It has been estimated that the public and private sectors have gradually earned less income from the tourism market causing less investment and innovation within the industry. This has led to several sites to depreciate over time and the lack of minimum international standards have left many sites in poor states. The latest budget showed that less money was being spent on research and marketing and more on defence and other fixed markets.\n\nThe 2017 World Economic forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report (TTCR) ranked Pakistan 125th out of 136 countries.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2017/country-profiles/#economy=PAK|title=Country profiles|publisher=}}</ref> Low branding and marketing effectiveness and low priority the government gave to the travel and tourism industry.\n\n===[[Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation]]===\nSome have encouraged the government to again attract tourists to Pakistan by initiating the sponsorship of new businesses in the tourist market: building and maintaining the road and air networks to meet international standards. The maturation of human and natural resources can also contribute to the development of this feeble industry. Advertising campaigns need to attract tourist by developing holiday packages tailored to explore the greater regions of the country.\n\nIn September 2004 with the bifurcation of the Minorities, Culture, Sports,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crimaz.org |title=Wrestling |publisher=John Douglas}}</ref> Tourism and Youth Affairs, tourism was given a separate status of [[Ministry of Tourism (Pakistan)|Ministry of Tourism]]. The Ministry of Tourism was responsible for the policy formulation, development, marketing and promotion of foreign and domestic tourism besides coordination and regulating of federal and provincial governments and private sector activities responsible and involved in tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prr.hec.gov.pk/Chapters/7S-5.pdf |title=Analysis Tourism Management In Pakistan |accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Golden Peak & Sillhoutte of 3 South Koreans.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[South Korea]]n tourists at the Golden Peak in [[Hunza\u2013Nagar District]], [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]]]\nHowever, it was not able to achieve any of its objectives and was abolished under Constitutional requirements in Pakistan on June 30, 2011. The promotions of tourism were transferred to the provinces. Now each province runs its own organization that is responsible for tourism.

Its [[Rock Hill Downtown Historic District|historic downtown]] consist of twelve contiguous buildings built as early as 1840 offering dining and retail options. The city is also home to three colleges, including [[Winthrop University]], a public liberal arts university founded in 1886 which enrolls nearly 6,000 students annually.\n\n==History==\n[[File:U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (Rock Hill, South Carolina) 1933.jpg|thumb|right|Historic post office in Rock Hill]]\n\n===Pre-colonization===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nProceeding cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] lived in the Piedmont for thousands of years.  The historic [[Catawba Indian Nation]], a traditionally [[Siouan]]-speaking tribe, was here at the time of European encounter.  Currently the only tribe in South Carolina that is federally recognized, its members live near Rock Hill.\n\n===Early colonization===\n\nAlthough some European settlers had already arrived in the Rock Hill area in the 1830s and 1840s, Rock Hill did not become an actual town until the [[Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad]] Company made the decision to send a rail line through the area. Originally, the railroad had hoped to build a station in the nearby village of [[Ebenezer, South Carolina|Ebenezerville]] which was squarely between [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. When approached, however, the locals in Ebenezerville refused to have the railroad run through their village since they considered it dirty and noisy. Instead, engineers and surveyors decided to run the line two miles away by a local landmark. According to some, the engineers marked the spot on the map and named it \"rocky hill.\"<ref name=Willoughby>{{cite book|last=Willoughby|first=Lynn|title=The \"Good Town\" Does Well: Rock Hill, S.C., 1852\u20132002|year=2002|publisher=Written in Stone|location=Orangeburg, South Carolina|isbn=0-9669707-2-1}}</ref>{{RP|page=26}}\n\nSome of Rock Hill's early founding families\u2014the White family, the Black family, and the Moores\u2014believed that having a rail depot so close to them would be advantageous, so they decided to give the Columbia and Charlotte Railroad the right of way through their properties. As the three largest landowners in the area, this settled the matter. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|George Pendleton White]] contracted with the railroad to build a section of the line. Construction began in 1848. The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. A few weeks later, on April 17, 1852, the first Rock Hill Post Office opened.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=26\u201328}}\n\nNow that Rock Hill had a name, a railroad station, and a post office, it began to draw more settlers to the area. Captain J. H. McGinnis built a small general store near the station in 1849 or 1850 to provide supplies for the construction and railroad workers.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=27\u201328}} Templeton Black, who had leased the land to McGinnis, decided to devote some of his other adjacent land to building a larger town. He hired a local surveyor, Squire John Roddey, to organize a main street. Black sold his first plot of land along that street to Ira Ferguson for $125 a few weeks before the post office opened; other businessmen bought plots quickly after that.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\nRock Hill Academy, the first school in Rock Hill, opened in September 1854. Despite its official name, most residents referred to it as the Pine Grove Academy after the pine grove it was located in. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|Ann Hutchinson White]], wife of George White, donated the land to the school after her husband's death. The school had 60 male pupils in 1856; a school for girls was later opened in the same place.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\n====Other significant facts and dates====\n* Pre-December 1857: The ''Indian Land Chronicle'', Rock Hill's first newspaper, begins publishing.  After a change in ownership, it was renamed ''The Rock Hill Chronicle'' in 1860.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n* Pre-1860: Rock Hill had at least two doctors: Robert Hervey Hope and William Barron Fewell<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n\n===During the American Civil War===\n\nShortly before the [[American Civil War]] began a census had been taken of the population in York County, where Rock Hill is located. Half of the district's 21,800 residents were slaves, integral to local cotton production. The 4,379 white males in the county formed fourteen infantry companies; some of the men joined cavalry or artillery units instead. By the end of the war, 805 of these men were dead, and hundreds more were wounded. Men from Rock Hill and York County were involved in many of the major Civil War battles.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=35}}\n\nDue to its position on the railroad, Rock Hill became a transfer point for Confederate soldiers and supplies moving to and from the front. Since there was no local hospital, townspeople nursed sick and wounded soldiers in their homes. Refugees fleeing the coastal blockade or [[William T. Sherman|General Sherman's]] troops also came to Rock Hill.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}}\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1862, local area farmers switched from cotton to corn in order to produce more food.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}} Records show that prices in Rock Hill changed frequently during the war, reflecting both shortages and the inflation of the [[Confederate money|Confederate paper money]].<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}}\n\n[[P. G. T. Beauregard|Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard]] set up a temporary headquarters in Rock Hill on February 21, 1865.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}} He ordered the roads to Charlotte blocked to try to prevent General Sherman from reaching the city; Sherman ultimately went in a different direction.\n\nWhen [[Robert E. Lee|General Lee]] surrendered at the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], it was actually a future Rock Hill resident who was responsible for waving the white flag. Captain Robert Moorman Sims, a farmer from Lancaster County, was sent by [[James Longstreet|General James Longstreet]] to inform Union troops that the Confederate troops wanted a truce.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=42}}\n\n===Post-Civil War===\n\nThe Civil War changed the social, economic, and political situation in Rock Hill tremendously, as it did elsewhere in the South.  Rock Hill grew as a town, taking in war refugees, widows and their families, and the return of the men who had left to fight the war.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=58}} The formerly wealthy elite sold off their land to stay afloat financially.  Town life began to become more important than rural life.\n\nMost of the merchants in Rock Hill around 1870 were former Confederate soldiers; many were entrepreneurs who were new to town, trying to start over.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=59}} In 1870, even the largest stores in Rock Hill were only one storey tall, and there were no sidewalks on the roads. The first drug store in Rock Hill opened in the 1870s.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}} A locally contentious bordello was built in 1881 and introduced the town's first paved sidewalk.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}}\n\n===Incorporation===\n\nThe town was not officially incorporated until 1870, on the third try.\n\nThe first attempt to get Rock Hill incorporated was made in 1855. A petition, signed by major landholders and businessmen from the Rock Hill area, was presented to the General Assembly on October 19, 1855.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=29}} No action on the matter was taken by the General Assembly.\n\nThe second attempt was in 1868. In their petition, the townspeople claimed that Rock Hill had over 300 residents, \"eleven stores, two churches, two bars, two hotels, two carriage shops, three blacksmith shops, three shoe shops, one tannery, one cabinet shop, and elementary schools for white girls and boys.\" The petition was signed by 48 men, most relative newcomers to Rock Hill, with only a few members of the old, established, landed families. The larger landholders opposed incorporation because of the taxes it would bring.  They filed a counter-proposal which claimed that there were only 100 residents, many of them temporary.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=63}} The situation was a strong indication of the changes Rock Hill experienced as it transitioned from mostly farms to a business community. Ultimately, the state legislature did not act on either petition and Rock Hill was still not incorporated.\n\nThe third, successful petition was made in 1869, only one year after 1868's failed petition. This time there were 57 signers in favor of incorporation, with only seven opponents. The opponents collectively owned 80% of the land that would be incorporated into Rock Hill if the petition was successful. They were unsuccessful at preventing incorporation this time; Rock Hill was officially incorporated on February 26, 1870.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=64}}\n\n===Civil rights movement===\nRock Hill was the setting for two significant events in the [[civil rights movement]]. In February 1961, nine African-American men went to jail at the [[York County, South Carolina|York County]] prison farm after staging a [[sit-in]] at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[McCrory's]] lunch counter in downtown Rock Hill.

The historic [[Catawba Indian Nation]], a traditionally [[Siouan]]-speaking tribe, was here at the time of European encounter.  Currently the only tribe in South Carolina that is federally recognized, its members live near Rock Hill.\n\n===Early colonization===\n\nAlthough some European settlers had already arrived in the Rock Hill area in the 1830s and 1840s, Rock Hill did not become an actual town until the [[Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad]] Company made the decision to send a rail line through the area. Originally, the railroad had hoped to build a station in the nearby village of [[Ebenezer, South Carolina|Ebenezerville]] which was squarely between [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. When approached, however, the locals in Ebenezerville refused to have the railroad run through their village since they considered it dirty and noisy. Instead, engineers and surveyors decided to run the line two miles away by a local landmark. According to some, the engineers marked the spot on the map and named it \"rocky hill.\"<ref name=Willoughby>{{cite book|last=Willoughby|first=Lynn|title=The \"Good Town\" Does Well: Rock Hill, S.C., 1852\u20132002|year=2002|publisher=Written in Stone|location=Orangeburg, South Carolina|isbn=0-9669707-2-1}}</ref>{{RP|page=26}}\n\nSome of Rock Hill's early founding families\u2014the White family, the Black family, and the Moores\u2014believed that having a rail depot so close to them would be advantageous, so they decided to give the Columbia and Charlotte Railroad the right of way through their properties. As the three largest landowners in the area, this settled the matter. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|George Pendleton White]] contracted with the railroad to build a section of the line. Construction began in 1848. The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. A few weeks later, on April 17, 1852, the first Rock Hill Post Office opened.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=26\u201328}}\n\nNow that Rock Hill had a name, a railroad station, and a post office, it began to draw more settlers to the area. Captain J. H. McGinnis built a small general store near the station in 1849 or 1850 to provide supplies for the construction and railroad workers.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|pages=27\u201328}} Templeton Black, who had leased the land to McGinnis, decided to devote some of his other adjacent land to building a larger town. He hired a local surveyor, Squire John Roddey, to organize a main street. Black sold his first plot of land along that street to Ira Ferguson for $125 a few weeks before the post office opened; other businessmen bought plots quickly after that.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\nRock Hill Academy, the first school in Rock Hill, opened in September 1854. Despite its official name, most residents referred to it as the Pine Grove Academy after the pine grove it was located in. [[White House (Rock Hill, South Carolina)#Past Residents|Ann Hutchinson White]], wife of George White, donated the land to the school after her husband's death. The school had 60 male pupils in 1856; a school for girls was later opened in the same place.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=28}}\n\n====Other significant facts and dates====\n* Pre-December 1857: The ''Indian Land Chronicle'', Rock Hill's first newspaper, begins publishing.  After a change in ownership, it was renamed ''The Rock Hill Chronicle'' in 1860.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n* Pre-1860: Rock Hill had at least two doctors: Robert Hervey Hope and William Barron Fewell<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=33}}\n\n===During the American Civil War===\n\nShortly before the [[American Civil War]] began a census had been taken of the population in York County, where Rock Hill is located. Half of the district's 21,800 residents were slaves, integral to local cotton production. The 4,379 white males in the county formed fourteen infantry companies; some of the men joined cavalry or artillery units instead. By the end of the war, 805 of these men were dead, and hundreds more were wounded. Men from Rock Hill and York County were involved in many of the major Civil War battles.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=35}}\n\nDue to its position on the railroad, Rock Hill became a transfer point for Confederate soldiers and supplies moving to and from the front. Since there was no local hospital, townspeople nursed sick and wounded soldiers in their homes. Refugees fleeing the coastal blockade or [[William T. Sherman|General Sherman's]] troops also came to Rock Hill.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}}\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1862, local area farmers switched from cotton to corn in order to produce more food.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=39}} Records show that prices in Rock Hill changed frequently during the war, reflecting both shortages and the inflation of the [[Confederate money|Confederate paper money]].<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}}\n\n[[P. G. T. Beauregard|Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard]] set up a temporary headquarters in Rock Hill on February 21, 1865.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=41}} He ordered the roads to Charlotte blocked to try to prevent General Sherman from reaching the city; Sherman ultimately went in a different direction.\n\nWhen [[Robert E. Lee|General Lee]] surrendered at the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], it was actually a future Rock Hill resident who was responsible for waving the white flag. Captain Robert Moorman Sims, a farmer from Lancaster County, was sent by [[James Longstreet|General James Longstreet]] to inform Union troops that the Confederate troops wanted a truce.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=42}}\n\n===Post-Civil War===\n\nThe Civil War changed the social, economic, and political situation in Rock Hill tremendously, as it did elsewhere in the South.  Rock Hill grew as a town, taking in war refugees, widows and their families, and the return of the men who had left to fight the war.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=58}} The formerly wealthy elite sold off their land to stay afloat financially.  Town life began to become more important than rural life.\n\nMost of the merchants in Rock Hill around 1870 were former Confederate soldiers; many were entrepreneurs who were new to town, trying to start over.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=59}} In 1870, even the largest stores in Rock Hill were only one storey tall, and there were no sidewalks on the roads. The first drug store in Rock Hill opened in the 1870s.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}} A locally contentious bordello was built in 1881 and introduced the town's first paved sidewalk.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=61}}\n\n===Incorporation===\n\nThe town was not officially incorporated until 1870, on the third try.\n\nThe first attempt to get Rock Hill incorporated was made in 1855. A petition, signed by major landholders and businessmen from the Rock Hill area, was presented to the General Assembly on October 19, 1855.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=29}} No action on the matter was taken by the General Assembly.\n\nThe second attempt was in 1868. In their petition, the townspeople claimed that Rock Hill had over 300 residents, \"eleven stores, two churches, two bars, two hotels, two carriage shops, three blacksmith shops, three shoe shops, one tannery, one cabinet shop, and elementary schools for white girls and boys.\" The petition was signed by 48 men, most relative newcomers to Rock Hill, with only a few members of the old, established, landed families. The larger landholders opposed incorporation because of the taxes it would bring.  They filed a counter-proposal which claimed that there were only 100 residents, many of them temporary.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=63}} The situation was a strong indication of the changes Rock Hill experienced as it transitioned from mostly farms to a business community. Ultimately, the state legislature did not act on either petition and Rock Hill was still not incorporated.\n\nThe third, successful petition was made in 1869, only one year after 1868's failed petition. This time there were 57 signers in favor of incorporation, with only seven opponents. The opponents collectively owned 80% of the land that would be incorporated into Rock Hill if the petition was successful. They were unsuccessful at preventing incorporation this time; Rock Hill was officially incorporated on February 26, 1870.<ref name=Willoughby />{{RP|page=64}}\n\n===Civil rights movement===\nRock Hill was the setting for two significant events in the [[civil rights movement]]. In February 1961, nine African-American men went to jail at the [[York County, South Carolina|York County]] prison farm after staging a [[sit-in]] at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[McCrory's]] lunch counter in downtown Rock Hill. The current location is now known as \"Five and Dine\" which has the names of the activists engraved. Their offense was reported to be \"refusing to stop singing hymns during their morning devotions.\" The event gained nationwide attention as the men followed an untried strategy called \"jail, no bail.\"<ref name=\"AP\"/> Rejecting bail was a way to lessen the huge financial burden which civil rights groups were facing as the [[sit-in movement]] spread across the South.<ref name=\"AP\">{{cite news |title=\u2019Sing-In\u2019 Negroes Eat Hearty; Say \u2018Jail\u2014No Bail\u2019 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Spartanburg Herald |date=February 21, 1961 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g3ssAAAAIBAJ&sjid=acwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7405,2802776&dq=rock+hill+sit-in&hl=en |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |quote=Eight Negro Demonstrators in a disciplinary cell at the York County Prison Camp accepted and ate second helpings Monday of the full meal given every third day to prisoners on bread and water. }}</ref> As their actions gained widespread national news coverage, the tactic was adopted by other civil rights groups.

Virginia|1960 ruling]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] outlawing racial segregation in all interstate public facilities. When the civil rights leader [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] and another black man stepped off the bus at Rock Hill, they were beaten by a white mob that was uncontrolled by police. The event drew national attention.\n\nIn 2002, Lewis, by then a US Congressman from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], returned to Rock Hill, where he had been invited as a speaker at [[Winthrop University]] and was given the [[key to the city]]. On January 21, 2008, Rep. Lewis returned to Rock Hill again and spoke at the city's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] holiday observance. Mayor Doug Echols officially apologized to him on the city's behalf for the Freedom Riders' treatment in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Thank you, my brother'|url = http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article12206531.html|website = Heraldonline.com|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref>\n[[File:Group of men and girls working in the Aragon Mill.

The 1973 experimental discovery of weak neutral currents<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haidt, D.|journal=CERN Courier|title=The discovery of the weak neutral currents|year=2004}}[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29168]</ref> (mediated by this Z boson) was one verification of the electroweak unification.\nThe paper by Weinberg in which he presented this theory is one of the most cited works ever in high energy physics.<ref>[[INSPIRE-HEP]]: [http://inspirehep.net/info/hep/stats/topcites/2015/alltime.html Top Cited Articles of All Time (2015 edition)]</ref>\n\nAfter his 1967 seminal work on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, Steven Weinberg continued his work in many aspects of particle physics, quantum field theory, gravity, [[supersymmetry]], [[superstrings]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], as well as a theory called [[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor]].\n\nIn the years after 1967, the full [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle theory was developed through the work of many contributors.  In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973 Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model which did not contain that model's fundamental Higgs boson.\n\nWeinberg became Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1973.\n\nIn 1979 he pioneered the modern view on the [[renormalization]] aspect of quantum field theory that considers all quantum field theories as [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] and changed the viewpoint of previous work (including his own in his 1967 paper) that a sensible quantum field theory must be renormalizable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Physica|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(79)90223-1|pages=327\u2013340|year=1979|title=Phenomenological Lagrangians|volume=96|issue=1\u20132|bibcode = 1979PhyA...96..327W }}</ref> This approach allowed the development of effective theory of quantum gravity,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Donoghue, J.

The 1973 experimental discovery of weak neutral currents<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haidt, D.|journal=CERN Courier|title=The discovery of the weak neutral currents|year=2004}}[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29168]</ref> (mediated by this Z boson) was one verification of the electroweak unification.\nThe paper by Weinberg in which he presented this theory is one of the most cited works ever in high energy physics.<ref>[[INSPIRE-HEP]]: [http://inspirehep.net/info/hep/stats/topcites/2015/alltime.html Top Cited Articles of All Time (2015 edition)]</ref>\n\nAfter his 1967 seminal work on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, Steven Weinberg continued his work in many aspects of particle physics, quantum field theory, gravity, [[supersymmetry]], [[superstrings]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], as well as a theory called [[Technicolor (physics)|Technicolor]].\n\nIn the years after 1967, the full [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle theory was developed through the work of many contributors.  In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973 Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model which did not contain that model's fundamental Higgs boson.\n\nWeinberg became Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1973.\n\nIn 1979 he pioneered the modern view on the [[renormalization]] aspect of quantum field theory that considers all quantum field theories as [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] and changed the viewpoint of previous work (including his own in his 1967 paper) that a sensible quantum field theory must be renormalizable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Physica|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(79)90223-1|pages=327\u2013340|year=1979|title=Phenomenological Lagrangians|volume=96|issue=1\u20132|bibcode = 1979PhyA...96..327W }}</ref> This approach allowed the development of effective theory of quantum gravity,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Donoghue, J.

First found in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], where the name originated in the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] period, the name accounts for about 0.17% of the Spanish population, ranking as the 14th-most frequently found surname in both 1999 and 2004<ref>Mateos & Tucker 2008, OcioTotal 1999</ref> compared to the most popular Spanish surname of those years.\n\n==Variants and related names==\nThere is minor evidence that D\u00edez may be equivalent to D\u00edaz, in the form of Spanish language listing of most frequent surnames in 1999 Spain (OcioTotal 1999). However, a 2008 in-press academic manuscript about Spanish naming in 2004 suggests otherwise, listing statistics for \"D\u00edaz\" and \"D\u00edez\" separately (Mateos & Tucker 2008).<ref>''D\u00edaz'' as being derived from a Gothic form of the paternal [[genitive case|genitive]] of [[Dia (disambiguation)|Dia]], as in \"Dia's child\", or Diag, [[Diago]] or Diego (Dixon 1857).</ref>\n\nThe surname is cognate with the [[Portuguese language]] surname ''Dias''.\n\n==Usage==\n''D\u00edaz'' and the anglicized form ''Diaz'' appear to be surnames only, without evidence for use as given names.  Use of ''Diaz'' may arise through [[Anglicization]] of Portuguese language ''[[Dias (surname)|Dias]]'', as in the case of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].\n\nMany examples of the surnames ''D\u00edaz'' exist among historically notable people as a patronymic of Diego.  Among the earliest such examples is [[El Cid]], whose real name was ''Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar'', and whose father's given name was ''Diego'' (Catholic Encyclopedia 1913).\n\nThere is at least one instance of use as a single name, the former Norwegian rap artist [[Diaz (musician)|Diaz]], who was born to a Spanish father and Norwegian mother; his birth name was \"Andr\u00e9s Rafael D\u00edaz\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==Geographical distribution==\nAs of 2014, 21.5% of all known bearers of the surname ''D\u00edaz'' were residents of [[Mexico]] (frequency 1:132), 11.4% of [[Colombia]] (1:96), 9.1% of [[Argentina]] (1:108), 8.0% of [[Spain]] (1:134), 7.2% of [[Venezuela]] (1:96), 6.7% of the [[United States]] (1:1,242), 5.2% of [[Peru]] (1:142), 5.0% of [[Cuba]] (1:53), 4.6% of [[Chile]] (1:87), 3.1% of the [[Philippines]] (1:742), 2.9% of the [[Dominican Republic]] (1:83), 2.5% of [[Puerto Rico]] (1:33), 2.4% of [[Guatemala]] (1:155), 2.0% of [[Honduras]] (1:100), 1.4% of [[El Salvador]] (1:107), 1.3% of [[Nicaragua]] (1:103), 1.2% of [[Ecuador]] (1:293) and 1.0% of [[Paraguay]] (1:161).\n\nIn [[Spain]], the frequency of the surname was higher than national average (1:134) in the following autonomous communities:\n* 1.

First found in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], where the name originated in the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] period, the name accounts for about 0.17% of the Spanish population, ranking as the 14th-most frequently found surname in both 1999 and 2004<ref>Mateos & Tucker 2008, OcioTotal 1999</ref> compared to the most popular Spanish surname of those years.\n\n==Variants and related names==\nThere is minor evidence that D\u00edez may be equivalent to D\u00edaz, in the form of Spanish language listing of most frequent surnames in 1999 Spain (OcioTotal 1999). However, a 2008 in-press academic manuscript about Spanish naming in 2004 suggests otherwise, listing statistics for \"D\u00edaz\" and \"D\u00edez\" separately (Mateos & Tucker 2008).<ref>''D\u00edaz'' as being derived from a Gothic form of the paternal [[genitive case|genitive]] of [[Dia (disambiguation)|Dia]], as in \"Dia's child\", or Diag, [[Diago]] or Diego (Dixon 1857).</ref>\n\nThe surname is cognate with the [[Portuguese language]] surname ''Dias''.\n\n==Usage==\n''D\u00edaz'' and the anglicized form ''Diaz'' appear to be surnames only, without evidence for use as given names.  Use of ''Diaz'' may arise through [[Anglicization]] of Portuguese language ''[[Dias (surname)|Dias]]'', as in the case of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].\n\nMany examples of the surnames ''D\u00edaz'' exist among historically notable people as a patronymic of Diego.  Among the earliest such examples is [[El Cid]], whose real name was ''Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar'', and whose father's given name was ''Diego'' (Catholic Encyclopedia 1913).\n\nThere is at least one instance of use as a single name, the former Norwegian rap artist [[Diaz (musician)|Diaz]], who was born to a Spanish father and Norwegian mother; his birth name was \"Andr\u00e9s Rafael D\u00edaz\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==Geographical distribution==\nAs of 2014, 21.5% of all known bearers of the surname ''D\u00edaz'' were residents of [[Mexico]] (frequency 1:132), 11.4% of [[Colombia]] (1:96), 9.1% of [[Argentina]] (1:108), 8.0% of [[Spain]] (1:134), 7.2% of [[Venezuela]] (1:96), 6.7% of the [[United States]] (1:1,242), 5.2% of [[Peru]] (1:142), 5.0% of [[Cuba]] (1:53), 4.6% of [[Chile]] (1:87), 3.1% of the [[Philippines]] (1:742), 2.9% of the [[Dominican Republic]] (1:83), 2.5% of [[Puerto Rico]] (1:33), 2.4% of [[Guatemala]] (1:155), 2.0% of [[Honduras]] (1:100), 1.4% of [[El Salvador]] (1:107), 1.3% of [[Nicaragua]] (1:103), 1.2% of [[Ecuador]] (1:293) and 1.0% of [[Paraguay]] (1:161).\n\nIn [[Spain]], the frequency of the surname was higher than national average (1:134) in the following autonomous communities:\n* 1.

Then he was called to military duty in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]] as a lieutenant. On 8 September 1943, on the date of the [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]], he refused to remain in the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italian Social Republic]], and took refuge in [[Abruzzo]], in [[Scanno, Italy|Scanno]]. He subsequently managed to pass the lines and reach [[Bari]], where he joined the [[Partito d'Azione]] (and thus the [[Italian resistance movement]]).\n\nIn 1946 he married Franca Pilla. That same year, he obtained a B.A. in law from the [[University of Pisa]] and began working at the [[Bank of Italy|Banca d'Italia]]. He also joined the [[CGIL]] (Trade Union), which he left in 1980.\n\n===Bank of Italy===\nIn 1960, he was called to work in the central administration of the [[Bank of Italy|Bank of Italy]], where he became Secretary General in 1973, Vice Director General in 1976, and Director General in 1978. In October 1979, he was nominated Governor of the Bank of Italy and President of the national Bureau de Change, positions he filled until 1993.\n\n===Political career===\nCiampi was the first non-parliamentarian prime minister of Italy in more than 100 years.<ref name=went28apr>{{cite news|last=Wentworth|first=Richard L.|title=Italy Turns to a Banker to Form Government|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0428/28071.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=28 April 1993}}</ref> From April 1993 to May 1994 he oversaw a [[technical government]]. Later, as treasury minister from 1996 to May 1999 in the governments of [[Romano Prodi]] and [[Massimo D'Alema]], he was credited with adopting the euro currency. He personally chose the Italian design for the 1-euro coin, whereas all others were left to a television vote among some candidates the ministry had prepared (see also: [[Italian euro coins]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nCiampi chose the [[Vitruvian man]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the symbolic grounds that it represented man as a measure of all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] material of the coin.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Presidency and afterward==\n[[File:20050407-2 wf1g6022jas-1-515h.jpg|thumb|right|Ciampi meets U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] at the Quirinale Palace, 7 April 2005]]\nCiampi was elected with a broad majority, and was the second president ever to be elected at the first ballot (when there is a requirement of a two-thirds majority) in a joint session of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[Italian Senate]] and representatives of the Regions.\n\nHe usually refrained from intervening directly into the political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently stressed the need for all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President \u2013 the so-called ''Ciampi-bis'' \u2013 was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before [[2006 Italian presidential election|his mandate expired]]. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, [[Giorgio Napolitano]].\n\nAs President, Ciampi was not considered to be close to the positions of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternance after the devout [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. He often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling in Italy because of its abuse by the fascist regime.\n\nHe died in Rome on 16 September 2016 at the age of 95.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-former-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-aged-95-1474023277 Italy's former President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies aged 95] Wall Street

He was the [[List of prime ministers of Italy|49th Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1993 to 1994 and was the tenth [[President of Italy]] from 1999 to 2006.\n\n==Biography==\n===Education===\nCiampi was born in [[Livorno]] ([[Province of Livorno]]).<ref name=Sen>[http://www.senato.it/leg/15/BGT/Schede/Attsen/00000594.htm Page at Senate website] {{in lang|it}}.</ref>\n\nHe received a B.A. in [[ancient Greek literature]] and [[classical philology]] in 1941 from the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], one of the country's most prestigious universities, defending a thesis entitled ''[[Favorinus|Favorino]] d'[[Arles|Arelate]] e la consolazione \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2''<ref>''Favorinus of Arles and the Consolation \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2'', anastatic reprint by the Scuola Normale di Pisa editions, editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Franco Montanari|it|3=Franco Montanari|vertical-align=sup}}, introduction of [[Salvatore Settis]], {{ISBN|978-88-7642-411-3}}.</ref> under the direction of the Hellenist [[Augusto Mancini]]. Then he was called to military duty in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]] as a lieutenant. On 8 September 1943, on the date of the [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]], he refused to remain in the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italian Social Republic]], and took refuge in [[Abruzzo]], in [[Scanno, Italy|Scanno]]. He subsequently managed to pass the lines and reach [[Bari]], where he joined the [[Partito d'Azione]] (and thus the [[Italian resistance movement]]).\n\nIn 1946 he married Franca Pilla. That same year, he obtained a B.A. in law from the [[University of Pisa]] and began working at the [[Bank of Italy|Banca d'Italia]]. He also joined the [[CGIL]] (Trade Union), which he left in 1980.\n\n===Bank of Italy===\nIn 1960, he was called to work in the central administration of the [[Bank of Italy|Bank of Italy]], where he became Secretary General in 1973, Vice Director General in 1976, and Director General in 1978. In October 1979, he was nominated Governor of the Bank of Italy and President of the national Bureau de Change, positions he filled until 1993.\n\n===Political career===\nCiampi was the first non-parliamentarian prime minister of Italy in more than 100 years.<ref name=went28apr>{{cite news|last=Wentworth|first=Richard L.|title=Italy Turns to a Banker to Form Government|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0428/28071.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=28 April 1993}}</ref> From April 1993 to May 1994 he oversaw a [[technical government]]. Later, as treasury minister from 1996 to May 1999 in the governments of [[Romano Prodi]] and [[Massimo D'Alema]], he was credited with adopting the euro currency. He personally chose the Italian design for the 1-euro coin, whereas all others were left to a television vote among some candidates the ministry had prepared (see also: [[Italian euro coins]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nCiampi chose the [[Vitruvian man]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the symbolic grounds that it represented man as a measure of all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] material of the coin.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Presidency and afterward==\n[[File:20050407-2 wf1g6022jas-1-515h.jpg|thumb|right|Ciampi meets U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] at the Quirinale Palace, April 7, 2005]]\nCiampi was elected with a broad majority, and was the second president ever to be elected at the first ballot (when there is a requirement of a two-thirds majority) in a joint session of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[Italian Senate]] and representatives of the Regions.\n\nHe usually refrained from intervening directly into the political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently stressed the need for all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President \u2013 the so-called ''Ciampi-bis'' \u2013 was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before [[2006 Italian presidential election|his mandate expired]]. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, [[Giorgio Napolitano]].\n\nAs President, Ciampi was not considered to be close to the positions of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternance after the devout [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. He often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling in Italy because of its abuse by the fascist regime.\n\nHe died in Rome on 16 September 2016 at the age of 95.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-former-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-aged-95-1474023277 Italy's former President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies aged 95] Wall Street Journal</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/former-italian-president-carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dies-at-95 Former Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dies at 95] The Guardian</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/world/europe/carlo-azeglio-ciampi-dead.html|title=Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Former Italian Prime Minister, Dies at 95|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 September 2016|access-date=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nAs President of the Italian Republic between 18 May 1999 and 15 May 2006, Ciampi held the roles of:\n*Head of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]\n*Chief of the [[Military Order of Italy]]\n*Head of the [[Order of Merit for Labour]]\n*Head of the [[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity]]\n*Head of the [[Order of Vittorio Veneto]]\n*Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]\n*Collar of the [[Order of Pius IX]] (Papal Order)\n*1982: Great Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]\n*1985: Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] (France)\n*1986: Great Cross of [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n*1991: Honorary degree, [[University of Pavia]]\n*1993: Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (Japan)\n*1995: Freeman of the City of [[Naples]]\n*1999: Collar of the [[Order of the White Rose]] (Finland)\n*2000: [[Gold Medal of the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe]]\n*2000: Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (United Kingdom, 16 October 2000)\n*2000: {{flagicon|Poland}} Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (Poland)\n*2001: Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]]\n*2001: Grand Cross of the [[Grand Order of King Tomislav]] (\"For outstanding contribution to the promotion of friendship and development co-operation between the Republic of Croatia and the Italian Republic.\" \u2013 Croatia, 19 October 2001)\n*2001: Honorary doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]] Faculty of Economics\n*2002: Grand Star of Honour for [[Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria|Services to the Republic of Austria]]\n*2002: {{flagicon|Slovakia}} -
