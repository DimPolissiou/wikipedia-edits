In this context, Bohemians may or may not be [[Nomadism|wanderers]], [[adventurer]]s, or [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]].\n\nThis use of the word bohemian first appeared in the English language in the 19th century to describe the non-traditional lifestyles of [[marginalized]] and impoverished artists, writers, journalists, musicians, and actors in major European cities.<ref>First occurrence in this sense in English, 1848 (''[[OED]]'').</ref>\n\nBohemians were associated with unorthodox or [[anti-establishment]] political or social viewpoints, which often were expressed through [[free love]], [[frugality]], and\u2014in some cases\u2014[[simple living]] or [[voluntary poverty]].

Use of the French and English terms  to refer to the Romani is now old-fashioned and archaic, respectively, and both the French and English terms carry a connotation of [[Western esotericism|arcane]] enlightenment (and are considered antonyms of the word [[Philistinism|philistine]]) and the less frequently intended, pejorative connotation of carelessness about personal hygiene and marital fidelity.\n\nThe title character in ''[[Carmen]]'' (1876), a French opera set in the Spanish city of [[Seville]], is referred to as a \"boh\u00e9mienne\" in Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy's libretto.

Public perceptions of the alternative lifestyles supposedly led by artists were further molded by [[George du Maurier]]'s romanticized best-selling novel of Bohemian culture ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' (1894). The novel outlines the fortunes of three [[expatriate]] English artists, their Irish model, and two colourful [[Central Europe]]an musicians, in the artist quarter of Paris.\n\nIn Spanish literature, the Bohemian impulse can be seen in [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n]]'s play ''[[Luces de Bohemia]]'', published in 1920.\n\nIn his song [[La Boh\u00e8me (Charles Aznavour song)|La Boh\u00e8me]], [[Charles Aznavour]] described the Bohemian lifestyle in [[Montmartre]].
