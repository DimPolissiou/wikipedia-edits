It is capable of comparing multiple files in different file types simultaneously. File types supported include Word ([[DOC (computing)|DOC]], [[Office Open XML|DOCx]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]]), [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Text file|TXT]], [[Adobe Illustrator|AI]], [[Hangul (word processor)|HWP]] (Hangul) and [[XML]] ([[Structured Product Labeling|SPL]] files required by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] [<nowiki/>[[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]] in the USA).

It compares, for example, the original manuscript with the artwork to be printed, or any two or more documents, and indicates all deviations in text and graphic content between the compared documents. Deviations are clearly marked and include, among others, deviations in spelling, font, formatting, style, type size,  order of words and paragraphs, and missing text and graphics. TVT uses the [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/library.html PDF library] for processing [[PDF]] documents. Deviations and corrections can be saved as a [[PDF]].
