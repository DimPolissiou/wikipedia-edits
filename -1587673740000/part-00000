Written for the screen by Norman Katkov, it was an adaptation of Katkov's own [[novel]] which, in turn, was inspired by the 1932 [[Massie Trial]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. It was typical of many [[crime drama]]s produced during the period.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1937 [[Hawaii]], four native Hawaiian men find a white woman, beaten nearly to death, and take her to a hospital\u2014only to be charged later with her rape and assault. During their trial, the woman's husband, a [[lieutenant]] in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], fatally shoots one of them and later stands trial himself. The trial brings into stark relief the racial tensions that tear at the social fabric of Territorial Hawaii in the years prior to [[World War II]].\n\n[[Socialite]] Hester Ashley Murdoch ([[Madeleine Stowe]]) leaves an officers' dinner party at the US Naval base in [[Honolulu]] in the company of a man who is not her husband (Lieutenant Lloyd Murdoch, played by [[William Russ]]), but rather Lt. Murdoch's best friend. The friend coldly announces that he is terminating their relationship, though Hester is carrying his child. Outraged, she announces that she will tell her husband and the commanding admiral on the station. In retaliation, the friend beats her savagely and leaves her bloodied and battered where she lies.\n\nFour young Hawaiian men find her and take her to a hospital, although they fear being blamed for the condition she is in because she is ''[[haole]]'' (white) and they are native Hawaiian. At the hospital, Hester's mother Doris ([[Jane Alexander]]) assumes that the Hawaiians are to blame, but Hester says, \"It's nobody's fault; I was the pregnant one!\" The shocked Doris tells her daughter that she must collaborate in Doris' campaign to blame the Hawaiians, saying that Hester must think of Doris' \"position\" in [[upper class|high society]]. Accordingly, the four are charged with rape and assault, although the only sexual intercourse that Hester had was consensual and not with any of the four.\n\nMost of the law-enforcement officers involved, including the [[Honolulu Police Department]] and the Navy [[Shore Patrol]], assume that the Hawaiians are guilty, but Detective Captain Curt Maddox ([[Kris Kristofferson]]) is unconvinced. Meanwhile, the Hawaiians get a court-appointed attorney who strives valiantly to show that the four must be innocent of the crime, because of time-line conflicts with the best estimate of when the beating took place.\nThe trial of the four ends abruptly and tragically, though, when Lieutenant Murdoch, at the height of an at-the-bench discussion between the judge and the two opposing counsels, abruptly draws his service automatic and shoots the lead defendant twice in the head, killing him.\n\nNow Murdoch must stand trial (in a civilian court) for murder in the first degree. Doris sends a wire to famed criminal attorney Walter Bergmann ([[Jose Ferrer]]), who agrees to defend Lieutenant Murdoch against the murder charge. The pretrial investigation is complicated by an affair between Detective Maddox and Mr. Bergmann's wife Leonore ([[Sean Young]]).\n\nThe case is further complicated when a number of Navy petty officers, all friends of Murdoch, kidnap the three remaining Hawaiians, tie them in spread-eagle fashion to an improvised rack, and beat them to get them to confess to the original alleged rape and assault. In the course of that particular atrocity, the Navy men repeatedly use the expression \"bilge\", which (at least according to the film) is common Navy slang for useless information or known falsehood. The lawyer for the Hawaiians interviews the three, after they are brought to a hospital and unable to lie on their backs because of the severe beatings they have received. There, they finally blurt out, \"They said, 'Bilge!'\" This gives the lawyer the vital clues he needs. Maddox follows up the clues and has the three arrested.\n\nMurdoch's trial climaxes with Attorney Bergmann trying to sum up by saying that Murdoch's action was excusable. \"Those animals beat her!\" he cries; then Hester, plagued by her conscience, blurts out, \"They're innocent! They're innocent!\" Although Bergmann roughly escorts her from the courtroom, the damage is done: Murdoch is convicted.\n\nSubsequently, Doris engages in a behavior called \"brazening it out\". She hires an interior decorator to redecorate her home. In the middle of her interview with the decorator, Detective Maddox arrives with a warrant for the arrests of Doris and Hester. Hester, crushed, rushes to her bathroom and hangs herself from the shower head. Doris discovers Hester's dead body and cries out in anguish, although whether that anguish is truly for losing her daughter or because this is the final shameful and devastating blow to her social position, the film leaves unresolved, perhaps deliberately so.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Detective Captain Curtis \"Curt\" Maddox, HPD\n* [[Jane Alexander]] as Doris Ashley\n* [[Sean Young]] as Leonore Bergmann (Walter Bergmann's wife)\n* [[Jose Ferrer]] as Walter Bergmann, counsellor-at-law\n* [[Susan Blakely]] as Marie Farrell\n* [[David Clennon]] as Philip Murray\n* [[George Coe]] as Dr. Lansing (who examines Hester)\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Harvey Koster\n* [[Elizabeth Lindsey]] as Sarah\n* [[Haunani Minne]] as Princess Luahine (presumably a member of the deposed royal house of Hawaii, she breaks her self-imposed isolation to take up the cause of the four Hawaiians who are so ill-used by the ''haole'' community)\n* [[William Russ]] as [[Lieutenant]] Lloyd Murdoch [[United States Navy|USN]]\n* [[James Saito]] as Halehone (the Hawaiian lawyer who represents the accused men)\n* [[Matt Salinger]] as Bryce Parker\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Hester Ashley Murdoch (Lloyd's wife)\n* [[Arthur Rosenberg (actor)|Arthur Rosenberg]] as Sergeant Jack Keller\n* [[Sandy McPeak]] as [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Glenn Langon, USN, (the [[14th Naval District]] commandant)\n\n== Reception ==\nThis film was nominated for two awards, including one [[Emmy Award]] for costuming and an [[Artios Award]] for casting.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0090749|title=Blood & Orchids}}\n*{{Amg movie|124071|title=Blood & Orchids}}\n*[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Oct/14/op/op03a.html The Massie Case: Injustice and Courage (Honolulu Advertiser)]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/massie/index.html ''The Massie Affair'' at PBS' The American Experience]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood and Orchids}}\n[[Category:1986 television films]]\n[[Category:1986 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American courtroom films]]\n[[Category:Crime films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Snow]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1937]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:Hoaxes in fiction]]\n[[Category:Suicide in film]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Navy]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1986 television film directed by Jerry Thorpe}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name           = Blood & Orchids\n| image          =\n| image_size     =\n| genre          = Drama\n| director       = [[Jerry Thorpe]]\n| executive_producer = Malcolm Stuart\n| producer       = [[Andrew Adelson]]<br />[[Kim C.

Therefore, the defence system of North Macedonia is based on the determination to give resistance by use of an armed force against any possible aggression and for a defensive combat on the whole territory. For that purpose, the defence system is responsible to provide conditions so that all of the state authorities and institutions function and conditions for joining the collective defence and security systems as a protection of the independence and sovereignty are provided.\n\nNorth Macedonia could maintain all the guarantees for its security through the collective defence and security systems. That is why North Macedonia supports the reinforcement of these collective systems and determines itself to actively participate in these systems and to cooperate with regard to the construction of the new European security architecture based upon NATO, OSCE and WEU.\n\nTo fulfill these principles and strategic goals, the defence system of North Macedonia is a completed with the peacetime and warfare organisation, the basic development goals, the preparations and the use of the Armed Forces as well as the full civilian control over the Armed Forces. The defence system comprises the whole defence potential of the country: civilians, state authorities, civil protection forces, local self-management, public institutions and services and enterprises of special significance for the defence.\n\nThe preparations for a successful defence are conducted during peacetime. These include preparations of the state authorities; preparations and training of the Armed Forces and their deployment on the territory of North Macedonia; preparation of the public institutions and the local self-management; preparations of the civil population and participation in joint exercises and other forms of co-operation with the PfP and NATO member countries.\n\nNational Command Management\n\nThe management and the procedures in the field of defence of North Macedonia are defined by the Constitution, the Defence Law and by the responsibilities of the executive and judicial authorities.\n\nThe commanding with the Armed Forces is based upon the uniformity in command when using the forces and the resources, and the responsibility to execute the decisions and the orders of the one that is superior in command.\n\n*The President of the Republic is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n'''The President'''  passes the defence plan and strategy, the decisions for readiness conducting, organisation and formation structure of the Army, passes documents on development, decision on mobilization etc.\n\n'''The President'''  at the same time is the Chairman of the Security Council of North Macedonia. The Security Council considers all the defence and security related issues of North Macedonia and makes recommendations to the Parliament and to the Government.\n\n'''The Parliament of North Macedonia''' supervises the competence of the Government with regard to the defence, it passes decisions on the existing of a direct threat from a war, declares warfare situation and peace and passes the defence budget.\n\nThe Parliamentary Interior Policy and Defence Commission has similar responsibilities.\n\n'''The Government of North Macedonia'''  has the following responsibilities: proposes the defence plan, the defence budget etc.\n\n'''The Ministry of Defence'''  develops the defence strategy and works out the assessment of the possible threats and risks. The MOD is also responsible for the defence system, training, readiness of the Armed Forces, the equipment and the development and it proposes the defence budget, etc.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nIn 2008, the Macedonian army had roughly 8,000 soldiers.\n\n=== War in Afghanistan ===\n[[File:ISAF-Logo.svg|thumb|ISAF logo]]\n[[File:Macedonian Soldiers in Kabul.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian soldiers in Kabul]]\nThe then-Republic of Macedonia began its participation in the [[NATO]]-led [[ISAF]] operation in August 2002, with the allocation of two officers to the Turkish contingent. On 8 September, independence day of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian flag was flown for the first time in Kabul. In March 2003, the Army of the Republic of Macedonia increased its contribution in the ISAF mission by sending one section from the 2nd Infantry Brigade as part of the German contingent. As a result of the successful execution of the mission and the high marks received for participation in ISAF, from August 2004 until the end of 2006, the ARM participated with one mechanized infantry platoon from the Leopard unit. At the same time, in August 2005 medical personnel was sent in ISAF as part of the Combined Medical Team in the A3 format (Macedonia, Albania, Croatia), which successfully carried out tasks at the Kabul airport, firstly in the composition of the Greek Field Hospital, and later in the composition of the Czech Field Hospital.\n\nBased on the assessments of the Alliance in the part of the declared units from the ARM, which achieved the required strict standards in the field of training and operational procedures, and in line with the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC), the ARM in June 2006 sent also one mechanized infantry company, part of the first mechanized infantry brigade, in the composition of the British contingent in ISAF. The trust shown from the United Kingdom towards the ninety \"Scorpions\" from the first infantry brigade, was justified in full.\n\nThe high marks from the highest command structures for the work of the unit as well as the learned lessons are only an imperative for continuing the successful mission. In the second rotation of the company for securing the ISAF command, the Republic of Macedonia increased the participation from ninety to one hundred and twenty seven participants, and from January 2008 it sent three staff officers in the ISAF Command in Kabul.\n\nAs a support to the efforts for self-sustainability of the Afghanistan National Army (ANA), beginning from March 2008, the Republic of Macedonia sent two soldiers (one officer and one NCO) as part of the Combined Multinational [[Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team]] (OMLT) in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] while, beginning from December 2008, in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway, a Macedonian medical team is included through one Surgical team in the organizational structure of the surgical unit of the Norwegian Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Meymanah, Afghanistan.\n\n=== EUFOR Althea ===\n[[File:Macedonian Air Force Mi-17.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian Mi-8 in EUFOR Althea Mission in BiH]]\n\nNorth Macedonia has reaffirmed its strategic commitment for attaining membership to the EU by its resolute political commitment to support the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CSFP) and by declaring a concrete contribution to the civilian and military operations in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).\nThe participation of the then-Republic of Macedonia in the EU crisis management military operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina marked the first in the series of concrete and substantial contributions that the country provided in the framework of the civilian and military CSDP operations aimed at enhancing the EU capacities.\nThe Agreement with the EU for its participation in Althea was signed on 3 July 2006, in Brussels. The contribution of the Republic of Macedonia to the EU operation Althea has confirmed its progress from a consumer of the first EU military operation (Concordia 2003) into an active contributor to the CSDP (Althea 2006).\nThe country's first contribution to an EU-led operation began in July 2006, by declaring a helicopter detachment, consisting of two Mi-8/17 helicopters and 21crew.\nIn November 2006, the Republic of Macedonia enhanced its own contribution to the EU operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a medical team composed of 10 personnel for providing Role 1 medical support in Camp Butmir.\n\n=== Iraq War ===\n[[File:Macedonian soldiers practice reflexive fire skills at Camp Taji, Iraq (April 2008).jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian soldiers in 2008 during the Iraq War]]\n[[File:Soldiers say goodbye to Macedonian friends DVIDS97161.jpg|thumb|A Macedonian soldier saluting during a performance of the Macedonian national anthem in 2008]]\nWith the political consensus of all political entities in the RM as well as the overall Macedonian public in terms of the support of the Coalition in the \"fight against terrorism\", the Republic of Macedonia took active participation by sending its units in the Iraqi Freedom Mission. Based on all legal authorizations, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted decisions for sending its units to the Iraqi Freedom Mission in the period between June 2003 and December 2008 for each mission separately every 6 months during the term of the mission. The Mission started by sending two officers in the US Central Command in Tampa, in March 2003. Upon the completion of the major combat operations, the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime, and the adoption of Resolution 1546 of the United Nations Security Council, in June 2003 on sending a special task platoon that executed the tasks as part of the 4th infantry division of the Multi-National Force Iraq. In 2008, participation in the Iraqi Freedom Mission was increased by an additional platoon. A total of 11 rotations were conducted between June 2003 and December 2008. The eleventh rotation was the last, which completed participation in the Iraqi Mission. The overall number of personnel that participated in this mission is 490.\n\n=== Support for KFOR ===\n\nHaving in mind the priorities in the part of logistics not only in national terms, but even more in proportion with the requirements and requests of the Alliance, the Host Nation Support Coordination Centre began to work in April 2005 as part of the NATO HQ in Skopje, a project implemented for the first time with a member nation from the Partnership for Peace. The project at the beginning was implemented on proposal of General Blease, who at that time was the Commander of NATO forces in Skopje. At the beginning, the project included 11 officers from the ARM, who successfully completed the training for the obligations related to giving support from the host nation. Promoting the personal professionalism and achievements, in 2006 these officers became the basis of the Coordination Centre, which gradually began the preparations for undertaking the tasks for support to KFOR.\n\nIn June 2007, having in mind the large meaning and the projected goals, the Coordination Centre was included in the formation of the Logistics Support Command in the General Staff of the ARM. In this manner as an addition to the participation in the mission in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lebanon, the ARM participates also in the mission for support to Kosovo.\n\n=== UNIFIL ===\nMacedonia participated in the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations in Lebanon, UNIFIL.\n\nThe security and prosperity in global terms depend more and more on the effective multilateral system. The strategic partnership with the Organization of the United Nations, whose Treaty represents the fundamental framework of the international relations, are the priority of the European Union and NATO on the international security scene. Hence, the contribution of the Republic of Macedonia in the military part with respect to the missions led by the Organization of the United National is a confirmation of the effective membership of the Republic of Macedonia in the Organization and its strategic determinations.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThe primary arm of the military in North Macedonia is the Army of the Republic of North Macedonia (APCM); it is commanded by the [[Minister of Defense (North Macedonia)|Minister of Defense]] through the Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]] (CGS).

Therefore, the defence system of North Macedonia is based on the determination to give resistance by use of an armed force against any possible aggression and for a defensive combat on the whole territory. For that purpose, the defence system is responsible to provide conditions so that all of the state authorities and institutions function and conditions for joining the collective defence and security systems as a protection of the independence and sovereignty are provided.\n\nNorth Macedonia could maintain all the guarantees for its security through the collective defence and security systems. That is why North Macedonia supports the reinforcement of these collective systems and determines itself to actively participate in these systems and to cooperate with regard to the construction of the new European security architecture based upon NATO, OSCE and WEU.\n\nTo fulfill these principles and strategic goals, the defence system of North Macedonia is a completed with the peacetime and warfare organisation, the basic development goals, the preparations and the use of the Armed Forces as well as the full civilian control over the Armed Forces. The defence system comprises the whole defence potential of the country: civilians, state authorities, civil protection forces, local self-management, public institutions and services and enterprises of special significance for the defence.\n\nThe preparations for a successful defence are conducted during peacetime. These include preparations of the state authorities; preparations and training of the Armed Forces and their deployment on the territory of North Macedonia; preparation of the public institutions and the local self-management; preparations of the civil population and participation in joint exercises and other forms of co-operation with the PfP and NATO member countries.\n\nNational Command Management\n\nThe management and the procedures in the field of defence of North Macedonia are defined by the Constitution, the Defence Law and by the responsibilities of the executive and judicial authorities.\n\nThe commanding with the Armed Forces is based upon the uniformity in command when using the forces and the resources, and the responsibility to execute the decisions and the orders of the one that is superior in command.\n\n*The President of the Republic is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n'''The President'''  passes the defence plan and strategy, the decisions for readiness conducting, organisation and formation structure of the Army, passes documents on development, decision on mobilization etc.\n\n'''The President'''  at the same time is the Chairman of the Security Council of North Macedonia. The Security Council considers all the defence and security related issues of North Macedonia and makes recommendations to the Parliament and to the Government.\n\n'''The Parliament of North Macedonia''' supervises the competence of the Government with regard to the defence, it passes decisions on the existing of a direct threat from a war, declares warfare situation and peace and passes the defence budget.\n\nThe Parliamentary Interior Policy and Defence Commission has similar responsibilities.\n\n'''The Government of North Macedonia'''  has the following responsibilities: proposes the defence plan, the defence budget etc.\n\n'''The Ministry of Defence'''  develops the defence strategy and works out the assessment of the possible threats and risks. The MOD is also responsible for the defence system, training, readiness of the Armed Forces, the equipment and the development and it proposes the defence budget, etc.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nIn 2008, the Macedonian army had roughly 8,000 soldiers.\n\n=== War in Afghanistan ===\n[[File:ISAF-Logo.svg|thumb|ISAF logo]]\n[[File:Macedonian Soldiers in Kabul.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian soldiers in Kabul]]\nThe then-Republic of Macedonia began its participation in the [[NATO]]-led [[ISAF]] operation in August 2002, with the allocation of two officers to the Turkish contingent. On 8 September, independence day of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian flag was flown for the first time in Kabul. In March 2003, the Army of the Republic of Macedonia increased its contribution in the ISAF mission by sending one section from the 2nd Infantry Brigade as part of the German contingent. As a result of the successful execution of the mission and the high marks received for participation in ISAF, from August 2004 until the end of 2006, the ARM participated with one mechanized infantry platoon from the Leopard unit. At the same time, in August 2005 medical personnel was sent in ISAF as part of the Combined Medical Team in the A3 format (Macedonia, Albania, Croatia), which successfully carried out tasks at the Kabul airport, firstly in the composition of the Greek Field Hospital, and later in the composition of the Czech Field Hospital.\n\nBased on the assessments of the Alliance in the part of the declared units from the ARM, which achieved the required strict standards in the field of training and operational procedures, and in line with the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC), the ARM in June 2006 sent also one mechanized infantry company, part of the first mechanized infantry brigade, in the composition of the British contingent in ISAF. The trust shown from the United Kingdom towards the ninety \"Scorpions\" from the first infantry brigade, was justified in full.\n\nThe high marks from the highest command structures for the work of the unit as well as the learned lessons are only an imperative for continuing the successful mission. In the second rotation of the company for securing the ISAF command, the Republic of Macedonia increased the participation from ninety to one hundred and twenty seven participants, and from January 2008 it sent three staff officers in the ISAF Command in Kabul.\n\nAs a support to the efforts for self-sustainability of the Afghanistan National Army (ANA), beginning from March 2008, the Republic of Macedonia sent two soldiers (one officer and one NCO) as part of the Combined Multinational [[Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team]] (OMLT) in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] while, beginning from December 2008, in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway, a Macedonian medical team is included through one Surgical team in the organizational structure of the surgical unit of the Norwegian Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Meymanah, Afghanistan.\n\n=== EUFOR Althea ===\n[[File:Macedonian Air Force Mi-17.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian Mi-8 in EUFOR Althea Mission in BiH]]\n\nNorth Macedonia has reaffirmed its strategic commitment for attaining membership to the EU by its resolute political commitment to support the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CSFP) and by declaring a concrete contribution to the civilian and military operations in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).\nThe participation of the then-Republic of Macedonia in the EU crisis management military operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina marked the first in the series of concrete and substantial contributions that the country provided in the framework of the civilian and military CSDP operations aimed at enhancing the EU capacities.\nThe Agreement with the EU for its participation in Althea was signed on 3 July 2006, in Brussels. The contribution of the Republic of Macedonia to the EU operation Althea has confirmed its progress from a consumer of the first EU military operation (Concordia 2003) into an active contributor to the CSDP (Althea 2006).\nThe country's first contribution to an EU-led operation began in July 2006, by declaring a helicopter detachment, consisting of two Mi-8/17 helicopters and 21crew.\nIn November 2006, the Republic of Macedonia enhanced its own contribution to the EU operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a medical team composed of 10 personnel for providing Role 1 medical support in Camp Butmir.\n\n=== Iraq War ===\n[[File:Macedonian soldiers practice reflexive fire skills at Camp Taji, Iraq (April 2008).jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian soldiers in 2008 during the Iraq War]]\n[[File:Soldiers say goodbye to Macedonian friends DVIDS97161.jpg|thumb|A Macedonian soldier saluting during a performance of the Macedonian national anthem in 2008]]\nWith the political consensus of all political entities in the RM as well as the overall Macedonian public in terms of the support of the Coalition in the \"fight against terrorism\", the Republic of Macedonia took active participation by sending its units in the Iraqi Freedom Mission. Based on all legal authorizations, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted decisions for sending its units to the Iraqi Freedom Mission in the period between June 2003 and December 2008 for each mission separately every 6 months during the term of the mission. The Mission started by sending two officers in the US Central Command in Tampa, in March 2003. Upon the completion of the major combat operations, the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime, and the adoption of Resolution 1546 of the United Nations Security Council, in June 2003 on sending a special task platoon that executed the tasks as part of the 4th infantry division of the Multi-National Force Iraq. In 2008, participation in the Iraqi Freedom Mission was increased by an additional platoon. A total of 11 rotations were conducted between June 2003 and December 2008. The eleventh rotation was the last, which completed participation in the Iraqi Mission. The overall number of personnel that participated in this mission is 490.\n\n=== Support for KFOR ===\n\nHaving in mind the priorities in the part of logistics not only in national terms, but even more in proportion with the requirements and requests of the Alliance, the Host Nation Support Coordination Centre began to work in April 2005 as part of the NATO HQ in Skopje, a project implemented for the first time with a member nation from the Partnership for Peace. The project at the beginning was implemented on proposal of General Blease, who at that time was the Commander of NATO forces in Skopje. At the beginning, the project included 11 officers from the ARM, who successfully completed the training for the obligations related to giving support from the host nation. Promoting the personal professionalism and achievements, in 2006 these officers became the basis of the Coordination Centre, which gradually began the preparations for undertaking the tasks for support to KFOR.\n\nIn June 2007, having in mind the large meaning and the projected goals, the Coordination Centre was included in the formation of the Logistics Support Command in the General Staff of the ARM. In this manner as an addition to the participation in the mission in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lebanon, the ARM participates also in the mission for support to Kosovo.\n\n=== UNIFIL ===\nMacedonia participated in the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations in Lebanon, UNIFIL.\n\nThe security and prosperity in global terms depend more and more on the effective multilateral system. The strategic partnership with the Organization of the United Nations, whose Treaty represents the fundamental framework of the international relations, are the priority of the European Union and NATO on the international security scene. Hence, the contribution of the Republic of Macedonia in the military part with respect to the missions led by the Organization of the United National is a confirmation of the effective membership of the Republic of Macedonia in the Organization and its strategic determinations.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThe primary arm of the military in North Macedonia is the Army of the Republic of North Macedonia (APCM); it is commanded by the [[Minister of Defense (North Macedonia)|Minister of Defense]] through the Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]] (CGS).

The rapid reaction forces represent the main active combat capability of the military and consist of the [[1st Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Macedonia)|1st Mechanized Infantry Brigade]]. The strategic reserve forces provide reserve brigades that can be called up in times of emergency.\n\n=== Aviation Brigade of North Macedonia ===\n[[North Macedonia Air Force|Air Warfare and Air Defence of North Macedonia]] has an important role as air support element of ground forces and in enhancing flight safety. One of the main goals of the Aviation Brigade is to build up an air surveillance system, which will be the cornerstone of the air traffic safety and airspace control. The air component is made up by the Aviation and the Air Defense Forces. It is located in [[Skopje \"Alexander the Great\" Airport|Skopje International Airport]] (near [[Skopje]])\n\n{{Army of Macedonia}}\n\n*Aviation Brigade Headquarters\n**Pilot Training Center (Bell 206B-3)\n**Training Squadron (Zlin 242L and Zlin 143L)\n**Combat Helicopter Squadron \"Night Thunders\" (Mi-24V x 4)\n**Transport Helicopter Squadron \"Bucephalus\" (Mi-8MT/17 x 6)\n**Air Surveillance and Air Target Acquisition Transmission Company\n**Air Defence Battalion \"Cobras\" (9K35 Strela-10 x 21)\n**Logistical Support Squadron\n** Special Parachute Air Operations Platoon \"Falcons\"(An-2R)\n\n=== Special Operations Regiment ===\n\n[[Wolves (military)|Special Operations Regiment]], is the main command for Special Units of the Army of Republic of North Macedonia.

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed by Parker.

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed by Parker. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way. Margaux's agent Glenn carries a message from the network stating that her show is now cancelled because Parker was live streaming the whole thing with her phone.

{"title_page": "Coaching tree", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=January 2011}}\nA '''coaching tree''' is similar to a [[family tree]] except that it shows the relationships of [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] instead of family members. There are several ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.\n\nCoaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.\n\nThe phrase \"coaching tree\" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.\n\nCoaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture. They are often referenced by various media outlets, such as ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html|title=All roads lead to Walsh...sort of|work=ESPN.com|first=Len|last= Pasquarelli}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nIn 1998, half of the active head coaches in the [[National Football League]] could be traced to [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[Tom Landry]].  Of those fifteen coaches, four (plus Walsh and Landry) had coached a [[Super Bowl]] winning team.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Maxwell\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John C.

The Colts later hired [[Frank Reich]]. The only three NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]]. Therefore, Reich is connected to Reid through Pederson.\n\nCoaching tree examples (shown visually below) include Bill Walsh, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], and Bill Parcells.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Coaching Trees.GIF]]\n\n==Philosophical tree connections==\nCoaching trees can also show a philosophical relationship between a mentor head coach and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Below is a list of current and former head coaches and who they primarily developed their philosophy under:\n\n*[[Norv Turner]]: Most recently, Turner worked as an offensive coordinator under [[Mike Nolan]] in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]]. However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree and was a Defensive Coordinator under Dennis Green. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.<ref>[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.\n*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].\n*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del R\u00edo got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].\n\nAdditionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.\n*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.\n\n==The Bill Belichick Tree==\n\nThe Belichick coaching tree is far reaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill & Bill League: How nearly every coach traces to two men|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/bill-belichicks-coaching-tree-14f9b4e309524d4d|title=Bill Belichick's Coaching Tree|website=www.stadiumtalk.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/extra-points/2015/01/03/bill_belichicks_coaching_tree_has_branches_both_fu|title=Bill Belichick\u2019s Coaching Tree Has Branches Both Lush and Barren {{!}} Boston.com|website=www.boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> due to the 17 assistant under him who have went on to become head coaches in the NFL and college and sprouted their own trees leading to  over 100 total offshoots which include 13 active NFL head coaches.\n* [[Bill Belichick]]\n**[[Nick Saban]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fanbuzz.com/college-football/sec/alabama/nick-saban-coaching-tree/|title=Nick Saban\u2019s Coaching Tree May Be His Greatest Achievement|last=Pinak|first=Patrick|date=2019-12-26|website=FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL {{!}} NCAA {{!}} NBA {{!}}  WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004),  [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006),[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n***[[Dean Pees]], [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] (1998\u20132003)\n*** [[Bobby Williams]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2000\u20132002)\n**** [[Don Treadwell]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2011\u20132013)\n**** [[Ben McAdoo]], [[New York Giants]] (2016\u20132017)\n*** [[Mark Dantonio]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (2004\u20132006), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2007\u20132020) \n****[[Dan Enos]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] (2010\u20132014)\n**** [[Pat Narduzzi]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] (2015\u2013present)\n***** [[Josh Conklin]], [[Wofford Terriers football|Wofford]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Brad Salem]], [[Augustana College (Illinois)]] (2005\u20132009)\n*** [[Scott Linehan]], [[St. Louis Rams]] (2006\u20132008) \n*** [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] (2007\u20132009), [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] (2010\u20132012)\n**** [[Tommy Spangler]], [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian]] (2017\u2013present)\n****[[Justin Wilcox (American football)|Justin Wilcox]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]] (2017\u2013present) \n***** [[Beau Baldwin]], [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]] (2020\u2013present)\n**** [[Frank Scelfo]], [[Southeastern Louisiana Lions football|Southeastern Louisiana]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Sam Pittman]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] (2020-present)\n*** [[Josh McDaniels]], [[Denver Broncos]] (2009\u20132010) (first served under Saban)\n*** [[Michael Haywood|Mike Haywood]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2009\u20132010), [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]] (2016\u20132018)\n*** [[Jimbo Fisher]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2010\u20132017), [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Mark Stoops]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] (2013\u2013present)\n***** [[Neal Brown]], [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] (2015\u20132018); [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (2019\u2013present)\n***** [[Dean Hood]], [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] (2019-present)\n**** [[Randy Sanders]], [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|East Tennessee State]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Jason Garrett]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] (2011\u20132019)\n*** [[Curt Cignetti]], [[IUP Crimson Hawks football|IUP]] (2011\u20132016), [[Elon Phoenix football|Elon]] (2017\u20132018), [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] (2019\u2013present)\n*** [[Pat Shurmur]], [[Cleveland Browns]] (2011\u20132012), [[New York Giants]] (2018\u20132019)\n**** [[Mark Whipple]], [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]] (2014\u20132018)\n*** [[Will Muschamp]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] (2011\u20132014), [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (2016\u2013present) \n**** [[D.

There are several ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.\n\nCoaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.\n\nThe phrase \"coaching tree\" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.\n\nCoaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture. They are often referenced by various media outlets, such as ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html|title=All roads lead to Walsh...sort of|work=ESPN.com|first=Len|last= Pasquarelli}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nIn 1998, half of the active head coaches in the [[National Football League]] could be traced to [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[Tom Landry]].  Of those fifteen coaches, four (plus Walsh and Landry) had coached a [[Super Bowl]] winning team.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Maxwell\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John C.

The Colts later hired [[Frank Reich]]. The only three NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]].

However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree and was a Defensive Coordinator under Dennis Green. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.<ref>[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.\n*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].\n*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del R\u00edo got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].\n\nAdditionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.\n*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.\n\n==The Bill Belichick Tree==\n\nThe Belichick coaching tree is far reaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill & Bill League: How nearly every coach traces to two men|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/bill-belichicks-coaching-tree-14f9b4e309524d4d|title=Bill Belichick's Coaching Tree|website=www.stadiumtalk.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/extra-points/2015/01/03/bill_belichicks_coaching_tree_has_branches_both_fu|title=Bill Belichick\u2019s Coaching Tree Has Branches Both Lush and Barren {{!}} Boston.com|website=www.boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> due to the 17 assistant under him who have went on to become head coaches in the NFL and college and sprouted their own trees leading to  over 100 total offshoots which include 13 active NFL head coaches.\n* [[Bill Belichick]]\n**[[Nick Saban]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fanbuzz.com/college-football/sec/alabama/nick-saban-coaching-tree/|title=Nick Saban\u2019s Coaching Tree May Be His Greatest Achievement|last=Pinak|first=Patrick|date=2019-12-26|website=FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL {{!}} NCAA {{!}} NBA {{!}}  WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004),  [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006),[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n***[[Dean Pees]], [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] (1998\u20132003)\n*** [[Bobby Williams]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2000\u20132002)\n**** [[Don Treadwell]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2011\u20132013)\n**** [[Ben McAdoo]], [[New York Giants]] (2016\u20132017)\n*** [[Mark Dantonio]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (2004\u20132006), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2007\u20132020) \n****[[Dan Enos]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] (2010\u20132014)\n**** [[Pat Narduzzi]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] (2015\u2013present)\n***** [[Josh Conklin]], [[Wofford Terriers football|Wofford]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Brad Salem]], [[Augustana College (Illinois)]] (2005\u20132009)\n*** [[Scott Linehan]], [[St. Louis Rams]] (2006\u20132008) \n*** [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] (2007\u20132009), [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] (2010\u20132012)\n**** [[Tommy Spangler]], [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian]] (2017\u2013present)\n****[[Justin Wilcox (American football)|Justin Wilcox]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]] (2017\u2013present) \n***** [[Beau Baldwin]], [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]] (2020\u2013present)\n**** [[Frank Scelfo]], [[Southeastern Louisiana Lions football|Southeastern Louisiana]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Sam Pittman]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] (2020-present)\n*** [[Josh McDaniels]], [[Denver Broncos]] (2009\u20132010) (first served under Saban)\n*** [[Michael Haywood|Mike Haywood]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2009\u20132010), [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]] (2016\u20132018)\n*** [[Jimbo Fisher]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2010\u20132017), [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Mark Stoops]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] (2013\u2013present)\n***** [[Neal Brown]], [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] (2015\u20132018); [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (2019\u2013present)\n***** [[Dean Hood]], [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] (2019-present)\n**** [[Randy Sanders]], [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|East Tennessee State]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Jason Garrett]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] (2011\u20132019)\n*** [[Curt Cignetti]], [[IUP Crimson Hawks football|IUP]] (2011\u20132016), [[Elon Phoenix football|Elon]] (2017\u20132018), [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] (2019\u2013present)\n*** [[Pat Shurmur]], [[Cleveland Browns]] (2011\u20132012), [[New York Giants]] (2018\u20132019)\n**** [[Mark Whipple]], [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]] (2014\u20132018)\n*** [[Will Muschamp]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] (2011\u20132014), [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (2016\u2013present) \n**** [[D.

After his death, his widow, [[Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans]], donated his collection of books to [[Duke University]]. Today, this collection forms the foundation of the History of Medicine Collections in the [[Duke University Libraries|David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJosiah Charles Trent was born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, on 7 August 1914, the youngest of four children. His father, Josiah Charles Trent, was from [[Arkansas]] and a merchant who did business with both [[settler]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. His mother, Mary Simpson Trent, was born in [[Mississippi]] and was a music teacher.\n\n===Education===\nAs a child, Trent attended the public schools in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and was graduated from high school with honors at the age of sixteen. He then attended [[Duke University]], and received his A.B. degree with honors in 1934 at the age of 19. He then began studying medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received an M.D. with honors in 1938.

Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.\n\nThe breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830, a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. A [[breed society]] was formed in 1877. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as \"the breed that built Australia\". \n\nDuring the [[First World War]], population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanisation and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening period, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.\n\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clydesdale wagon.jpg|thumb|Two New Zealand Clydesdales pulling a wagon]]\nThe Clydesdale takes its name from [[Clydesdale]], the old name for [[Lanarkshire]], noted for the [[River Clyde]].<ref name=IMH>{{cite web|url=http://imh.org/exhibits/online/clydesdale |title=Clydesdale|publisher=International Museum of the Horse|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In the mid-18th century, [[Flemish]] [[stallion]]s were imported to Scotland and bred to local [[mare]]s, resulting in [[foal]]s that were larger than the existing local stock. These included a [[black (horse)|black]] unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed [[bay (horse)|dark-brown]] stallion owned by the [[James Douglas-Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]].<ref name=Society/>\n\nAnother prominent stallion was a {{convert|16.1|hands|cm|disp=flip|0|abbr=on}} [[driving (horse)|coach horse]] stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze. Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early nineteenth century, and in 1806, a [[filly]], later known as \"Lampits mare\" after the farm name of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion. This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today. One of her foals was Thompson's Black Horse (known as Glancer), which was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed.<ref name=Society>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorsesociety.com/breed-history.html|title=Breed History|publisher=Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=4 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909020346/http://clydesdalehorsesociety.com/breed-history.html|archive-date=9 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow.<ref name=Hendricks/> Another theory of their origin, that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century, was also promulgated in the late 18th century. However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.<ref>Biddell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records dating back to 1837.<ref name=IMH/> This programme consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares.<ref>McNeilage, p. 73</ref> Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England.\n\n[[File:Clydesdale, draw.JPG|thumb|A 1904 drawing of a Clydesdale mare]] \nThrough extensive [[crossbreed]]ing with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same.<ref name=Hendricks>Hendricks, pp. 133\u2013134</ref> In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American [[stud book]] was published in 1882.<ref name=IMH/> In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded to compete with the Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of [[Shire horse|Shire]] blood into the Clydesdale.<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, pp. 284\u2013285</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with 1617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone. Between 1884 and 1945, export certificates were issued for 20,183 horses. These horses were exported to other countries in the [[British Empire]], as well as North and South America, continental Europe, and Russia.<ref name=Society/> \n\nThe [[First World War]] had the conscription of thousands of [[Horses in World War I|horses]] for the war effort, and after the war, breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanised. This decline continued between the wars.  Following the Second World War, the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949.

Article Begins Here -->\n\nThe '''Clydesdale''' is a [[horse breed|breed]] of [[draught horse]] named for and derived from the farm horses of [[Clydesdale]], the old name for the county of [[Lanarkshire]], in [[Scotland]]. Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.\n\nThe breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830, a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. The first [[breed registry]] was formed in 1877. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as \"the breed that built Australia\". \n\nDuring [[World War I]], population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanisation and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening period, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.\n\n==Breed characteristics==\nThe [[equine conformation|conformation]] of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was a compact horse smaller than the [[Shire horse|Shire]], [[Percheron]], and [[Belgian horse|Belgian]]. Beginning in the 1940s, breeding animals were [[selective breeding|selected]] to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows. Today, the Clydesdale stands {{cvt|162|to|183|cm}} high and weighs {{convert|1800|to|2000|lbs|kg}}.<ref name=Dutson>Dutson, pp. 348\u2013351</ref> Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 183 cm and weighing up to {{convert|2200|lbs|kg}}.

They are also [[draft horse showing|shown]] and ridden, as well as kept for pleasure. Clydesdales are known to be the popular breed choice with carriage services and parade horses because of their white, feathery feet.<ref name=Dutson/> \n\nAlong with carriage horses, Clydesdales are also used as show horses. They are shown in lead line and harness classes at county and state fairs, as well as national exhibitions. \nSome of the most famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]]. These horses were first owned by the [[Anheuser-Busch|Budweiser Brewery]] at the end of [[Prohibition in the United States]], and have since become an international symbol of both the breed and the brand. The Budweiser breeding program, with its strict standards of colour and conformation, have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that many people believe that Clydesdales are always [[bay (horse)|bay]] with [[Horse markings|white markings]].<ref name=Dutson/> \n\nSome Clydesdales are used for riding and can be shown under saddle, as well as being driven. Due to their calm disposition, they have proven to be very easy to train and capable of making exceptional trial horses. Clydesdales and Shires are used by the British [[Household Cavalry]] as drum horses, leading parades on ceremonial and state occasions. The horses are eye-catching colours, including [[piebald]], [[skewbald]], and [[roan (horse)|roan]]. To be used for this purpose, a drum horse must stand a minimum of {{hands|17}} high.
