This had the additional effect of locating both of the Alpha chapters of Tau Beta Sigma and Kappa Kappa Psi at the same school. The founding members of the Alpha chapter were: Rosemary Wright, Frances Martin, Ebba Jensen, Mary Belle Reece, Margaret Stanffer, Bernice Friend, and Maribeth Crist. Later, on May 4, 1946, the Beta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was founded at Texas Tech.\n\n===Sorority Beginnings<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/tech-band|title=Brief History of the Founding of Tech Band Sorority|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>===\n\nThe first practical idea for establishing a \u201cband sorority\u201d for college and university bandswomen came about during the spring semester of 1939. Wava Banes, along with two of her classmates (Emily SoRelle and Ruth La Nell Williams), took the idea to director D.O. Wiley of the Texas Technological College Band.  The idea, patterned after Kappa Kappa Psi, began to come together the following semester and resulted in the campus organization Tau Beta Sigma.  Much like the Fraternity, Tau Beta Sigma's purpose at Tech was to serve as an honorary service and leadership recognition society, but was designed especially to provide the important additional social, educational, and other positive experiences needed by women in the band.  The fledgling organization petitioned for recognition as an official campus organization from Dean of Women Mary Doak in spring 1940.\n\nDuring these initial meetings of 1939\u201340, the women elected officers and began work on sorority crests and jewelry.  The first officers of the organization were:  president, Wava Banes; vice-president, Emily SoRelle; secretary, Lillian Horner; treasurer, Nita Furr; reporter, Barbara Griggs; and faculty sponsor, Mrs. D. O. Wiley.  Miss SoRelle provided all of the sketch work on the emblem and shield that were adopted as the official emblems of the sorority.  However, two of the founding members, Wava and Emily, graduated at the end of the spring 1940 term.  As band enrollment changed due to participation in World War II, the girls of the Tech Bands continued to develop the fledgling organization.  By October 1941, TBS had begun communications with the National Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi for assistance in becoming a national organization.\n\nIn June 1943, the Tech women petitioned the Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi to become an auxiliary part of the National Fraternity as an active chapter. Accepting the group under these circumstances, however, would have entailed a complete revision of the Kappa Kappa Psi constitution. With World War II in progress, it was unsure as to when the National Chapter would hold their next convention where the issue could be brought to debate. Rather than postponing action on the women's request indefinitely, the women at Texas Tech approached A. Frank Martin, Grand Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi, in January 1946 to provide assistance in forming their own national organization, just as the National Fraternity had done in 1919. Until a national convention of Kappa Kappa Psi could be held and the matter clarified, Tau Beta Sigma could be considered the \u201csister organization\u201d of the Fraternity. The Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi agreed that Tau Beta Sigma could share in all fraternal publications.\n\nThrough the assistance of A. Frank Martin, the ritual and National Constitution were completed.  Likewise, the Balfour Company completed designs for the sorority badge and pledge pin.  When applying for a national charter, D.O. Wiley and the girls at Texas Tech again turned to A. Frank Martin and offered to turn over their work and the name Tau Beta Sigma to the women's band sorority at Oklahoma A&M, known as Kappa Psi, to submit the articles of incorporation in Oklahoma.  Through this act, the chapter at Oklahoma A&M would become the Alpha chapter.  As part of this agreement, the chapter at Texas Tech, Beta, would be known as the founding location of the Sorority and the members stipulated that Wava Banes would be known as the Founder, the agreement also specified that the 1st National President would be from the Beta chapter.\n\nSimilar women's organizations at Colorado University and the University of Oklahoma submitted petitions to join with the Texas Tech and O.A.M.C. chapter prior to the official charter being received.  On March 26, 1946, a charter was granted by the Department of State for the State of Oklahoma legally establishing \u201cTau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Band Sorority,\u201d later amended to \u201cTau Beta Sigma.\u201d On May 4 of 1946, the members of the Alpha chapter traveled to Lubbock, Texas, to officially install the women of Texas Tech as the Beta chapter of the National Sorority.\n\nSince that time, Tau Beta Sigma has expanded to over 230 campuses across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbsigma.org/chapters/|title=Chapter Listing {{!}} Tau Beta Sigma|website=www.tbsigma.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\n===Ties to other organizations===\n\nIn addition to the close relationship with Kappa Kappa Psi, Tau Beta Sigma has historical and current relationships with several other organizations. One such relationship is with [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], an international fraternity for women with a strong interest in music.\n\nIn 1999, joint statements were issued by the leadership of Tau Beta Sigma and Sigma Alpha Iota, along with Kappa Kappa Psi and [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], affirming \"that there are equally important roles for Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Alpha Iota, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma to fulfill on any campus where our chapters mutually exist, now or in the future. Each organization possesses a distinct mission and, as a result, fulfills a unique and vital role in the musical environment of a college campus\" and that \"A member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota can hold simultaneous membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma, subject to his/her own interests and the eligibility requirements of the other organizations. The same holds true for a member of Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma with regard to membership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota.\"<ref name=jointstatement>{{cite web|url=http://www.orgs.okstate.edu/kkp/generalinfo.htm|title=Joint Statements of Kappa Kappa Psi and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and of Kappa Kappa Psi, Tau Beta Sigma, Sigma Alpha Iota, and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia|publisher=Alpha chapter, Kappa Kappa Psi|accessdate=2007-04-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215041233/http://www.orgs.okstate.edu/kkp/generalinfo.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Programs ==\n\n===National Programs===\n\n====Women in Music Series<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/women-in-music|title=Women in Music|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>====\n\n====Crescendo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/crescendo|title=Crescendo: A Musical Youth Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>====\n\n====Bandswomen Networking Program<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/bandswomen|title=Bandswomen Networking Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>====\n\n=== Joint Programs with Kappa Kappa Psi ===\n\n==== National Intercollegiate Band ====\n{{Main|National Intercollegiate Band}}\n\n[[File:National Intercollegiate Band 1947.jpg|thumb|left|First National Intercollegiate Band, 1947]]\n\nThe '''National Intercollegiate Band''' ('''NIB''') is a [[concert band]], sponsored by honorary band fraternity and sorority [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] and Tau Beta Sigma, that performs every two years at the [[List of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma national conventions|national convention]] of the two organizations.

There are seven districts divided by geography: Northeast, Southeast, North Central, Midwest, Southwest, Western, and International (a hypothetical district comprising all chapters outside the United States). Each district is led by one or more District Counselors, as well as a council of elected student officers by the members of the Districts.\n\nDistrict Counselors are regional advisors for the Sorority. They actively work with each district's student leadership and communicate with chapter sponsors. District Counselors are appointed by the National President for two-year terms, and are currently limited to serving three terms.\n\nThe districts are as follows:\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

This had the additional effect of locating both of the Alpha chapters of Tau Beta Sigma and Kappa Kappa Psi at the same school. The founding members of the Alpha chapter were: Rosemary Wright, Frances Martin, Ebba Jensen, Mary Belle Reece, Margaret Stanffer, Bernice Friend, and Maribeth Crist. Later, on May 4, 1946, the Beta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was founded at Texas Tech.\n\n===Sorority Beginnings<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/tech-band|title=Brief History of the Founding of Tech Band Sorority|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>===\n\nThe first practical idea for establishing a \u201cband sorority\u201d for college and university bandswomen came about during the spring semester of 1939. Wava Banes, along with two of her classmates (Emily SoRelle and Ruth La Nell Williams), took the idea to director D.O. Wiley of the Texas Technological College Band.  The idea, patterned after Kappa Kappa Psi, began to come together the following semester and resulted in the campus organization Tau Beta Sigma.  Much like the Fraternity, Tau Beta Sigma\u2019s purpose at Tech was to serve as an honorary service and leadership recognition society, but was designed especially to provide the important additional social, educational, and other positive experiences needed by women in the band.  The fledgling organization petitioned for recognition as an official campus organization from Dean of Women Mary Doak in spring 1940.\n\nDuring these initial meetings of 1939\u201340, the women elected officers and began work on sorority crests and jewelry.  The first officers of the organization were:  president, Wava Banes; vice-president, Emily SoRelle; secretary, Lillian Horner; treasurer, Nita Furr; reporter, Barbara Griggs; and faculty sponsor, Mrs. D. O. Wiley.  Miss SoRelle provided all of the sketch work on the emblem and shield that were adopted as the official emblems of the sorority.  However, two of the founding members, Wava and Emily, graduated at the end of the spring 1940 term.  As band enrollment changed due to participation in World War II, the girls of the Tech Bands continued to develop the fledgling organization.  By October 1941, TBS had begun communications with the National Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi for assistance in becoming a national organization.\n\nIn June 1943, the Tech women petitioned the Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi to become an auxiliary part of the National Fraternity as an active chapter. Accepting the group under these circumstances, however, would have entailed a complete revision of the Kappa Kappa Psi constitution. With World War II in progress, it was unsure as to when the National Chapter would hold their next convention where the issue could be brought to debate. Rather than postponing action on the women\u2019s request indefinitely, the women at Texas Tech approached A. Frank Martin, Grand Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi, in January 1946 to provide assistance in forming their own national organization, just as the National Fraternity had done in 1919. Until a national convention of Kappa Kappa Psi could be held and the matter clarified, Tau Beta Sigma could be considered the \u201csister organization\u201d of the Fraternity. The Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi agreed that Tau Beta Sigma could share in all fraternal publications.\n\nThrough the assistance of A. Frank Martin, the ritual and National Constitution were completed.  Likewise, the Balfour Company completed designs for the sorority badge and pledge pin.  When applying for a national charter, D.O. Wiley and the girls at Texas Tech again turned to A. Frank Martin and offered to turn over their work and the name Tau Beta Sigma to the women\u2019s band sorority at Oklahoma A&M, known as Kappa Psi, to submit the articles of incorporation in Oklahoma.  Through this act, the chapter at Oklahoma A&M would become the Alpha chapter.  As part of this agreement, the chapter at Texas Tech, Beta, would be known as the founding location of the Sorority and the members stipulated that Wava Banes would be known as the Founder, the agreement also specified that the 1st National President would be from the Beta chapter.\n\nSimilar women\u2019s organizations at Colorado University and the University of Oklahoma submitted petitions to join with the Texas Tech and O.A.M.C. chapter prior to the official charter being received.  On March 26, 1946, a charter was granted by the Department of State for the State of Oklahoma legally establishing \u201cTau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Band Sorority,\u201d later amended to \u201cTau Beta Sigma.\u201d On May 4 of 1946, the members of the Alpha chapter traveled to Lubbock, Texas, to officially install the women of Texas Tech as the Beta chapter of the National Sorority.\n\nSince that time, Tau Beta Sigma has expanded to over 230 campuses across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbsigma.org/chapters/|title=Chapter Listing {{!}} Tau Beta Sigma|website=www.tbsigma.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\n===Ties to other organizations===\n\nIn addition to the close relationship with Kappa Kappa Psi, Tau Beta Sigma has historical and current relationships with several other organizations. One such relationship is with [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], an international fraternity for women with a strong interest in music.\n\nIn 1999, joint statements were issued by the leadership of Tau Beta Sigma and Sigma Alpha Iota, along with Kappa Kappa Psi and [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], affirming \"that there are equally important roles for Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Alpha Iota, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma to fulfill on any campus where our chapters mutually exist, now or in the future. Each organization possesses a distinct mission and, as a result, fulfills a unique and vital role in the musical environment of a college campus\" and that \"A member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota can hold simultaneous membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma, subject to his/her own interests and the eligibility requirements of the other organizations. The same holds true for a member of Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma with regard to membership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota.\"<ref name=jointstatement>{{cite web|url=http://www.orgs.okstate.edu/kkp/generalinfo.htm|title=Joint Statements of Kappa Kappa Psi and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and of Kappa Kappa Psi, Tau Beta Sigma, Sigma Alpha Iota, and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia|publisher=Alpha chapter, Kappa Kappa Psi|accessdate=2007-04-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215041233/http://www.orgs.okstate.edu/kkp/generalinfo.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Programs ==\n\n===National Programs===\n\n====Women in Music Series<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/women-in-music|title=Women in Music|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>====\n\n====Crescendo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/crescendo|title=Crescendo: A Musical Youth Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>====\n\n====Bandswomen Networking Program<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbsigma.org/bandswomen|title=Bandswomen Networking Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>====\n\n=== Joint Programs with Kappa Kappa Psi ===\n\n==== National Intercollegiate Band ====\n{{Main|National Intercollegiate Band}}\n\n[[File:National Intercollegiate Band 1947.jpg|thumb|left|First National Intercollegiate Band, 1947]]\n\nThe '''National Intercollegiate Band''' ('''NIB''') is a [[concert band]], sponsored by honorary band fraternity and sorority [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] and Tau Beta Sigma, that performs every two years at the [[List of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma national conventions|national convention]] of the two organizations.

Each district is led by one or more District Counselors, as well as a council of elected student officers by the members of the Districts.\n\nDistrict Counselors are regional advisors for the Sorority.
