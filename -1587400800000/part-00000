Three first half goals by [[Val Fitzpatrick]] helped Cork draw with Kilkenny, for whom [[Angela Downey]] scored 1-10 and [[Bridie McGarry]] equalised from a sideline ball 25 yards from the left corner flag three minutes from the end, the third draw in the championship between the teams since 1974. Cathy Landers had to score a point from midfield to give Cork victory, just as Helena O'Neill had been faced with a similar free to equalise in 1974. Helena succeeded, Cathy did not. The replay was attended by a large crowd (it was claimed that all three semi-finals had record attendances for this stage but records are incomplete) and finished Cork 5-4 to 3-10 before 20 minutes of extra time was required to separate the sides. Cork scored 2-4 to Kilkenny\u2019s 0-2 in extra time. Their goals came from [[Mary Geaney]] and [[Pat Lenihan]] (two each), [[Mary O'Leary (camogie)|Mary O'Leary]] who scored 1-8, [[Marion McCarthy]] and [[Marion Sweeney]].\n\n==Final==\nA dramatic point from a 50-yard free in the last minute by [[Mary O'Leary (camogie)|Mary O'Leary]] leaving Dublin lamenting their third defeat in a final in six years. It followed the decisive goal with five minutes to go when [[Mary O'Leary (camogie)|Mary O'Leary]] collected the ball 50 yards from goal and sent in a hard driven shot which dipped below the crossbar. O'Leary scored 1-6 in a fast paced game. [[Marion McCarthy]] scored a Dublin goal from the edge of the square after 54 seconds, Cork attacked from the restart and when [[Yvonne Redmond]] was slow to clear [[Pat Lenihan]] scored a Cork goal after just 90 seconds to complete the quickest two goals in All Ireland camogie history, [[Una Crowley]] then had Dublin's second goal after seven minutes and Dublin led 2-5 to 1-3 at half
