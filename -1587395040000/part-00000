He was one of the first official diplomats to bring back valuable information about [[Central Asia]], including the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian remains]] of the [[Macedonian Empire]] as well as the [[Parthian Empire]], to the [[Han dynasty]] imperial court, then ruled by [[Emperor Wu of Han]].\n\nHe played an important pioneering role for the future Chinese conquest of lands west of [[Xinjiang]], including swaths of [[Central Asia]] and even lands south of the [[Hindu Kush]] (see [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]]).\n\nToday, Zhang Qian's travels are associated with the major route of transcontinental trade, the [[Silk Road]]. His missions opened trade routes between East and West and exposed different products and kingdoms to each other through trade. Zhang's accounts were compiled by [[Sima Qian]] in the 1st century BC. The [[Central Asia]]n parts of the Silk Road routes were expanded around 114 BC largely through the missions of and exploration by Zhang Qian.<ref name=\"boulnois\">{{Cite book|first=Luce|last=Boulnois|year=2005|title=Silk Road: Monks, Warriors & Merchants|publisher=Odyssey Books|location=Hong Kong|page=[https://archive.org/details/silkroad00luce/page/66 66]|isbn=962-217-721-2|url=https://archive.org/details/silkroad00luce/page/66}}</ref> Today, Zhang is considered a Chinese national hero and revered for the key role he played in opening China to the wider world of commercial trade.\n\n==Zhang Qian's Missions==\n[[File:Statue of Zhang Qian.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Zhang Qian in [[Shaanxi History Museum]], [[Xi'an]]]]\nZhang Qian was born in Chengdu district just east of [[Hanzhong]] in the north-central province of [[Shaanxi]], [[China]].<ref>''Silk Road: Monks, Warriors & Merchants on the Silk Road'', p. 61.

At the time the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] tribes controlled what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and dominated the [[Western Regions]], Xiyu (\u897f\u57df), the areas neighbouring the territory of the Han Dynasty. The Han emperor was interested in establishing commercial ties with distant lands but outside contact was prevented by the hostile Xiongnu.\n\nThe Han court dispatched Zhang Qian, a military officer who was familiar with the Xiongnu, to the [[Western Regions]] in 138 BC with a group of ninety-nine members to make contact and build an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] against the Xiongnu.

The Yuezhi were agricultural people who produced strong horses and many unknown crops including [[alfalfa]] for animal [[fodder]]. However, the Yuezhi were too settled to desire war against the Xiongnu. Zhang spent a year in Yuezhi and the adjacent [[Bactria]]n territory, documenting their cultures, lifestyles and economy, before beginning his return trip to China, this time following the southern edge of the Tarim Basin.<ref>Watson (1993), p. 232.</ref>\nOn his return trip he was again captured by the Xiongnu who again spared his life because they valued his sense of duty and composure in the face of death. Two years later the Xiongnu leader died and in the midst of chaos and infighting Zhang Qian escaped. Of the original mission of just over a hundred men, only Zhang Qian and Ganfu managed to return to China.\n\nZhang Qian returned in 125 BC with detailed news for the Emperor, showing that sophisticated civilizations existed to the West, with which China could advantageously develop relations. The Shiji relates that \"the Emperor learned of the Dayuan (\u5927\u5b9b), Daxia (\u5927\u590f), Anxi (\u5b89\u606f), and the others, all great states rich in unusual products whose people cultivated the land and made their living in much the same way as the Chinese.

However, the task remained to find a trade route not obstructed by the Xiongnu to India. Zhang Qian set out on a second mission to forge a route from China to India via [[Sichuan]], but after many attempts this effort proved unsuccessful. In 119\u2013115 BC Zhang Qian was sent on a third mission by the emperor, to develop ties with the [[Wusun]] (\u70cf\u5b6b) people.<ref>''Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture'', p. 615.

Zhang Qian visited directly the kingdom of [[Dayuan]] (\u5927\u5b9b) in [[Fergana]], the territories of the [[Yuezhi]] (\u6708\u6c0f) in [[Transoxiana]], the [[Bactria]]n country of [[Daxia]] (\u5927\u590f) with its remnants of [[Greco-Bactrian]] rule, and [[Kangju]] (\u5eb7\u5c45). He also made reports on neighbouring countries that he did not visit, such as Anxi (\u5b89\u606f) ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories), Tiaozhi (\u689d\u652f/\u6761\u652f) ([[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]]), Shendu (\u8eab\u6bd2) ([[Pakistan]]) and the [[Wusun]] (\u70cf\u5b6b).\n\n===Dayuan (\u5927\u5b9b, Ferghana)===\n[[File:ZhangQianTravel.jpg|thumb|349px|Countries described in Zhang Qian's report. Visited countries are highlighted in [[blue]].]]\n\nAfter being released from captivity by Xiongnu, Zhang Qian visited [[Dayuan]], located in the [[Fergana]] region west of the [[Tarim Basin]]. The people of Dayuan were being portrayed as sophisticated urban dwellers similar to the Parthians and the Bactrians. The name Dayuan is thought to be a transliteration of the word ''[[Yona]]'', the Greek descendants that occupied the region from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE. It was during this stay that Zhang reported the famous tall and powerful \"blood-sweating\" [[Ferghana horse]]. The refusal by Dayuan to offer these horses to Emperor Wu of Han resulted in two [[War of the Heavenly Horses|punitive campaigns]] launched by the Han Dynasty to acquire these horses by force.\n\n:\"Dayuan lies south-west of the territory of the Xiongnu, some 10,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' (5,000 kilometres) directly west of China. The people are settled on the land, ploughing the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. The people live in houses in fortified cities, there being some seventy or more cities of various sizes in the region. The population numbers several hundred thousand\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nLater the [[Han dynasty]] conquered the region in the [[War of the Heavenly Horses]].\n\n===Rouzhi (\u6708\u6c0f, Yuezhi)===\nAfter obtaining the help of the king of Dayuan, Zhang Qian went south-west to the territory of the [[Yuezhi]], with whom he was supposed to obtain a military alliance against the Xiongnu.\n\n:\"The Great Yuezhi live some 2,000 or 3,000 li (1,000 or 1,500 kilometres) west of Dayuan, north of the Gui ([[Oxus]]) river. They are bordered to the south by Daxia (Bactria), on the west by [[#Anxi|Anxi]], and on the north by [[Kangju|Kangju (\u5eb7\u5c45)]]. They are a nation of nomads, moving place to place with their herds and their customs are like those of the Xiongnu. They have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors.\" (adapted from [[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nZhang Qian also describes the origins of the Yuezhi, explaining they came from the eastern part of the [[Tarim Basin]].  This has encouraged some historians to connect them to the [[tarim mummies|Caucasoid mummies of the Tarim]]. (The question of links between the Yuezhi and the [[Tocharians]]  of the Tarim is more controversial.)\n\n:\"The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the Qilian or Heavenly Mountains ([[Tian Shan]]) and [[Dunhuang]], but after they were defeated by the Xiongnu they moved far away to the west, beyond Dayuan (Ferghana), where they attacked the people of Daxia (Bactria) and set up the court of their king on the northern bank of the Gui (Oxus) river.\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nA smaller group of Yuezhi, the \"Little Yuezhi\", were not able to follow the exodus and reportedly found refuge among the \"[[Qiang people|Qiang]] barbarians\".\n\nZhang was the first Chinese to write about one humped dromedary camels which he saw in this region.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese Recorder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=af9OAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1875|publisher=Presbyterian Mission Press|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Daxia (\u5927\u590f, Bactria)===\nZhang Qian probably witnessed the last period of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], as it was being subjugated by the nomadic Yuezhi. Only small powerless chiefs remained, who were apparently vassals to the Yuezhi horde. Their civilization was urban, almost identical to the civilizations of [[#Anxi|Anxi]] and Dayuan, and the population was numerous.\n\n:\"Daxia is situated over 2,000 ''li'' (1,000 kilometres) south-west of [[Dayuan]] (Ferghana), south of the Gui (Oxus) river. Its people cultivate the land, and have cities and houses. Their customs are like those of Dayuan. It has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities. The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. After the Great Yuezhi moved west and attacked and conquered Daxia, the entire country came under their sway. The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is Lanshi ([[Bactra]]) where all sorts of goods are bought and sold.\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, translation Burton Watson).\n\nCloth from Shu ([[Sichuan]]) was found there.<ref name=\"Hargett2006\">{{cite book|author=James M.

The name ''Shendu'' (\u8eab\u6bd2) comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word \"Sindhu\", meaning the Indus river of Pakistan. Sindh was one of the richest regions of India at the time, ruled by [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]s, which explains the reported cultural similarity between Bactria and India:\n\n:\"Southeast of Daxia is the kingdom of Shendu (Sindh)... Shendu, they told me, lies several thousand ''li'' south-east of Daxia (Bactria). The people cultivate the land and live much like the people of Daxia. The region is said to be hot and damp. The inhabitants ride elephants when they go in battle. The kingdom is situated on a great river ([[Indus River|Indus]])\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Anxi (\u5b89\u606f, Parthia)===\n{{Main|Parthian Empire}}\nZhang Qian identifies \"Anxi\" ({{zh|t=[[:zh:\u5b89\u606f\u5e1d\u570b|\u5b89\u606f]]}}) as an advanced urban civilization, like Dayuan (Ferghana) and Daxia (Bactria). The name \"Anxi\" is a transcription of \"[[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arshak]]\" ([[Arsaces]]),<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/notes10.html The Kingdom of Anxi]</ref> the name of the founder of [[Arsacid Empire]] that ruled the regions along the silk road between the [[Tedzhen river]] in the east and the [[Tigris]] in the west, and running through [[Aria]], [[Parthia]] proper, and [[Medes|Media]] proper.\n\n:\"Anxi is situated several thousand ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' west of the region of the Great Yuezhi. The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To the west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan ([[Hyrcania]]).\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Tiaozhi (\u6761\u652f, Seleucid Empire in Mesopotamia)===\nZhang Qian's reports on [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]], or Tiaozhi (\u6761\u652f), are in tenuous terms. He did not himself visit the region, and was only able to report what others told him.\n\n:\"Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) is situated several thousand ''li'' west of Anxi ([[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacid]] territory) and borders the \"Western Sea\" (which could refer to the [[Persian Gulf]] or [[Mediterranean]]). It is hot and damp, and the people live by cultivating the fields and planting rice... The people are very numerous and are ruled by many petty chiefs. The ruler of Anxi (the Arsacids) give orders to these chiefs and regards them as vassals.\" (adapted from [[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Kangju (\u5eb7\u5c45) northwest of Sogdiana (\u7c9f\u7279)===\nZhang Qian also visited directly the area of [[Sogdiana]] ([[Kangju]]), home to the Sogdian nomads:\n\n:\"Kangju is situated some 2,000 li (1,000 kilometres) north-west of Dayuan (Bactria). Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archer fighters. The country is small, and borders Dayuan. It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.\" (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Yancai (\u5944\u8521, Vast Steppe)===\n:\"Yancai lies some 2,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' (832 km) north-west of [[Kangju]] (centered on [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]] at Beitian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of [[Kangju]]. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shore-less lake, perhaps what is now known as the Northern Sea ([[Aral Sea]], distance between [[Tashkent]] to [[Aralsk]] is about 866 km)\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\njust a tip, dont trust everything on wikipedia\n\n==Death==\nThe ''[[Shiji]]'' reports that Zhang Qian returned from his final expedition to the Wusun in 115 BC. After his return he \"was honoured with the post of grand messenger, making him among the nine highest ministers of the government. A year or so later he died.\"<ref>Watson (1993), p. 240.</ref>\n<blockquote>\"The indications regarding the year of his death differ, but Shih Chih-mien (1961), p. 268 shows beyond doubt that he died in 113 B.C. His tomb is situated in Chang-chia ts'un \u5f35\u5bb6\u6751 near Ch'eng-ku . . . ; during repairs carried out in 1945 a clay mold with the inscription \u535a\u671b\u5bb6\u9020 [Home of the Bowang (Marquis)] was found, as reported by Ch'en Chih (1959), p. 162.\" Hulsew\u00e9 and Loewe (1979), p. 218, note 819.</blockquote>\n\n==Other achievements==\nFrom his missions he brought back many important products, the most important being [[alfalfa]] seeds (for growing horse [[fodder]]), strong horses with hard hooves, and knowledge of the extensive existence of new products, peoples and technologies of the outside world. He died ''c''. 114 BC after spending twenty-five years travelling on these dangerous and strategic missions. Although at a time in his life he was regarded with disgrace for being defeated by the Xiongnu, by the time of his death he had been bestowed with great honours by the emperor.<ref>Watson (1993), pp. 231\u2013239, 181, 231\u2013241.</ref><ref>''Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture'', pp. 614\u2013615.

He was one of the first official diplomats to bring back valuable information about [[Central Asia]], including the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian remains]] of the [[Macedonian Empire]] as well as the [[Parthian Empire]], to the [[Han dynasty]] imperial court, then ruled by [[Emperor Wu of Han]].\n\nHe played an important pioneering role for the future Chinese conquest of lands west of [[Xinjiang]], including swaths of [[Central Asia]] and even lands south of the [[Hindu Kush]] (see [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]]).\n\nToday, Zhang Qian's travels are associated with the major route of transcontinental trade, the [[Silk Road]]. His missions opened trade routes between East and West and exposed different products and kingdoms to each other through trade. Zhang's accounts were compiled by [[Sima Qian]] in the 1st century BC. The [[Central Asia]]n parts of the Silk Road routes were expanded around 114 BC largely through the missions of and exploration by Zhang Qian.<ref name=\"boulnois\">{{Cite book|first=Luce|last=Boulnois|year=2005|title=Silk Road: Monks, Warriors & Merchants|publisher=Odyssey Books|location=Hong Kong|page=[https://archive.org/details/silkroad00luce/page/66 66]|isbn=962-217-721-2|url=https://archive.org/details/silkroad00luce/page/66}}</ref> Today, Zhang is considered a Chinese national hero and revered for the key role he played in opening China to the wider world of commercial trade.\n\n==Zhang Qian's Missions==\n[[File:Statue of Zhang Qian.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Zhang Qian in [[Shaanxi History Museum]], [[Xi'an]]]]\nZhang Qian was born in Chengdu district just east of [[Hanzhong]] in the north-central province of [[Shaanxi]], [[China]].<ref>''Silk Road: Monks, Warriors & Merchants on the Silk Road'', p. 61.

At the time the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] tribes controlled what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and dominated the [[Western Regions]], Xiyu (\u897f\u57df), the areas neighbouring the territory of the Han Dynasty. The Han emperor was interested in establishing commercial ties with distant lands but outside contact was prevented by the hostile Xiongnu.\n\nThe Han court dispatched Zhang Qian, a military officer who was familiar with the Xiongnu, to the [[Western Regions]] in 138 BC with a group of ninety-nine members to make contact and build an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] against the Xiongnu. He was accompanied by a guide named Ganfu (\u7518\u7236), a Xiongnu who had been captured in war.<ref>Watson (1993), p. 231.</ref> The objective of Zhang Qian's first mission was to seek a military alliance with the [[Yuezhi]],<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China'', C.

The Yuezhi were agricultural people who produced strong horses and many unknown crops including [[alfalfa]] for animal [[fodder]]. However, the Yuezhi were too settled to desire war against the Xiongnu. Zhang spent a year in Yuezhi and the adjacent [[Bactria]]n territory, documenting their cultures, lifestyles and economy, before beginning his return trip to China, this time following the southern edge of the Tarim Basin.<ref>Watson (1993), p. 232.</ref>\nOn his return trip he was again captured by the Xiongnu who again spared his life because they valued his sense of duty and composure in the face of death. Two years later the Xiongnu leader died and in the midst of chaos and infighting Zhang Qian escaped. Of the original mission of just over a hundred men, only Zhang Qian and Ganfu managed to return to China.\n\nZhang Qian returned in 125 BC with detailed news for the Emperor, showing that sophisticated civilizations existed to the West, with which China could advantageously develop relations. The Shiji relates that \"the Emperor learned of the Dayuan (\u5927\u5b9b), Daxia (\u5927\u590f), Anxi (\u5b89\u606f), and the others, all great states rich in unusual products whose people cultivated the land and made their living in much the same way as the Chinese.

However, the task remained to find a trade route not obstructed by the Xiongnu to India. Zhang Qian set out on a second mission to forge a route from China to India via [[Sichuan]], but after many attempts this effort proved unsuccessful. In 119\u2013115 BC Zhang Qian was sent on a third mission by the emperor, to develop ties with the [[Wusun]] (\u70cf\u5b6b) people.<ref>''Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture'', p. 615.

Zhang Qian visited directly the kingdom of [[Dayuan]] (\u5927\u5b9b) in [[Fergana]], the territories of the [[Yuezhi]] (\u6708\u6c0f) in [[Transoxiana]], the [[Bactria]]n country of [[Daxia]] (\u5927\u590f) with its remnants of [[Greco-Bactrian]] rule, and [[Kangju]] (\u5eb7\u5c45). He also made reports on neighbouring countries that he did not visit, such as Anxi (\u5b89\u606f) ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories), Tiaozhi (\u689d\u652f/\u6761\u652f) ([[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]]), Shendu (\u8eab\u6bd2) ([[Pakistan]]) and the [[Wusun]] (\u70cf\u5b6b).\n\n===Dayuan (\u5927\u5b9b, Ferghana)===\n[[File:ZhangQianTravel.jpg|thumb|349px|Countries described in Zhang Qian's report. Visited countries are highlighted in [[blue]].]]\n\nAfter being released from captivity by Xiongnu, Zhang Qian visited [[Dayuan]], located in the [[Fergana]] region west of the [[Tarim Basin]]. The people of Dayuan were being portrayed as sophisticated urban dwellers similar to the Parthians and the Bactrians. The name Dayuan is thought to be a transliteration of the word ''[[Yona]]'', the Greek descendants that occupied the region from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE. It was during this stay that Zhang reported the famous tall and powerful \"blood-sweating\" [[Ferghana horse]]. The refusal by Dayuan to offer these horses to Emperor Wu of Han resulted in two [[War of the Heavenly Horses|punitive campaigns]] launched by the Han Dynasty to acquire these horses by force.\n\n:\"Dayuan lies south-west of the territory of the Xiongnu, some 10,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' (5,000 kilometres) directly west of China. The people are settled on the land, ploughing the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. The people live in houses in fortified cities, there being some seventy or more cities of various sizes in the region. The population numbers several hundred thousand\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nLater the [[Han dynasty]] conquered the region in the [[War of the Heavenly Horses]].\n\n===Rouzhi (\u6708\u6c0f, Yuezhi)===\nAfter obtaining the help of the king of Dayuan, Zhang Qian went south-west to the territory of the [[Yuezhi]], with whom he was supposed to obtain a military alliance against the Xiongnu.\n\n:\"The Great Yuezhi live some 2,000 or 3,000 li (1,000 or 1,500 kilometres) west of Dayuan, north of the Gui ([[Oxus]]) river. They are bordered to the south by Daxia (Bactria), on the west by [[#Anxi|Anxi]], and on the north by [[Kangju|Kangju (\u5eb7\u5c45)]]. They are a nation of nomads, moving place to place with their herds and their customs are like those of the Xiongnu. They have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors.\" (adapted from [[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nZhang Qian also describes the origins of the Yuezhi, explaining they came from the eastern part of the [[Tarim Basin]].  This has encouraged some historians to connect them to the [[tarim mummies|Caucasoid mummies of the Tarim]]. (The question of links between the Yuezhi and the [[Tocharians]]  of the Tarim is more controversial.)\n\n:\"The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the Qilian or Heavenly Mountains ([[Tian Shan]]) and [[Dunhuang]], but after they were defeated by the Xiongnu they moved far away to the west, beyond Dayuan (Ferghana), where they attacked the people of Daxia (Bactria) and set up the court of their king on the northern bank of the Gui (Oxus) river.\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nA smaller group of Yuezhi, the \"Little Yuezhi\", were not able to follow the exodus and reportedly found refuge among the \"[[Qiang people|Qiang]] barbarians\".\n\nZhang was the first Chinese to write about one humped dromedary camels which he saw in this region.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese Recorder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=af9OAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1875|publisher=Presbyterian Mission Press|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Daxia (\u5927\u590f, Bactria)===\nZhang Qian probably witnessed the last period of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], as it was being subjugated by the nomadic Yuezhi. Only small powerless chiefs remained, who were apparently vassals to the Yuezhi horde. Their civilization was urban, almost identical to the civilizations of [[#Anxi|Anxi]] and Dayuan, and the population was numerous.\n\n:\"Daxia is situated over 2,000 ''li'' (1,000 kilometres) south-west of [[Dayuan]] (Ferghana), south of the Gui (Oxus) river. Its people cultivate the land, and have cities and houses. Their customs are like those of Dayuan. It has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities. The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. After the Great Yuezhi moved west and attacked and conquered Daxia, the entire country came under their sway. The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is Lanshi ([[Bactra]]) where all sorts of goods are bought and sold.\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, translation Burton Watson).\n\nCloth from Shu ([[Sichuan]]) was found there.<ref name=\"Hargett2006\">{{cite book|author=James M.

The name ''Shendu'' (\u8eab\u6bd2) comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word \"Sindhu\", meaning the Indus river of Pakistan. Sindh was one of the richest regions of India at the time, ruled by [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]s, which explains the reported cultural similarity between Bactria and India:\n\n:\"Southeast of Daxia is the kingdom of Shendu (Sindh)... Shendu, they told me, lies several thousand ''li'' south-east of Daxia (Bactria). The people cultivate the land and live much like the people of Daxia. The region is said to be hot and damp. The inhabitants ride elephants when they go in battle. The kingdom is situated on a great river ([[Indus River|Indus]])\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Anxi (\u5b89\u606f, Parthia)===\n{{Main|Parthian Empire}}\nZhang Qian identifies \"Anxi\" ({{zh|t=[[:zh:\u5b89\u606f\u5e1d\u570b|\u5b89\u606f]]}}) as an advanced urban civilization, like Dayuan (Ferghana) and Daxia (Bactria). The name \"Anxi\" is a transcription of \"[[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arshak]]\" ([[Arsaces]]),<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/notes10.html The Kingdom of Anxi]</ref> the name of the founder of [[Arsacid Empire]] that ruled the regions along the silk road between the [[Tedzhen river]] in the east and the [[Tigris]] in the west, and running through [[Aria]], [[Parthia]] proper, and [[Medes|Media]] proper.\n\n:\"Anxi is situated several thousand ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' west of the region of the Great Yuezhi. The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To the west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan ([[Hyrcania]]).\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Tiaozhi (\u6761\u652f, Seleucid Empire in Mesopotamia)===\nZhang Qian's reports on [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]], or Tiaozhi (\u6761\u652f), are in tenuous terms. He did not himself visit the region, and was only able to report what others told him.\n\n:\"Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) is situated several thousand ''li'' west of Anxi ([[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacid]] territory) and borders the \"Western Sea\" (which could refer to the [[Persian Gulf]] or [[Mediterranean]]). It is hot and damp, and the people live by cultivating the fields and planting rice... The people are very numerous and are ruled by many petty chiefs. The ruler of Anxi (the Arsacids) give orders to these chiefs and regards them as vassals.\" (adapted from [[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Kangju (\u5eb7\u5c45) northwest of Sogdiana (\u7c9f\u7279)===\nZhang Qian also visited directly the area of [[Sogdiana]] ([[Kangju]]), home to the Sogdian nomads:\n\n:\"Kangju is situated some 2,000 li (1,000 kilometres) north-west of Dayuan (Bactria). Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archer fighters. The country is small, and borders Dayuan. It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.\" (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n===Yancai (\u5944\u8521, Vast Steppe)===\n:\"Yancai lies some 2,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' (832 km) north-west of [[Kangju]] (centered on [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]] at Beitian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of [[Kangju]]. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shore-less lake, perhaps what is now known as the Northern Sea ([[Aral Sea]], distance between [[Tashkent]] to [[Aralsk]] is about 866 km)\" ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).\n\n==Development of East-West contacts==\nFollowing Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial relations between China and Central as well as Western Asia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the end of the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC, initiating the development of the [[Silk Road]]:\n:\"The largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out.\" (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nMany objects were soon exchanged, and travelled as far as [[Guangzhou]] in the East, as suggested by the discovery of a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] box and various artefacts from Central Asia in the 122 BC tomb of King [[Zhao Mo]] of [[Nanyue]].\n\n[[File:HanWudiBuddhas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mogao Caves]] 8th-century mural depicting the [[pseudohistorical]] legend of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] worshipping \"golden man\" Buddha statues captured in 121 BC.]]\nMurals in [[Mogao Caves]] in [[Dunhuang]] describe the Emperor [[Han Wudi]] (156\u201387 BC) worshipping Buddhist statues, explaining them as \"golden men brought in 120 BC by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads\", although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshipping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature.\n\nChina also sent a mission to [[#Anxi|Anxi]], which were followed up by reciprocal missions from Parthian envoys around 100 BC:\n:\"When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of [[#Anxi|Anxi]], the king of Anxi (the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] ruler) dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this.\" (adapted from Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).\n\nThe Roman historian [[Florus]] describes the visit of numerous envoys, including ''[[Seres]]'' (Chinese or central Asians), to the first Roman Emperor [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], who reigned between 27 BC and 14:\n:\"Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]] sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the [[Seres]] came likewise, and the [[India]]ns who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years. In truth it needed but to look at their complexion to see that they were people of another world than ours.\" (\"Cathay and the way thither\", [[Henry Yule]]).\n\nIn 97 the Chinese general [[Ban Chao]] dispatched an envoy to [[Rome]] in the person of [[Gan Ying]].\n\nSeveral [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman embassies to China]] followed from 166, and are officially recorded in Chinese historical chronicles.\n\n==Death==\nThe ''[[Shiji]]'' reports that Zhang Qian returned from his final expedition to the Wusun in 115 BC.

Pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes also play a role in the biosynthesis of four important neurotransmitters: [[serotonin]] (5-HT), [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]: see [[Vitamin B6#Functions|vitamin B<sub>6</sub> functions]]. L-PGA is present in the diet and is produced endogenously by enzymatic conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to L-PGA and free amino acids. In the central nervous system (CNS), L-PGA was found to have a role in composition of neuro-active molecules. Its production has been linked to hepatic gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Lastly, it was shown that L-PGA facilitates ATP synthesis by stimulating de novo synthesis of purines.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Medical uses==\nAs a treatment for alcohol intoxication and liver disease, metadoxine is typically given intravenously as immediate release formulation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Acute alcohol intoxication===\nIn clinical studies, metadoxine has been reported to reduce half-life of ethanol in healthy volunteers and in acutely intoxicated patients; to accelerate the metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde into less toxic higher ketones and to improve their urinary clearance; to restore laboratory variables such as alcohol, ammonia, [[Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase|\u03b3-GT]], and [[alanine aminotransferase]]; and to improve clinical symptoms of alcohol intoxication, including psychomotor agitation, depression, aggressiveness, and equilibrium disorders.<ref name=addolorato/><ref name=martinez/> There is also evidence that metadoxine has an effect on reducing craving for alcohol.<ref name=shpilenya/> Data from clinical studies also support an effect of metadoxine on reducing indices of liver cell necrosis and fat accumulation in alcoholic fatty liver.<ref name=shpilenya/>\n\n===Liver disease===\nMetadoxine may block the differentiation step of preadipocytes by inhibiting CREB phosphorylation and binding to the cAMP response element, thereby repressing CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b during hormone-induced adipogenesis.<ref name=yang/> Metadoxine, when given in an immediate release form in doses from 300&nbsp;mg twice a day to 500&nbsp;mg three times a day of up to 3 months, has been shown to improve biochemical indices of liver function as well as reduce ultrasonic evidence of fatty liver disease.<ref name=caballeria/><ref name=cacciatore/><ref name=shenov/>\n\n==Pharmacology==\n\n===Mechanism of action===\nMetadoxine is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]] and displays high affinity to the [[GABA transporter|gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter]]. ''In vitro'' enzymatic assay revealed that metadoxine reduced the activity of the [[GABA transaminase]] enzyme, responsible for the degradation of GABA. Electrophysiological studies also showed that metadoxine increased inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission via a presynaptic effect. As it does not affect dopamine, norepinephrine or serotonin levels, metadoxine displays a novel mechanism of action as a monoamine-independent GABA modulator.<ref name=alcobra/>\n\nIn animal studies, metadoxine increased the activity of [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzyme, prevented the decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase activity in chronic ethanol-fed rats, accelerated plasma and urinary clearance of ethanol, inhibited the increase of fatty acid esters in the liver of ethanol-treated rats, prevented the formation of [[fatty liver]] in rats exposed to a dose of ethanol sufficient to induce fatty liver, increased [[glutathione]] levels in the hepatocytes of acutely and chronically alcohol-intoxicated rats, prevented glutathione depletion, [[lipid peroxidation]] damage, collagen deposition, and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-\u03b1]] secretions induced by alcohol and acetaldehyde in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells.<ref name=addolorato/>\n\n==History==\nMetadoxine is predominantly used as metadoxine immediate release formulation in developing nations for acute alcohol intoxication and chronic alcoholic liver disease.

MDX has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple measures of cognition, ADHD symptoms, and quality of life, across multiple studies of adults with ADHD.<ref name=alcobra/>\n\nSeveral Phase II ADHD studies demonstrated a consistent signal of efficacy reaching statistical significance, as measured by neuropsychological testing (such as the computerized Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) in acute settings) and clinical scales (in chronic administration studies), with no treatment-related serious adverse events or major differences in adverse events profiles between drug and placebo groups.<ref name=manor/><ref name=manor2/> The most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, and headache.<ref name=manor/><ref name=manor2/> A phase 3 study in 300 adults with ADHD was completed in 2014.<ref name=weisler/>\n\nAlcobra Ltd., which was conducting the Phase III trial announced on January 17, 2017 that the drug had failed the trial.

name=addolorato/> Pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>) is a precursor of coenzymes including [[Pyridoxal phosphate|pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate]] (PLP), which accelerates the metabolic degradation of ethanol and prevents [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) inactivation by [[acetaldehyde]]. Pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes also play a role in the biosynthesis of four important neurotransmitters: [[serotonin]] (5-HT), [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]: see [[Vitamin B6#Functions|vitamin B<sub>6</sub> functions]]. L-PGA is present in the diet and is produced endogenously by enzymatic conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to L-PGA and free amino acids. In the central nervous system (CNS), L-PGA was found to have a role in composition of neuro-active molecules. Its production has been linked to hepatic gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Lastly, it was shown that L-PGA facilitates ATP synthesis by stimulating de novo synthesis of purines.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Medical uses==\nAs a treatment for alcohol intoxication and liver disease, metadoxine is typically given intravenously as immediate release formulation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Acute alcohol intoxication===\nIn clinical studies, metadoxine has been reported to reduce half-life of ethanol in healthy volunteers and in acutely intoxicated patients; to accelerate the metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde into less toxic higher ketones and to improve their urinary clearance; to restore laboratory variables such as alcohol, ammonia, [[Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase|\u03b3-GT]], and [[alanine aminotransferase]]; and to improve clinical symptoms of alcohol intoxication, including psychomotor agitation, depression, aggressiveness, and equilibrium disorders.<ref name=addolorato/><ref name=martinez/> There is also evidence that metadoxine has an effect on reducing craving for alcohol.<ref name=shpilenya/> Data from clinical studies also support an effect of metadoxine on reducing indices of liver cell necrosis and fat accumulation in alcoholic fatty liver.<ref name=shpilenya/>\n\n===Liver disease===\nMetadoxine may block the differentiation step of preadipocytes by inhibiting CREB phosphorylation and binding to the cAMP response element, thereby repressing CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b during hormone-induced adipogenesis.<ref name=yang/> Metadoxine, when given in an immediate release form in doses from 300&nbsp;mg twice a day to 500&nbsp;mg three times a day of up to 3 months, has been shown to improve biochemical indices of liver function as well as reduce ultrasonic evidence of fatty liver disease.<ref name=caballeria/><ref name=cacciatore/><ref name=shenov/>\n\n==Pharmacology==\n\n===Mechanism of action===\nMetadoxine is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]] and displays high affinity to the [[GABA transporter|gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter]]. ''In vitro'' enzymatic assay revealed that metadoxine reduced the activity of the [[GABA transaminase]] enzyme, responsible for the degradation of GABA. Electrophysiological studies also showed that metadoxine increased inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission via a presynaptic effect. As it does not affect dopamine, norepinephrine or serotonin levels, metadoxine displays a novel mechanism of action as a monoamine-independent GABA modulator.<ref name=alcobra/>\n\nIn animal studies, metadoxine increased the activity of [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzyme, prevented the decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase activity in chronic ethanol-fed rats, accelerated plasma and urinary clearance of ethanol, inhibited the increase of fatty acid esters in the liver of ethanol-treated rats, prevented the formation of [[fatty liver]] in rats exposed to a dose of ethanol sufficient to induce fatty liver, increased [[glutathione]] levels in the hepatocytes of acutely and chronically alcohol-intoxicated rats, prevented glutathione depletion, [[lipid peroxidation]] damage, collagen deposition, and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-\u03b1]] secretions induced by alcohol and acetaldehyde in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells.<ref name=addolorato/>\n\n==History==\nMetadoxine is predominantly used as metadoxine immediate release formulation in developing nations for acute alcohol intoxication and chronic alcoholic liver disease.

MDX has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple measures of cognition, ADHD symptoms, and quality of life, across multiple studies of adults with ADHD.<ref name=alcobra/>\n\nSeveral Phase II ADHD studies demonstrated a consistent signal of efficacy reaching statistical significance, as measured by neuropsychological testing (such as the computerized Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) in acute settings) and clinical scales (in chronic administration studies), with no treatment-related serious adverse events or major differences in adverse events profiles between drug and placebo groups.<ref name=manor/><ref name=manor2/> The most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, and headache.<ref name=manor/><ref name=manor2/> A phase 3 study in 300 adults with ADHD was completed in 2014.<ref name=weisler/>\n\nAlcobra Ltd., which was conducting the Phase III trial announced on January 17, 2017 that the drug had failed the trial. The failure announcement came a week after Alcobra won FDA agreement to review data collected to date in the MEASURE study and consider it in a future NDA submission of MDX for ADHD. The FDA also agreed to change a full clinical hold for the trial to a partial clinical hold pending review and approval of the company's proposed protocol for a 6-month, Phase I study to assess the potential relevance of adverse findings observed in long-term animal studies of metadoxine in relation to human exposure, Alcobra said.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228154420/https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/alcobra-adhd-candidate-mdx-fails-phase-iii-trial/81253721 | title=Alcobra ADHD Candidate MDX Fails Phase III Trial &#124; GEN}}</ref>\n\n===Fragile X syndrome===\n[[Fragile X syndrome]] (FXS) is a genetic disorder that is the most common single gene cause of intellectual disability and autism.<ref name=hersh/> Individuals with FXS often have a number of behavioral symptoms, including cognitive impairment, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, autistic symptoms, shyness, aggression, anxiety, hand flapping, hand biting, and a high sensitivity to being touched.<ref name=garber/><ref name=hagerman/> Autism spectrum disorder is seen in approximately 30% of males and 20% of females with FXS, and an additional 30% of FXS individuals display autistic symptoms without having the autism diagnosis.<ref name=hersh/> ADHD is commonly diagnosed in FXS and has been reported to occur in 59-80% of individuals with FXS.<ref name=hersh/><ref name=tranfaglia/>\n\nIn a FXS animal model (Fmr1 knockout mouse model), metadoxine treatment improved behavioral impairments of learning, memory, and social interaction and reversed the overactivation of the biomarkers [[Protein kinase B|Akt]] and [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK) in blood and brain of juvenile and adult mice.
