In Latin, the day was known as ''Iovis Dies'', \"Jupiter's Day\".  In Latin, the genitive or possessive case of Jupiter was ''Iovis''/''Jovis'' and thus in most Romance languages it became the word for Thursday: [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gioved\u00ec'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''jueves'', [[French language|French]] ''jeudi'', [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] j\u00f2via, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''dijous'', [[Galician language|Galician]] ''xoves'' and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''joi''. This is also reflected in the [[p-Celtic]] [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''dydd Iau''.\n\nThe [[astrological symbols|astrological]] and [[astronomical symbols|astronomical]] [[Jupiter (astrology)|sign of the planet Jupiter]] (\u2643[[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|50x25px|Jupiter]]) is sometimes used to represent Thursday.\n\nSince the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was identified with Thunor (Norse Thor in [[northern Europe]]), most Germanic languages name the day after this god: ''Torsdag'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''H\u00f3sdagur''/''T\u00f3rsdagur'' in [[Faroese language|Faroese]], ''Donnerstag'' in [[German language|German]]  or ''Donderdag'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Finnish and Northern Sami, both non-Germanic ([[Uralic languages|Uralic]]) languages, uses the borrowing \"Torstai\" and \"Duorastat\". In the extinct [[Polabian language|Polabian]] Slavic language, it was ''perundan'', [[Perun]] being the Slavic equivalent of Thor.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=db7iuvTX1bkC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=perundan+polabian&source=bl&ots=CEEoPmjoGO&sig=HoE8aDFAAXQrK7T_g786378kzgc&hl=en&ei=QuKHTsamGobmiALptfzHDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=perundan%20polabian&f=false |title=Selected writings: Comparative Slavic studies \u2013 Roman Jakobson \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of modern names imitating the naming of Thursday after an equivalent of \"Jupiter\" in local tradition. \nIn most of the [[languages of India]], the word for Thursday is ''Guruv\u0101ra'' \u2013 ''v\u0101ra'' meaning day and ''[[Guru]]'' being the [[style (manner of address)|style]] for [[B\u1e5bhaspati]], guru to the gods and regent of the planet [[Jupiter]]. In [[Sanskrit]] language, the day is called '''B\u1e5bhaspativ\u0101saram''' (day of [[B\u1e5bhaspati]]). In Nepali language, the day is called ''Bihiv\u0101ra'' as derived from the Sanskrit word. In [[Thai language|Thai]], the word is ''Wan Pharuehatsabodi'' , also in [[Old Javanese]] as ''Respati'' or in [[Balinese language|Balinese]] as ''Wraspati'' \u2013 referring to the Hindu deity B\u1e5bhaspati, also associated with Jupiter.\n[[En (Illyrian god)|En]] was an old [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] deity and in his honor in the [[Albanian language]] Thursday is called \"Enjte\".<ref>Lurker, Manfred. ''The Routledge Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons'', Taylor & Francis e-Library, 2005. p.57</ref> \nIn the [[Nahuatl language]], Thursday is {{lang|nci|Tezcatlipot\u014dnal}} ({{IPA-nah|teskat\u0361\u026cipo\u02c8to\u02d0na\u026c}}) meaning \"day of [[Tezcatlipoca]]\".\n\nIn Japanese, the day is {{lang|och|\u6728\u66dc\u65e5}} (\u6728 represents Jupiter, \u6728\u661f), following [[Names_of_the_days_of_the_week#East_Asian_tradition|East Asian tradition]].\n\n===Fourth day===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}\nIn [[Slavic languages]] and in Chinese, this day's name is \"fourth\" ([[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''\u0161tvrtok'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''\u010dtvrtek'', [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ''\u010detrtek'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] ''\u010detvrtak'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''czwartek'', [[Russian language|Russian]] \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0433 ''\u010detverg'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0442\u044a\u043a,  [[Serbian language|Serbian]] \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043a, [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043a, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440 ''\u010detver''.).

At the end of [[Divine Services]] on Thursday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure [[Theotokos|Mother]], of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our [[Holy Fathers|Father]] among the [[saint]]s Nicholas, [[Archbishop]] of [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], the [[Wonder-worker]]\u2026\"\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Thursday]] is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into [[Heaven]].\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islam]], Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do [[Fasting in Islam#Days of voluntary fasting|voluntary fasting]], the other being Mondays.
