She also has hobbies that are very un-feminine, such as [[Smoking in Japan|smoking]], being a fan of [[pro wrestling]], [[K-1]], and [[sh\u014dnen]] [[anime]].\n\nAfter her fianc\u00e9 leaves her for his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and Sumire is demoted at work, she stumbles across a young injured homeless man in a box outside her [[condominium]]. She takes him in and becomes attached to him. As a joke, she says she wants to keep him as a pet. To her surprise, the young man agrees. She names him {{Nihongo|Momo|\u30e2\u30e2|}}, after her beloved dog from childhood. Sumire provides room and board, and Momo provides unconditional love and loyalty. Sumire says there is no sex in their relationship, and she will only sleep with men who have the \"three highs\": higher pay, higher education and higher height (i.e. taller than her 170&nbsp;cm.) Despite this, there is definite [[sexual tension]] in their relationship.\n\nSumire later learns that Momo's real name is {{Nihongo|Takeshi Gouda|\u5408\u7530 \u6b66\u5fd7|G\u014dda Takeshi}}, and that he is a dance [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who studied classical [[ballet]] but was too short to take the lead roles. He switched to [[modern dance]], and lived a semi-homeless life before meeting Sumire.  When it is revealed that he and Sumire know one another, Momo passes himself off as Sumire's second cousin.\n\nComplications arise when Sumire is reunited with the man with whom she was infatuated during her time at [[Tokyo University]], {{Nihongo|Shigehito Hasumi|\u84ee\u5be6 \u6ecb\u4eba|Hasumi Shigehito}}.  Hasumi meets all of Sumire's requirements. However, Sumire cannot quite open up to Hasumi-[[senpai]], or give up her attachment to Momo. For example, Sumire lets Momo call her by her personal name, while she struggles to let Hasumi call her \"Iwaya\" instead of \"Iwaya-san.\"  Takeshi (a.k.a. Momo) starts to have feelings for Sumire as well and they began to have feelings that go way beyond those of a pet and its Master.\n\nWhen Hasumi meets Momo, he recognizes Momo's face but cannot put a name to him.  When Hasumi does some research on Iwaya-san's so-called cousin, he discovers that Takeshi was a child ballet prodigy and becomes friends with him. Takeshi, of course, has to keep the fact that he is also \"Momo\" to himself, even when Hasumi repeatedly brings up the topic of Sumire's pet in their conversations. Although, at times he changes personalities; something is up with Momo!\n\n==Development==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\nOriginally, Momo was meant to have a much more animal-like personality, and Ogawa considers him one of her easiest characters to draw, describing his character type as being one of her 'stock characters'.<ref name=Chronology>{{Cite book|last=Ogawa|first=Yayoi|title=Tramps Like Us|volume=14|chapter=The History of ''Tramps Like Us'' - Complete Chronology of ''Tramps''|ISBN=1-59816-876-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{Main|List of Tramps Like Us chapters}}\nThe chapters of ''Tramps Like Us'' were written and illustrated by [[Yayoi Ogawa]].

It is special in two aspects of farming and processing: the [http://www.zaysan.com/evidence-based-benefits-of-green-tea/ green tea] plants used for matcha are shade-grown for three to four weeks before harvest, and the stems and veins are removed during processing. During shaded growth, the plant ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' produces more [[theanine]] and [[caffeine]]. The powdered form of matcha is consumed differently than from tea leaves or tea bags, as it is suspended in a liquid, typically water or milk.\n\nThe traditional [[Japanese tea ceremony]] centers on the preparation, serving, and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and embodies a meditative spirituality. In modern times, matcha is also used to flavor and dye foods such as ''[[mochi]]'' and ''[[soba]]'' noodles, [[green tea ice cream]], matcha lattes, and a variety of Japanese ''[[wagashi]]'' confectionery. \nMatcha used in ceremonies is referred to as ceremonial-grade, meaning that the powder is of a high enough quality to be used in the tea ceremony. Lower-quality matcha is referred to as culinary-grade, but no standard industry definition or requirements exist for matcha.\n\nBlends of matcha are given poetic names known as ''[[chamei]]'' (\"tea names\") either by the producing plantation, shop, or creator of the blend, or by the grand master of a particular [[Schools of Japanese tea ceremony|tea tradition]]. When a blend is named by the grand master of a tea ceremony lineage, it becomes known as the master's ''konomi''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Powderedgreentea.jpg|thumb|A bowl of matcha on a black lacquered tray with ''[[wagashi]]'' (a traditional sweet)]]\nIn [[China]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907), tea leaves were steamed and formed into [[tea brick]]s for storage and trade.

In Japan, it became an important item at Zen monasteries and from the 14th through to the 16th centuries was highly appreciated by members of the upper echelons of society. Although powdered tea has not been popular in [[China]] for some time,  a global resurgence is now occurring in the consumption of matcha, including in China.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Matcha Beverage.jpg|thumb|M\u00f6bius cup with matcha]]\nMatcha is made from shade-grown tea leaves that also are used to make ''[[gyokuro]]''.

Only the finest tea buds are hand-picked. After harvesting, if the leaves are rolled up before drying as in the production of ''[[sencha]]'', the result will be ''gyokuro'' (jade dew) tea. If the leaves are laid out flat to dry, however, they will crumble somewhat and become known as ''tencha'' ({{lang|ja|\u78be\u8336}}).

Since the leaves' cell walls are still intact, brewing tencha tea results in a pale green brew, which has a more mellow taste compared to other green tea extracts, and only the highest grade of ''tencha ''leaves can brew to its fullest flavor. ''Tencha'' leaves are half the weight of other tea leaves such as '' gyokuro'' and ''sencha'', so most ''tencha'' brews require double the number of leaves. About an hour  is needed to grind 40 to 70 g of ''tencha'' leaves into matcha, and matcha does not retain its freshness as long as ''tencha'' in powder form because powder begins to oxidize. Drinking and brewing ''tencha'' is traditionally prohibited by the Japanese tea ceremony.<ref>{{|url=https://www.hibiki-an.com/contents.php/cnID/53|}}</ref>\n\n==Grades==\nCommercial considerations, especially outside Japan, have increasingly seen matcha marketed according to \"grades\", indicating quality.\n\nOf the following terms, \"ceremonial grade\" is not recognised in Japan; \"food grade\" or \"culinary grade\" certainly are.\n* '''Ceremonial grade''' supposedly designates tea of a quality sufficient for its use in tea ceremonies and Buddhist temples. Almost always ground into a powder by granite stone mills, it is expensive (around [[United States dollar|US$]]100\u2013140 for 100&nbsp;g). The unschooled drinker is unlikely to notice a large difference between ceremonial and premium grades. There is no distinct set of flavour characteristics designating the highest grade of matcha; some matchas are conspicuously sweet, some can be comparatively bitter with other characteristics to 'compensate'; the full suite of aesthetic properties such as flavour, colour, and texture are important in the grading of matcha. All must necessarily be of a quality that can support the making of koicha (\u6fc3\u8336), the \"thick tea\" with a high proportion of powder to water, since this is the form of tea that defines the traditional tea ceremony.\n* '''Premium grade''' is high-quality matcha green tea that contains young tea leaves from the top of the tea plant. Price point  is around US$50\u201380 for 100&nbsp;g. Best for daily consumption, it is characterized by a fresh, subtle flavor, usually perfect for both new and everyday matcha drinkers alike.\n* '''Cooking/culinary grade''' is the cheapest of all ($15\u201340 for 100&nbsp;g). Suitable for cooking purposes, smoothies etc. It is slightly bitter due to factors such as its production from leaves lower down on the tea plant, [[terroir]], the time of harvest, or the process of its manufacture.\n\nIn general, matcha is expensive compared to other forms of green tea, although its price depends on its quality. Higher grades are pricier due to the production methods and younger leaves used, and thus they have a more delicate flavour, and are more suited to be enjoyed as tea.\n\nLike other forms of green tea, all grades of matcha have the potential health benefits and risks associated with the ''Camellia sinensis'' plant (the human clinical evidence is still limited), while the nutrient content varies depending on climate, season, horticultural practices, plant variety, manufacturing methods and the age of the leaf, i.e., the position of the leaf on the harvested shoot. Catechin concentration is highly dependent on leaf age (the leaf bud and the first leaf are richest in epigallocatechin gallate), but catechin levels also vary greatly between plant varieties and whether the plants are grown in shade.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal |last1=Chacko |first1=Sabu M. |last2=Thambi |first2=Priya T. |last3=Kuttan |first3=Ramadasan |last4=Nishigaki |first4=Ikuo |title=Beneficial effects of green tea: A literature review |journal=Chinese Medicine |date=April 6, 2010 |volume=5; 2010 |pages=13 |doi=10.1186/1749-8546-5-13 |pmid=20370896 |pmc=2855614 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Wojciech |last2=Kukula-Koch |first2=Wirginia |last3=Komsta |first3=\u0141ukasz |last4=Marzec |first4=Zbigniew |last5=Szwerc |first5=Wojciech |last6=G\u0142owniak |first6=Kazimierz |title=Green Tea Quality Evaluation Based on Its Catechins and Metals Composition in Combination with Chemometric Analysis |journal=Molecules |date=July 11, 2018 |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=1689 |doi=10.3390/molecules23071689 |pmid=29997337 |pmc=6100455 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Graham |first1=Harold N. |title=Green tea composition, consumption, and polyphenol chemistry |journal=Preventive Medicine |date=May 1992 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=334\u2013350 |doi=10.1016/0091-7435(92)90041-F |pmid=1614995 }}</ref><ref name=\"Chemical Components of Matcha and P\">{{cite journal |last1=Horie |first1=Hideki |title=Chemical Components of Matcha and Powdered Green Tea |journal=Journal of Cookery Science of Japan |date=October 20, 2017 |volume=50 |issue=5 | pages=182\u2013188  |doi=10.11402/cookeryscience.50.182 }}</ref>\n\nChemical compositions of various grades of matcha were studied, with the results showing that the contents of caffeine, free amino acids, theanine, and vitamin C decreased with the decreasing price of matcha.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ikegaya |first1=Kenjiro |last2=Takayanagi |first2=Hirotsugu |last3=Anan |first3=Toyomasa |title=Chemical composition of Mat-cha |journal=Chagyo Kenkyu Hokoku (Tea Research Journal) |date=December 1, 1984 |volume=1984 |issue=60 |pages=79\u201381  |doi=10.5979/cha.1984.60_79 }}</ref>\n\nAnother study examined the chemical components of ''tencha'' (from which matcha is made), and showed that higher grade teas contained greater amounts of total amino acids, theanine, and other individual amino acids. On the other hand, the high grade teas contained lower amounts of total catechins than lower grade teas (epigallocatechin (EGC) and epicatechin (EC) contents were greater in lower grade teas, while those of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and  epicatechin gallate (ECG) did not seem to correlate with tea grade), with the conclusion that the EGCG/EGC ratio reflected the quality of matcha more effectively than the EGC or total catechin contents. The relationship between the grade of ''tencha'' and caffeine contents seemed low. The chlorophyll contents were greater in the higher grade teas with a few exceptions, likely related to the strong shading used to cultivate high quality ''tencha''.<ref name=\"Chemical Components of Matcha and P\"/>\n\nThe study also examined the chemical components of ceremonial grade matcha, industrial grade matcha (referring to powdered teas used in the food industry and cooking, and labelled matcha), and other powdered green tea samples (like ''sencha'' and ''gyokuro''). The prices of industrial matcha were \uff1e600 Yen/100g, and the prices of ceremonial matcha were \uff1e3,000 Yen/100g. On the other hand, prices of powdered green tea were \uff1c600 Yen/100. The prices ranged from 8,100 Yen/100g (ceremonial grade) to 170 Yen/100g (powdered ''sencha''). Samples of matcha for tea ceremonies were characterized by high contents of theanine (\uff1e1.8g/100g), and high ratios of EGCG/EGC(\uff1e3.2g/100g). On the other hand, for the industrial grade matcha samples and  powdered green teas, the theanine contents and EGCG/EGC ratios were \uff1c1.7g/100g and \uff1c3.3g/100g, respectively. The contents of chlorophyll of matcha for tea ceremonies were \uff1e250&nbsp;mg/100g, and of most of the other samples were \uff1c260&nbsp;mg/100g.

The young developing leaves on the top of the plant, that are soft and supple, are used for higher grades of matcha, resulting in a finer texture and flavour. For the lower grades, older more developed leaves are used, giving them a sandy texture and slightly bitter flavour.\n\n===Treatment before processing===\nTraditionally, ''sencha'' leaves are dried outside in the shade and never are exposed to direct sunlight; however, now drying mostly has moved indoors.

Matcha exposed to oxygen may easily become compromised. Oxidized matcha has a distinctive hay-like smell and a dull brownish-green colour.\n\n==Traditional preparation==\n[[File:2007 06 19 Maria Kaczynska 07.jpg|thumb|A three-piece set for making matcha, including a whisk (''chasen''), bowl (''chawan''), and spoon (''chashaku'')]]\nThe two main ways of preparing matcha are {{nihongo|thin|\u8584\u8336|usucha}} and the less common {{nihongo|thick|\u6fc3\u8336|koicha}}.\n\nPrior to use, the matcha often is forced through a [[sieve]] to break up clumps. Special sieves are available for this purpose, which usually are stainless steel and combine a fine wire-mesh sieve and a temporary storage container. A special wooden [[spatula]] is used to force the tea through the sieve, or a small, smooth stone may be placed on top of the sieve and the device shaken gently.\n\nIf the sieved matcha is to be served at a [[Japanese tea ceremony]], then it will be placed into a small tea caddy known as a [[chaki]]. Otherwise, it can be scooped directly from the sieve into a [[chawan]].\n\nAbout 2-4 g of matcha are placed into the bowl, traditionally using a bamboo scoop called a ''chashaku'', and then about 60\u201380&nbsp;ml of hot water are added.\n\nWhile other fine Japanese teas such as [[gyokuro]] are prepared using water cooled as low as 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, in Japan matcha is commonly prepared with water just below the boiling point,<ref>http://www.kyoto-teramachi.or.jp/horaido/Matchapage/Matcha.htm</ref> although temperatures as low as 70\u201385&nbsp;\u00b0C or 158\u2013185&nbsp;\u00b0F are similarly recommended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marukyu-koyamaen.co.jp/english/enjoy/maccha.html|title=Preparation of Matcha|publisher=Marukyu-Koyamaen|access-date=7 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102162924/http://www.marukyu-koyamaen.co.jp/english/enjoy/maccha.html|archive-date=2 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe mixture of water and tea powder is whisked to a uniform consistency, using a bamboo whisk known as a ''chasen''.

''Usucha'' creates a lighter and slightly more bitter tea.\n\n''Koicha'', or thick tea, requires significantly more'' matcha'' (usually about doubling the powder and halving the water): about 3.75&nbsp;g (amounting to 3 heaping ''chashaku'' scoops, or about one teaspoon) of ''matcha and'' 40&nbsp;ml (1.3&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz) of hot water per serving, or as many as 6 teaspoons to {{3/4}} cup of water. Because the resulting mixture is significantly thicker (with a similar consistency to liquid [[honey]]), blending it requires a slower, stirring motion that does not produce foam. ''Koicha'' is normally made with more expensive matcha from older tea trees (exceeding 30 years), thus, produces a milder and sweeter tea than ''usucha''; it is served almost exclusively as part of Japanese tea ceremonies.\n\n==Other uses==\nIt is used in ''[[Kasutera|castella]], [[manj\u016b]]'', and ''[[monaka]]''; as a topping for shaved ice (''[[kakig\u014dri]]''); mixed with milk and sugar as a drink; and mixed with salt and used to flavour [[tempura]] in a mixture known as ''matcha-jio''. It is also used as flavouring in many Western-style [[chocolate]]s, [[candy]], and [[dessert]]s, such as cakes and pastries, including [[Swiss roll]]s and [[cheesecake]], [[cookies]], [[pudding]], [[mousse]], and [[green tea ice cream]]. Matcha [[frozen yogurt]] is sold in shops and can be made at home using [[Greek Yogurt|Greek yogurt]].

It is special in two aspects of farming and processing: the green tea plants used for matcha are shade-grown for three to four weeks before harvest, and the stems and veins are removed during processing. During shaded growth, the plant ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' produces more [[theanine]] and [[caffeine]]. The powdered form of matcha is consumed differently than from tea leaves or tea bags, as it is suspended in a liquid, typically water or milk.\n\nThe traditional [[Japanese tea ceremony]] centers on the preparation, serving, and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and embodies a meditative spirituality. In modern times, matcha is also used to flavor and dye foods such as ''[[mochi]]'' and ''[[soba]]'' noodles, [[green tea ice cream]], matcha lattes, and a variety of Japanese ''[[wagashi]]'' confectionery. \nMatcha used in ceremonies is referred to as ceremonial-grade, meaning that the powder is of a high enough quality to be used in the tea ceremony. Lower-quality matcha is referred to as culinary-grade, but no standard industry definition or requirements exist for matcha.\n\nBlends of matcha are given poetic names known as ''[[chamei]]'' (\"tea names\") either by the producing plantation, shop, or creator of the blend, or by the grand master of a particular [[Schools of Japanese tea ceremony|tea tradition]]. When a blend is named by the grand master of a tea ceremony lineage, it becomes known as the master's ''konomi''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Powderedgreentea.jpg|thumb|A bowl of matcha on a black lacquered tray with ''[[wagashi]]'' (a traditional sweet)]]\nIn [[China]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907), tea leaves were steamed and formed into [[tea brick]]s for storage and trade. The tea was prepared by roasting and pulverizing the tea, and [[Decoction|decocting]] the resulting tea powder in hot water, then adding salt.<ref>Han Wei, \"Tang Dynasty Tea Utensils and Tea Culture: Recent Discoveries at Famen Temple\", in ''Chanoyu Quarterly'' no. 74 (1993)</ref> During the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), the method of making powdered tea from steam-prepared dried tea leaves, and preparing the beverage by whipping the tea powder and hot water together in a bowl became popular.<ref name = \"Hiroichi\">Tsutsui Hiroichi, \"Tea-drinking Customs in Japan\", paper in ''Seminar Papers: The 4th International Tea Culture Festival''.

In Japan, it became an important item at Zen monasteries and from the 14th through to the 16th centuries was highly appreciated by members of the upper echelons of society. Although powdered tea has not been popular in [[China]] for some time,  a global resurgence is now occurring in the consumption of matcha, including in China.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Matcha Beverage.jpg|thumb|M\u00f6bius cup with matcha]]\nMatcha is made from shade-grown tea leaves that also are used to make ''[[gyokuro]]''. The preparation of matcha starts several weeks before harvest and may last up to 20 days, when the [[tea]] bushes are covered to prevent direct sunlight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.artoftea.com/2012/06/01/matcha-green-tea/|title=A Matcha Highlight Part One: Harvesting Grade A Matcha|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=9 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909233326/http://blog.artoftea.com/2012/06/01/matcha-green-tea/|archive-date=9 September 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{Better source|date=January 2020}} This slows down growth, stimulates an increase in chlorophyll levels, turns the leaves a darker shade of green, and causes the production of [[amino acid]]s, in particular [[theanine]]. Only the finest tea buds are hand-picked. After harvesting, if the leaves are rolled up before drying as in the production of ''[[sencha]]'', the result will be ''gyokuro'' (jade dew) tea. If the leaves are laid out flat to dry, however, they will crumble somewhat and become known as ''tencha'' ({{lang|ja|\u78be\u8336}}).

Since the leaves' cell walls are still intact, brewing tencha tea results in a pale green brew, which has a more mellow taste compared to other green tea extracts, and only the highest grade of ''tencha ''leaves can brew to its fullest flavor. ''Tencha'' leaves are half the weight of other tea leaves such as '' gyokuro'' and ''sencha'', so most ''tencha'' brews require double the number of leaves. About an hour  is needed to grind 40 to 70 g of ''tencha'' leaves into matcha, and matcha does not retain its freshness as long as ''tencha'' in powder form because powder begins to oxidize. Drinking and brewing ''tencha'' is traditionally prohibited by the Japanese tea ceremony.<ref>{{|url=https://www.hibiki-an.com/contents.php/cnID/53|}}</ref>\n\n==Grades==\nCommercial considerations, especially outside Japan, have increasingly seen matcha marketed according to \"grades\", indicating quality.\n\nOf the following terms, \"ceremonial grade\" is not recognised in Japan; \"food grade\" or \"culinary grade\" certainly are.\n* '''Ceremonial grade''' supposedly designates tea of a quality sufficient for its use in tea ceremonies and Buddhist temples. Almost always ground into a powder by granite stone mills, it is expensive (around [[United States dollar|US$]]100\u2013140 for 100&nbsp;g). The unschooled drinker is unlikely to notice a large difference between ceremonial and premium grades. There is no distinct set of flavour characteristics designating the highest grade of matcha; some matchas are conspicuously sweet, some can be comparatively bitter with other characteristics to 'compensate'; the full suite of aesthetic properties such as flavour, colour, and texture are important in the grading of matcha. All must necessarily be of a quality that can support the making of koicha (\u6fc3\u8336), the \"thick tea\" with a high proportion of powder to water, since this is the form of tea that defines the traditional tea ceremony.\n* '''Premium grade''' is high-quality matcha green tea that contains young tea leaves from the top of the tea plant. Price point  is around US$50\u201380 for 100&nbsp;g. Best for daily consumption, it is characterized by a fresh, subtle flavor, usually perfect for both new and everyday matcha drinkers alike.\n* '''Cooking/culinary grade''' is the cheapest of all ($15\u201340 for 100&nbsp;g). Suitable for cooking purposes, smoothies etc. It is slightly bitter due to factors such as its production from leaves lower down on the tea plant, [[terroir]], the time of harvest, or the process of its manufacture.\n\nIn general, matcha is expensive compared to other forms of green tea, although its price depends on its quality. Higher grades are pricier due to the production methods and younger leaves used, and thus they have a more delicate flavour, and are more suited to be enjoyed as tea.\n\nLike other forms of green tea, all grades of matcha have the potential health benefits and risks associated with the ''Camellia sinensis'' plant (the human clinical evidence is still limited), while the nutrient content varies depending on climate, season, horticultural practices, plant variety, manufacturing methods and the age of the leaf, i.e., the position of the leaf on the harvested shoot. Catechin concentration is highly dependent on leaf age (the leaf bud and the first leaf are richest in epigallocatechin gallate), but catechin levels also vary greatly between plant varieties and whether the plants are grown in shade.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal |last1=Chacko |first1=Sabu M. |last2=Thambi |first2=Priya T. |last3=Kuttan |first3=Ramadasan |last4=Nishigaki |first4=Ikuo |title=Beneficial effects of green tea: A literature review |journal=Chinese Medicine |date=April 6, 2010 |volume=5; 2010 |pages=13 |doi=10.1186/1749-8546-5-13 |pmid=20370896 |pmc=2855614 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Koch |first1=Wojciech |last2=Kukula-Koch |first2=Wirginia |last3=Komsta |first3=\u0141ukasz |last4=Marzec |first4=Zbigniew |last5=Szwerc |first5=Wojciech |last6=G\u0142owniak |first6=Kazimierz |title=Green Tea Quality Evaluation Based on Its Catechins and Metals Composition in Combination with Chemometric Analysis |journal=Molecules |date=July 11, 2018 |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=1689 |doi=10.3390/molecules23071689 |pmid=29997337 |pmc=6100455 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Graham |first1=Harold N. |title=Green tea composition, consumption, and polyphenol chemistry |journal=Preventive Medicine |date=May 1992 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=334\u2013350 |doi=10.1016/0091-7435(92)90041-F |pmid=1614995 }}</ref><ref name=\"Chemical Components of Matcha and P\">{{cite journal |last1=Horie |first1=Hideki |title=Chemical Components of Matcha and Powdered Green Tea |journal=Journal of Cookery Science of Japan |date=October 20, 2017 |volume=50 |issue=5 | pages=182\u2013188  |doi=10.11402/cookeryscience.50.182 }}</ref>\n\nChemical compositions of various grades of matcha were studied, with the results showing that the contents of caffeine, free amino acids, theanine, and vitamin C decreased with the decreasing price of matcha.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ikegaya |first1=Kenjiro |last2=Takayanagi |first2=Hirotsugu |last3=Anan |first3=Toyomasa |title=Chemical composition of Mat-cha |journal=Chagyo Kenkyu Hokoku (Tea Research Journal) |date=December 1, 1984 |volume=1984 |issue=60 |pages=79\u201381  |doi=10.5979/cha.1984.60_79 }}</ref>\n\nAnother study examined the chemical components of ''tencha'' (from which matcha is made), and showed that higher grade teas contained greater amounts of total amino acids, theanine, and other individual amino acids. On the other hand, the high grade teas contained lower amounts of total catechins than lower grade teas (epigallocatechin (EGC) and epicatechin (EC) contents were greater in lower grade teas, while those of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and  epicatechin gallate (ECG) did not seem to correlate with tea grade), with the conclusion that the EGCG/EGC ratio reflected the quality of matcha more effectively than the EGC or total catechin contents. The relationship between the grade of ''tencha'' and caffeine contents seemed low. The chlorophyll contents were greater in the higher grade teas with a few exceptions, likely related to the strong shading used to cultivate high quality ''tencha''.<ref name=\"Chemical Components of Matcha and P\"/>\n\nThe study also examined the chemical components of ceremonial grade matcha, industrial grade matcha (referring to powdered teas used in the food industry and cooking, and labelled matcha), and other powdered green tea samples (like ''sencha'' and ''gyokuro''). The prices of industrial matcha were \uff1e600 Yen/100g, and the prices of ceremonial matcha were \uff1e3,000 Yen/100g. On the other hand, prices of powdered green tea were \uff1c600 Yen/100. The prices ranged from 8,100 Yen/100g (ceremonial grade) to 170 Yen/100g (powdered ''sencha''). Samples of matcha for tea ceremonies were characterized by high contents of theanine (\uff1e1.8g/100g), and high ratios of EGCG/EGC(\uff1e3.2g/100g). On the other hand, for the industrial grade matcha samples and  powdered green teas, the theanine contents and EGCG/EGC ratios were \uff1c1.7g/100g and \uff1c3.3g/100g, respectively. The contents of chlorophyll of matcha for tea ceremonies were \uff1e250&nbsp;mg/100g, and of most of the other samples were \uff1c260&nbsp;mg/100g. Although no difference was found between the theanine contents and EGCG/EGC ratios of industrial grade matcha and powdered green teas, the chlorophyll contents in industrial grade matcha tended to be higher than those of powdered green tea.<ref name=\"Chemical Components of Matcha and P\"/>\n\n===Location on the tea bush===\nWhere leaves destined for ''tencha ''are picked on the tea bush is vital for different grades of matcha. The young developing leaves on the top of the plant, that are soft and supple, are used for higher grades of matcha, resulting in a finer texture and flavour. For the lower grades, older more developed leaves are used, giving them a sandy texture and slightly bitter flavour.\n\n===Treatment before processing===\nTraditionally, ''sencha'' leaves are dried outside in the shade and never are exposed to direct sunlight; however, now drying mostly has moved indoors.

Matcha exposed to oxygen may easily become compromised. Oxidized matcha has a distinctive hay-like smell and a dull brownish-green colour.\n\n==Traditional preparation==\n[[File:2007 06 19 Maria Kaczynska 07.jpg|thumb|A three-piece set for making matcha, including a whisk (''chasen''), bowl (''chawan''), and spoon (''chashaku'')]]\nThe two main ways of preparing matcha are {{nihongo|thin|\u8584\u8336|usucha}} and the less common {{nihongo|thick|\u6fc3\u8336|koicha}}.\n\nPrior to use, the matcha often is forced through a [[sieve]] to break up clumps. Special sieves are available for this purpose, which usually are stainless steel and combine a fine wire-mesh sieve and a temporary storage container. A special wooden [[spatula]] is used to force the tea through the sieve, or a small, smooth stone may be placed on top of the sieve and the device shaken gently.\n\nIf the sieved matcha is to be served at a [[Japanese tea ceremony]], then it will be placed into a small tea caddy known as a [[chaki]]. Otherwise, it can be scooped directly from the sieve into a [[chawan]].\n\nAbout 2-4 g of matcha are placed into the bowl, traditionally using a bamboo scoop called a ''chashaku'', and then about 60\u201380&nbsp;ml of hot water are added.\n\nWhile other fine Japanese teas such as [[gyokuro]] are prepared using water cooled as low as 40&nbsp;\u00b0C, in Japan matcha is commonly prepared with water just below the boiling point,<ref>http://www.kyoto-teramachi.or.jp/horaido/Matchapage/Matcha.htm</ref> although temperatures as low as 70\u201385&nbsp;\u00b0C or 158\u2013185&nbsp;\u00b0F are similarly recommended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marukyu-koyamaen.co.jp/english/enjoy/maccha.html|title=Preparation of Matcha|publisher=Marukyu-Koyamaen|access-date=7 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102162924/http://www.marukyu-koyamaen.co.jp/english/enjoy/maccha.html|archive-date=2 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe mixture of water and tea powder is whisked to a uniform consistency, using a bamboo whisk known as a ''chasen''.

Because the resulting mixture is significantly thicker (with a similar consistency to liquid [[honey]]), blending it requires a slower, stirring motion that does not produce foam. ''Koicha'' is normally made with more expensive matcha from older tea trees (exceeding 30 years), thus, produces a milder and sweeter tea than ''usucha''; it is served almost exclusively as part of Japanese tea ceremonies.\n\n==Other uses==\nIt is used in ''[[Kasutera|castella]], [[manj\u016b]]'', and ''[[monaka]]''; as a topping for shaved ice (''[[kakig\u014dri]]''); mixed with milk and sugar as a drink; and mixed with salt and used to flavour [[tempura]] in a mixture known as ''matcha-jio''. It is also used as flavouring in many Western-style [[chocolate]]s, [[candy]], and [[dessert]]s, such as cakes and pastries, including [[Swiss roll]]s and [[cheesecake]], [[cookies]], [[pudding]], [[mousse]], and [[green tea ice cream]]. Matcha [[frozen yogurt]] is sold in shops and can be made at home using [[Greek Yogurt|Greek yogurt]].

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus,<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince and his father, Arrybas, ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged King Neoptolemus.</ref> and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacides was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias' wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC, Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=14}}; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the [[Peloponnese]] and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=14\u201317}}.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000-25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=37}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch. ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch. ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful.

Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of [[Lucanians|Lucania]], the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in [[Italy]]. He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch.

He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest [[Campania]] from the Romans, but was twarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled [[Tiberius Coruncanius]], the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from [[Etruria]] towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north. Not wanting to be caught between three armies Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum, where he wintered his troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=75\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Pyrrhus invaded [[Apulia]] (279 BC), the two armies met in the [[Battle of Asculum]], where Pyrrhus won a costly victory.<ref name=encarta2008/> The consul [[Publius Decius Mus (279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus' Epirot army, which guaranteed the security of the city itself. In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\">Plutarch. ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#21 21.9].</ref> It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term [[Pyrrhic victory]] originates.\n\n==Ruler of Sicily==\nIn 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. The city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.\n\n==Last wars and death==\n{{Main|Siege of Sparta|}}\n[[File:The-Siege-Of-Sparta-By-Pyrrhus-319-272-Bc-1799-1800.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Sparta]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Topino-Lebrun]]]]\n\nHis western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again.<ref>The easiest way for a king to raise funds was to invade his neighbours.</ref> The realm of his rival king [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=125\u2013128}}; Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 26.</ref>\n\nAntigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities.<ref>He had inherited a powerful navy from his father, Demetrius.</ref> He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=128}}.</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian. ''History of the Syrian Wars'', [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html \u00a710] and [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_03.html \u00a711].</ref> While he was a mercurial and often restless leader, and not always a wise king, he was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time. \n\nPyrrhus was known for his benevolence. As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]]. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born.<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\">{{harvnb|Bennett|2010}}.</ref> His second wife was [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], daughter of King [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] (r. 317\u2013289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\"/> and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus. His third wife was the daughter of [[Audoleon]], King of [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]]; his fourth wife was the Illyrian princess [[Bircenna]], who was the daughter of King [[Bardylis II]] (r. c. 295\u2013290 BC); and his fifth wife was the daughter of [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], whom he married in 281/280 BC.

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus,<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince and his father, Arrybas, ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged King Neoptolemus.</ref> and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacides was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias' wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC, Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=14}}; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the [[Peloponnese]] and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=14\u201317}}.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000-25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=37}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch. ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch. ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius, \"Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=37\u201339}}; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius.

Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in [[Italy]]. He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch.

He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest [[Campania]] from the Romans, but was twarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled [[Tiberius Coruncanius]], the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from [[Etruria]] towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north. Not wanting to be caught between three armies Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum, where he wintered his troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=75\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Pyrrhus invaded [[Apulia]] (279 BC), the two armies met in the [[Battle of Asculum]], where Pyrrhus won a costly victory.<ref name=encarta2008/> The consul [[Publius Decius Mus (279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus' Epirot army, which guaranteed the security of the city itself.

The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. The city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.\n\n==Last wars and death==\n{{Main|Siege of Sparta|}}\n[[File:The-Siege-Of-Sparta-By-Pyrrhus-319-272-Bc-1799-1800.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Sparta]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Topino-Lebrun]]]]\n\nHis western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again.<ref>The easiest way for a king to raise funds was to invade his neighbours.</ref> The realm of his rival king [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=125\u2013128}}; Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 26.</ref>\n\nAntigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities.<ref>He had inherited a powerful navy from his father, Demetrius.</ref> He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=128}}.</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian. ''History of the Syrian Wars'', [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html \u00a710] and [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_03.html \u00a711].</ref> While he was a mercurial and often restless leader, and not always a wise king, he was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time. \n\nPyrrhus was known for his benevolence. As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]]. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born.<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\">{{harvnb|Bennett|2010}}.</ref> His second wife was [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], daughter of King [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] (r. 317\u2013289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\"/> and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus. His third wife was the daughter of [[Audoleon]], King of [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]]; his fourth wife was the Illyrian princess [[Bircenna]], who was the daughter of King [[Bardylis II]] (r. c. 295\u2013290 BC); and his fifth wife was the daughter of [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], whom he married in 281/280 BC.
