[[Willesden Junction tube station|Willesden Junction]], [[Kensal Green station|Kensal Green]] and [[Harlesden station|Harlesden]] stations all had an effect on the developing village. Cottages for railway and industrial workers were built, as was grander housing for the local [[middle class]].\n\nHarlesden increasingly lost its rural nature, with factories replacing farms and woodland. From late Victorian times until the 1930s, housing completed its spread across the area, and Harlesden became part of the London conurbation. Mainly after [[World War I]], one of Europe's biggest [[Industrial park|industrial estates]] was constructed at nearby [[Park Royal]], and large factories there included [[McVitie's|McVitie & Price]] (later [[United Biscuits]]) from 1910, and [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] from 1919.\n\nAt 6am, January 16 1939, the [[Irish Republican Army]] blew up the Harlesden electricity cable bridge.  The bridge crossed the [[Grand Junction Canal]], and carried the power line from [[Battersea Power Station]].  No one was injured in the attack.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Harlesden Explosion|date=16 January 1939|work=Coventry Evening Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nThe wedding cake for the Queen and Prince Philip, who were married in 1947, was baked at McVitie's Factory in Harlesden.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Hours to bake|last=|first=|date=15 November 1947|work=Daily Mirror|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harlesden High Street - geograph.org.uk - 1160179.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Harlesden High Street, with the red Jubilee Clock]]\nThe image of Harlesden today began to take shape in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

It was followed by ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'' on March 2, 2015.\n\n==Gameplay==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fnafrobots.jpg|thumb|right|The camera showing the Show Stage, highlighting (from left to right) Toy Bonnie, Toy Freddy, and Toy Chica.]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fnaf2lights.jpg|thumb|right|The player's office with the left air vent light activated.]] -->\nSimilar to the first game, ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'' is a [[survival horror]] video game with [[Adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click]] elements. Players must survive a night shift at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant (a [[pastiche]] of [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]]) from 12 A.M. to 6 A.M. game time (approximately seven minutes and six seconds), without being attacked by any of the [[Animatronics|animatronic]] enemy characters that wander from room to room. There are multiple different animatronic characters: the original game's antagonists: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunnie, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate, and Golden Freddy, as well as toy versions of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy (referred to as \"Mangle\"), the [[Marionette]] (often referred to as \"The Puppet\"), and a humanoid robot named \"Balloon Boy\".\n\nMuch like the first game, the player cannot leave the office but can track the animatronics' movements via a network of [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] placed throughout the building. The office has three entrances (a hallway and two side air vents); in a departure from the previous game, none of these can be sealed off to prevent enemies from entering. Each vent is equipped with a light that can be used to check for any characters that are about to crawl into the office. Players are given a wearable Freddy Fazbear mask to ward off approaching animatronics; however, this strategy will not work on certain characters, who must be repelled by other means. A flashlight is also available, used to check the hallway and darkened areas of the camera feeds, as well as to reset Foxy via strobing. Unlike the previous title, the power supply for the cameras and vent lights is unlimited, but the flashlight has a limited battery life; if it runs out, the player becomes vulnerable to attack. In addition, a music box has been placed in one room and must be remotely wound up through the camera interface, to avoid being attacked by the Marionette, who appears when the music stops. Failure to defend oneself from the animatronics will result in a [[jump scare|jumpscare]].\n\nUnlike the first game, after the player is killed, there is a chance that, rather than the Game Over screen, one of four [[8-bit]] [[minigame]]s will appear with instructions given at the start of each. These minigames contain insight into the plot of the game.\n\nThe game consists of five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] referred to as \"nights\", increasing in difficulty. Completing all five adds a star to the title screen and unlocks an even more difficult sixth night, which in turn adds a second star and unlocks a \"Custom Night\" upon completing the night. In the Custom Night, the player can adjust the AI difficulty of the individual animatronics (0 to 20) or play one of ten pre-set challenges. Completing Custom Night with every animatronic set to 20 results in adding the final star to the title screen.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Information in this section must be reliably sourced and not speculation by the fandom.

''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 5 completion cheque.</ref> As he did in the previous game, a certain Freddy Fazbear's Pizza employee calls Jeremy on the phone in the office at the beginning of each night to explain both gameplay and parts of the backstory surrounding the restaurant. He explains that the new animatronics, which have special [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] software and access to a criminal database in order to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; when things go silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest source of noise to find people to entertain, which happens to be the office.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Scene: Night 1.</ref>\n\nAs in the previous game, the animatronics' programming tells them that there should not be people in the restaurant after hours, so when they encounter Jeremy, they believe he is an animatronic endoskeleton without a costume and will attempt to stuff him into a spare Freddy Fazbear suit, killing him in the process.<ref name=\":4\">Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Scene: Night 1 phone call.</ref> The employee explains that this restaurant has an unlimited power source at night, unlike the previous location, but there are no doors blocking access to the office, requiring the player to use a spare Freddy Fazbear head to trick the animatronics into thinking he is not an endoskeleton; he gives additional tips to help the player survive their shift.<ref name=\":4\" /> As more enemy characters appear as the game progresses, the employee informs Jeremy of their presence, their movement patterns, and some background information on their presence in the game.<ref>FNaF 2 Phone calls.</ref> For example, he explains that the older animatronics are in the new restaurant, and have been retrofitted with the new technology, but as the company opted to redesign the characters, they are kept for spare parts.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 2.</ref>\n\nAs the game progresses, it is hinted that something is going on during the day, as the man on the phone mentions that rumors are going around and, later, that a police investigation is going on regarding the restaurant. [[Atari 2600|Atari]]-styled [[minigame]]s reveal that the restaurant has had a troubled past, as it was the location of a [[mass murder]] in which at least five children were murdered, with the culprit frequently appearing as a nameless purple figure (though later installments would give him the name William Afton).<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 4.</ref> On the game's fifth night, Jeremy is informed by the employee that the restaurant has been put on lockdown due to an unspecified event, but which is in place to make sure no employees, present or former, can enter or leave. The man also mentions that the position of the restaurant's day shift security has a vacancy and Jeremy may be promoted to it, and that the owner of Fredbear's Family Diner (a restaurant preceding Freddy Fazbear's Pizza) will be contacted for more information on the incident. Notably, the check the player receives at the end of Night 5 is dated 1987, thereby establishing the game as a [[prequel]] to the original.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Scene: Night 5.</ref>\n\nOn the sixth night, the man on the phone informs Jeremy that the restaurant has been shut down for undisclosed reasons, although he mentions the use of a \"spare yellow suit\" and an issue of the animatronics not functioning properly.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 6.</ref> He also says that he will be taking over as night shift security guard when the restaurant reopens. If Jeremy is successful in surviving the sixth night, he is promoted to day shift to cover a birthday party the next day to make sure the animatronics do not cause any problems. A newspaper that is shown in the winning screen of the sixth night says that the restaurant will close down and the new animatronics will be scrapped; however, the older ones will be saved for when the restaurant reopens, hinting at the events of the first game.\n\nOn the seventh night (Custom Night), the player acts as a new character named Fritz Smith due to Jeremy's promotion. Upon completing Custom Night, Fritz is fired for tampering with the animatronics and odor, a callback to the first game's Custom Night completion screen.\n\n== Development ==\nShortly after the release of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'', developer Cawthon began to confirm rumors of a sequel to the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://games.mxdwn.com/news/sequel-to-five-nights-at-freddys-on-the-way/|title=Sequel to \u2018Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u2019 On The Way  {{!}}   mxdwn Games|website=games.mxdwn.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2017}}</ref> Just one month after the original game's release, Cawthon posted a teaser of a sequel on his webpage, and continued to post teasers until the game's release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-game-five-nights-at-freddys-teases-sequel/1100-6422310/|title=Horror Game Five Nights at Freddy's Teases Sequel|work=GameSpot|access-date=April 25, 2017|language=en}}</ref> A trailer for the game was released in October 2014.

It was followed by ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'' on March 2, 2015.\n\n==Gameplay==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fnafrobots.jpg|thumb|right|The camera showing the Show Stage, highlighting (from left to right) Toy Bonnie, Toy Freddy, and Toy Chica.]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fnaf2lights.jpg|thumb|right|The player's office with the left air vent light activated.]] -->\nSimilar to the first game, ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'' is a [[survival horror]] video game with [[Adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click]] elements. Players must survive a night shift at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant (a [[pastiche]] of [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]]) from 12 A.M. to 6 A.M. game time (approximately seven minutes and six seconds), without being attacked by any of the [[Animatronics|animatronic]] enemy characters that wander from room to room. There are multiple different animatronic characters: the original game's antagonists: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunnie, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate, and Golden Freddy, as well as toy versions of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy (referred to as \"Mangle\"), the [[Marionette]] (often referred to as \"The Puppet\"), and a humanoid robot named \"Balloon Boy\".\n\nMuch like the first game, the player cannot leave the office but can track the animatronics' movements via a network of [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] placed throughout the building. The office has three entrances (a hallway and two side air vents); in a departure from the previous game, none of these can be sealed off to prevent enemies from entering. Each vent is equipped with a light that can be used to check for any characters that are about to crawl into the office. Players are given a wearable Freddy Fazbear mask to ward off approaching animatronics; however, this strategy will not work on certain characters, who must be repelled by other means. A flashlight is also available, used to check the hallway and darkened areas of the camera feeds, as well as to reset Foxy via strobing. Unlike the previous title, the power supply for the cameras and vent lights is unlimited, but the flashlight has a limited battery life; if it runs out, the player becomes vulnerable to attack. In addition, a music box has been placed in one room and must be remotely wound up through the camera interface, to avoid being attacked by the Marionette, who appears when the music stops. Failure to defend oneself from the animatronics will result in a [[jump scare|jumpscare]].\n\nUnlike the first game, after the player is killed, there is a chance that, rather than the Game Over screen, one of four [[8-bit]] [[minigame]]s will appear with instructions given at the start of each. These minigames contain insight into the plot of the game.\n\nThe game consists of five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] referred to as \"nights\", increasing in difficulty. Completing all five adds a star to the title screen and unlocks an even more difficult sixth night, which in turn adds a second star and unlocks a \"Custom Night\" upon completing the night. In the Custom Night, the player can adjust the AI difficulty of the individual animatronics (0 to 20) or play one of ten pre-set challenges. Completing Custom Night with every animatronic set to 20 results in adding the final star to the title screen.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Information in this section must be reliably sourced and not speculation by the fandom.

''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 5 completion cheque.</ref> As he did in the previous game, a certain Freddy Fazbear's Pizza employee calls Jeremy on the phone in the office at the beginning of each night to explain both gameplay and parts of the backstory surrounding the restaurant. He explains that the new animatronics, which have special [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] software and access to a criminal database in order to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; when things go silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest source of noise to find people to entertain, which happens to be the office.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Scene: Night 1.</ref>\n\nAs in the previous game, the animatronics' programming tells them that there should not be people in the restaurant after hours, so when they encounter Jeremy, they believe he is an animatronic endoskeleton without a costume and will attempt to stuff him into a spare Freddy Fazbear suit, killing him in the process.<ref name=\":4\">Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Scene: Night 1 phone call.</ref> The employee explains that this restaurant has an unlimited power source at night, unlike the previous location, but there are no doors blocking access to the office, requiring the player to use a spare Freddy Fazbear head to trick the animatronics into thinking he is not an endoskeleton; he gives additional tips to help the player survive their shift.<ref name=\":4\" /> As more enemy characters appear as the game progresses, the employee informs Jeremy of their presence, their movement patterns, and some background information on their presence in the game.<ref>FNaF 2 Phone calls.</ref> For example, he explains that the older animatronics are in the new restaurant, and have been retrofitted with the new technology, but as the company opted to redesign the characters, they are kept for spare parts.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 2.</ref>\n\nAs the game progresses, it is hinted that something is going on during the day, as the man on the phone mentions that rumors are going around and, later, that a police investigation is going on regarding the restaurant. [[Atari 2600|Atari]]-styled [[minigame]]s reveal that the restaurant has had a troubled past, as it was the location of a [[mass murder]] in which at least five children were murdered, with the culprit frequently appearing as a nameless purple figure (though later installments would give him the name William Afton).<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 4.</ref> On the game's fifth night, Jeremy is informed by the employee that the restaurant has been put on lockdown due to an unspecified event, but which is in place to make sure no employees, present or former, can enter or leave. The man also mentions that the position of the restaurant's day shift security has a vacancy and Jeremy may be promoted to it, and that the owner of Fredbear's Family Diner (a restaurant preceding Freddy Fazbear's Pizza) will be contacted for more information on the incident. Notably, the check the player receives at the end of Night 5 is dated 1987, thereby establishing the game as a [[prequel]] to the original.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Scene: Night 5.</ref>\n\nOn the sixth night, the man on the phone informs Jeremy that the restaurant has been shut down for undisclosed reasons, although he mentions the use of a \"spare yellow suit\" and an issue of the animatronics not functioning properly.<ref>Scott Cawthon. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.'' Night 6.</ref> He also says that he will be taking over as night shift security guard when the restaurant reopens. If Jeremy is successful in surviving the sixth night, he is promoted to day shift to cover a birthday party the next day to make sure the animatronics do not cause any problems. A newspaper that is shown in the winning screen of the sixth night says that the restaurant will close down and the new animatronics will be scrapped; however, the older ones will be saved for when the restaurant reopens, hinting at the events of the first game.\n\nOn the seventh night (Custom Night), the player acts as a new character named Fritz Smith due to Jeremy's promotion. Upon completing Custom Night, Fritz is fired for tampering with the animatronics and odor, a callback to the first game's Custom Night completion screen.\n\n== Development ==\nShortly after the release of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'', developer Cawthon began to confirm rumors of a sequel to the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://games.mxdwn.com/news/sequel-to-five-nights-at-freddys-on-the-way/|title=Sequel to \u2018Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u2019 On The Way  {{!}}   mxdwn Games|website=games.mxdwn.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2017}}</ref> Just one month after the original game's release, Cawthon posted a teaser of a sequel on his webpage, and continued to post teasers until the game's release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-game-five-nights-at-freddys-teases-sequel/1100-6422310/|title=Horror Game Five Nights at Freddy's Teases Sequel|work=GameSpot|access-date=April 25, 2017|language=en}}</ref> A trailer for the game was released in October 2014.
