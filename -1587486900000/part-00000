({{IPA-it|al\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0de de \u02c8\u0261asperi|lang}}; 3 April 1881 \u2013 19 August 1954) was an Italian statesman who founded the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party and served as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] in eight successive coalition governments from 1945 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/153503/Alcide-De-Gasperi Alcide De Gasperi (Italian statesman)]. britannica.com</ref>\n\nDe Gasperi was the last Prime Minister of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], serving under both [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and [[Umberto II]]. He was also the first Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, and also briefly served as provisional head of state after the Italian people voted to end the monarchy and establish a republic. His eight-year term in office remains a landmark of political longevity for a leader in modern Italian politics. De Gasperi is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy by time in office|fifth longest-serving]] Prime Minister since the [[Italian Unification]].\n\nA devout Catholic, he was one of the [[founding fathers of the European Union]] along with fellow Italian [[Altiero Spinelli]].\n\n==Early years==\nDe Gasperi was born in [[Pieve Tesino]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], which at that time belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]], now part of the [[Regions of Italy|region]] of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]] in Italy. His father was a local police officer of limited financial means. From 1896 De Gasperi was active in the Social Christian movement. In 1900 he joined the Faculty of [[Literature]] and [[Philosophy]] in [[Vienna]], where he played an important role in the inception of the Christian student movement. He was very much inspired by the ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1891. In 1904 he took an active part in student demonstrations in favour of an Italian language university. Imprisoned with other protesters during the inauguration of the Italian faculty of law in [[Innsbruck]], he was released after twenty days. In 1905, De Gasperi obtained a degree in [[philology]].\n\nIn 1905, he began to work as editor of the newspaper ''La Voce Cattolica'' (The Catholic Voice) which was replaced in September 1906 by ''Il Trentino'' and after a short time, he became its editor. In his newspaper, he often took positions in favor of a cultural [[autonomy]] for [[Trentino]] and in defense of Italian culture in Trentino in contrast to the [[Germanisation]] plans of the German radical nationalists in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. However, he never questioned whether Trentino should belong to Austria\u2013Hungary and claimed that in the case of a referendum 90% of the people of Trentino would nevertheless choose the popular Austrian emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] over Italy.\n\nIn 1911, he became a Member of Parliament for the [[Popular Political Union of Trentino]] (UPPT) in the [[Austria]]n [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]], a post he held for 6 years. He was politically neutral during [[World War I]], which he spent in [[Vienna]]. However, he sympathized with the ultimately unsuccessful efforts of [[Pope Benedict XV]] (1914\u20131922) and [[beatification|Bl.]] [[Karl I of Austria]] to obtain an honorable peace and stop the war and mass killing. When his home region was transferred to Italy in the post-war settlement, he accepted Italian citizenship. He however never tried to hide his love for [[Austria]] and [[German culture]] and often preferred speaking [[German language|German]] to his family, many of whom spoke German as their first language.\n\n===Opposition to Fascism===\nIn 1919, he was among of the founders of the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), with [[Luigi Sturzo]]. He served as a deputy in the Italian Parliament from 1921 to 1924, a period marked by the rise of [[Italian fascism|Fascism]]. He initially supported the participation of the PPI in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s first government in October 1922.\n\nAs Mussolini's hold on the Italian government grew stronger, he soon diverged with the Fascists over constitutional changes to the powers of the executive and to the election system (the [[Acerbo Law]]), and to Fascist violence against the constitutional parties, culminating in the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]]. The PPI split, and De Gasperi became secretary of the remaining anti-Fascist group in May 1924. In November 1926, in a climate of overt violence and intimidation by the Fascists, the PPI was dissolved.\n\nDe Gasperi was arrested in March 1927 and sentenced to four years in prison. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] negotiated his release. A year and a half in prison nearly broke De Gasperi's health. After his release in July 1928, he was unemployed and in serious financial hardship, until in 1929 his ecclesiastical contacts secured him a job as a cataloguer in the [[Vatican Library]], where he spent the next fourteen years until the collapse of Fascism in July 1943.\n\nDuring the 1930s, De Gasperi wrote a regular international column for the review ''L'Illustrazione Vaticana'' in which he depicted the chief political battle as one between Communism and Christianity. In 1934, he rejoiced in the defeat of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austrian Social Democrats]], whom he condemned for \"de-Christianizing\" the country, and in 1937 he declared that the German Church was correct in preferring Nazism to Bolshevism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ginsborg |first1=Paul |title=A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1988 |date=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=49}}</ref>\n\n===Founding Christian Democracy===\nDuring [[World War II]], he organised the establishment of the first (and at the time, illegal) [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, drawing upon the ideology of the PPI. In January 1943, he published \"Ideas for Reconstruction\" ({{lang-it|Idee ricostruttive}}), which amounted to a programme for the party. He became the first general secretary of the new party in 1944.\n\nDe Gasperi was the undisputed head of the Christian Democrats, the party that dominated Parliament for decades. Although his control of the DC appeared almost complete, he had to carefully balance different factions and interests, especially with regards to relations with the Vatican, social reform, and foreign policy.\n\nWhen [[Southern Italy]] was liberated by the [[Allies (WWII)|Allies]], he became one of the main representatives of DC in the [[National Liberation Committee]]. During the government led by [[Ivanoe Bonomi]], De Gasperi was appointed Minister without portfolio and, in [[Ferruccio Parri]]'s cabinet, he became [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].\n\n==Prime Minister of Italy==\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi anni 50.jpg|thumb|left|De Gasperi as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] during the 1950s]]\nFrom 1945 to 1953, he was the prime minister of eight successive DC-led governments. His eight-year rule remains a landmark of political longevity for one leader in modern Italian politics. During his successive governments, Italy [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|became a Republic]] (1946), signed a [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Peace Treaty with the Allies]] (1947), joined the [[NATO]] in 1949 and became an ally of the United States, which helped to revive the Italian economy through the [[Marshall Plan]]. During that time, Italy became a member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), which later evolved into the [[European Union]] (EU).\n\nIn December 1945, he became [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] for the first time, succeeding [[Ferruccio Parri]] and leading a coalition government that included both [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) and [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), along with other minor parties like [[Italian Republican Party]] (PRI), [[Italian Liberal Party]] (PLI) and [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] (PdA). Communist leader [[Palmiro Togliatti]] acted as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Italy|Deputy Prime Minister]]. He tried to soften the terms of the pending Allied peace treaty with Italy and secured financial and economic aid through the [[European Recovery Program]] (Marshal Plan) \u2013 which was opposed by the Communists.\n\nIn June 1946, Italy held the [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|Constitutional Referendum]] to decide whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic; the republicans won with 54% of the vote. De Gasperi was appointed Provisional Head of State from 18 to 28 June, when the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] elected the Liberal [[Enrico De Nicola]] as provisional Head of State.\n\nAs chief of the Italian delegation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1946|World War II peace conference]] in Paris, De Gasperi harshly criticised the sanctions imposed on Italy, but obtained concessions from the Allies that guaranteed Italian sovereignty. Under the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947]], the eastern border area was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the free territory of [[Trieste]] was divided between the two states.\n\n[[File:De Gasperi Costituente.jpg|thumb|right|De Gasperi during the first session of the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]]]]\nOne his most striking achievements in foreign policy was the [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]] with Austria in September 1946, that established his home region, [[South Tyrol]], as an [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous region]].\n\n===American support===\nDe Gasperi enjoyed considerable support in the US, where he was considered able to oppose the rising tide of Communism \u2013 in particular the PCI, which was the biggest communist party in a Western European democracy. In January 1947 he visited the US. The chief goals of the trip were to soften the terms of the pending peace treaty with Italy and to obtain immediate economic assistance. His ten-day tour, engineered by media mogul [[Henry Luce]] \u2013 the owner of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine \u2013 and his wife, [[Clare Boothe Luce]] - the future ambassador to Rome - was viewed as a media \"triumph,\" prompting positive comments of a wide section of the American press.<ref name=white>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081218062721/http://www.arts.mun.ca/congrips/newsletter/61%20-%20Fall%202005.pdf De Gasperi through American Eyes: Media and Public Opinion, 1945\u201353], by Steven F. White, in Italian Politics and Society, No.61 Fall/Winter 2005</ref>\n\nDuring his meetings in the United States, De Gasperi managed to secure a financially modest but politically significant US$100 million [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Eximbank]] loan to Italy. According to De Gasperi, public opinion would view the loan as a vote of confidence in the Italian Government and strengthen his position versus the PCI in the context of the emerging Cold War. The positive results strengthened De Gasperi\u2019s reputation in Italy. He also came back with useful information on the incipient change in American foreign policy that would lead to the Cold War and in Italy, the break with the PCI and left-wing PSI and their removal from the government in the [[May 1947 crisis]].<ref>[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context=ies The Italian Stabilization of 1947: Domestic and International Factors], by Juan Carlos Martinez Oliva, Institute of European Studies, 2007</ref>\n\nIn May 1947, [[United States President]] [[Harry Truman]] ordered to De Gasperi of creating a new government without the support of Communists and Socialists; he refused and a new cabinet was formed with the (centrist) [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]] (PSDI) of [[Giuseppe Saragat]], the PLI of [[Luigi Einaudi]] and the PRI of [[Randolfo Pacciardi]]; the three leaders of the minor parties were appointed Deputy Prime Ministers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===General election in 1948===\n{{main|1948 Italian general election|CIA activities in Italy}}\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi comizio.jpg|thumb|220px|De Gasperi during a rally of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]]]\nThe [[1948 Italian general election|general elections in April 1948]] were heavily influenced by the cold-war confrontation between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States. After the Soviet-inspired [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|February 1948 communist coup]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the left-wing coalition were to win the elections, the Soviet-funded PCI would draw Italy into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence.\n\nIn the United States, a campaign was launched to prevent a victory of the Communist-dominated [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]] (FDP). [[Italian Americans]] were encouraged to write letters to their relatives in Italy. The popular Italian-American singer [[Frank Sinatra]] made a [[Voice of America]] radio broadcast. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) funneled \"black bag\" contributions to anti-communist candidates with the approval of the [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] and President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]. [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and Clare Booth Luce helped to raise US$2&nbsp;million for the Christian Democracy party.<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24cld.html  The Cold War Begins], Frank Eugene Smitha</ref> ''Time'' magazine backed the campaign and featured De Gasperi on its 19 April 1948 issue\u2019s cover and in its lead story.<ref name=tim190448>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html How to Hang On]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Time'' magazine, 19 April 1948</ref> (He would appear on a Time cover again on 25 May 1953, during the campaign for that year's election, with an extensive biography.<ref name=time250553>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/printout/0,8816,890557,00.html Man from the Mountains]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Time'' magazine, 25 May 1953</ref>)\n\nThe election campaign remains unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy's history on both sides. The election was between two competing visions of the future of Italian society. On the one hand, a Roman Catholic, conservative and capitalist Italy, represented by the governing Christian Democrats of De Gasperi; on the other, a secular, revolutionary and socialist society, represented by the Popular Democratic Front. The Christian Democrat [[Political campaign|campaign]] claimed that, in [[communist]] countries, \"children send parents to jail\", \"children are owned by the state\", \"people eat their own children\", and assured voters that disaster would strike Italy if the [[Left-wing|Left]] were to take power.<ref name=\"time120448\">[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779791,00.html \"Show of Force\"]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, TIME Magazine, 12 April 1948</ref><ref name=\"time190448\">[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html \"How to Hang On\"]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, TIME Magazine, 19 April 1948</ref> Another slogan was, \"In the secrecy of the polling booth, God sees you - Stalin doesn't.\"<ref name=\"bbc130605\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4087420.stm \"Fertility vote galvanises Vatican\"], BBC News, 13 June 2005</ref>\n\nThe PCI were ''de facto'' leading the Popular Democratic Front, and had effectively marginalized the PSI, which eventually suffered because of this in these elections, in terms of parliamentary seats and political power;<ref>The Communist party gained more than the two-thirds of the seats won by the joint list. ([http://legislature.camera.it/frameset.asp?content=%2Faltre%5Fsezionism%2F8793%2F8992%2Fdocumentotesto%2Easp%3F \"Number of MPs for each political group during the First Legislature\"],  Italian Chamber of Deputies website.</ref> The Socialists also had been hurt by the secession of a social-democratic faction led by [[Giuseppe Saragat]], which contested the election with the concurrent list of [[Socialist Unity (Italy)|Socialist Unity]].\n\nThe PCI had difficulties in restraining its more militant members, who, in the period immediately after the war, had engaged in violent acts of reprisals. The areas affected by the violence (the so-called \"Red Triangle\" of [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], or parts of [[Liguria]] around Genoa and Savona, for instance) had previously seen episodes of brutality committed by the [[Fascist]]s  during [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime and the [[Italian Resistance]] during the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' gradual advance through Italy.\n\nThe Christian Democrats won a resounding victory with 48.5% of the vote (their best result ever) and strong majorities in both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The Communists received only half of the votes they had in 1946. With absolute majorities in both chambers, De Gasperi could have formed an exclusively Christian Democratic government. Instead, he formed a \"[[Centrism (Italy)|centrist]]\" coalition with the Liberals, Republicans and Social Democrats. De Gasperi formed three [[Council of Ministers of Italy|ministries]], the second in 1950 after the defection of the Liberals, who hoped for more rightist policies, and the third in 1951 after the defection of the Social Democrats, who hoped for more left-wing policies. He ruled for five more years, helming four additional coalitions. \"De Gasperi\u2019s policy is patience,\" according to the foreign news correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Anne O'Hare McCormick|Anne McCormick]]. \"He seems to be feeling his way among the explosive problems he has to deal with, but perhaps this wary mine-detecting method is the stabilising force that holds the country in balance.\"<ref>New York Times, 16 February 1949, quoted in [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081218062721/http://www.arts.mun.ca/congrips/newsletter/61%20-%20Fall%202005.pdf De Gasperi through American Eyes: Media and Public Opinion, 1945\u201353], by Steven F.

On 31 October 1947 the [[Italian Parliament]] approved a bill that reorganised the health insurance system for service employees (e.g. banking and commerce), with a daily sickness indemnity equal to 50% of earnings for a maximum of 180 days a year, a flat-rate maternity payment, funeral allowance, and free hospital, medical, and pharmaceutical assistance through INAM.<ref name=flora/>\n\nOn 28 February 1949, De Gasperi launched a seven-year plan for social housing to increase the stock of economic housing by means of construction or purchase of economic accommodation. The law also established a special housing fund (INA-Casa) within the National Institute for Insurance ([[Generali Italia|Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni]], or INA).<ref name=flora/> Moreover, on 29 July 1947 the government established a Fund For Social Solidarity within INPS in order to pay graduated supplementary allowances to all pensions, compensating for inflation.<ref name=flora/>\n\n[[File:De Gasperi a Bologna.jpg|thumb|left|220px|De Gasperi addressed the crowd in [[Bologna]], 1951]]\nA law of 29 April 1949 introduced new provisions for unemployment insurance and labor policy. A Central Commission for Work Training and Assistance for the Unemployed was set up with the task of monitoring the state of the labor market and the conditions of the unemployed, while regulations concerning the replacement of the unemployed into the labor market (collocamento) were introduced. Provincial offices for Labour and Full Employment were also established, with local sections, which organized waiting lists, training courses, and the allocation of available jobs, amongst other services. Unemployment indemnity was increased to Lit. 200 per day (approximately 17% of the average gross industrial wage for 1949) and its duration was extended from 120 t 180 days. Unemployment insurance was extended to agricultural workers, and a special unemployment benefit (sussidio straordinario di disoccupazione) was introduced, paid under exceptional circumstances; flat-rate benefit with ad hoc determined level for 90 to 180 days. Vocational training and professional qualification programmes for the unemployed were also introduced, along with a Fund for Professional Training of Workers.<ref name=flora/>\n\nOn 29 April 1949, it was approved a law that introduced new provisions for unemployment insurance and labor policy.

However, it was also the start of his decline. He came under increasing criticism from the emerging left wing in the party. Their main accusations were that he was too cautious in social and economic reform, that he stifled debate and that he subordinated the party to the interests of government.\n\n===1953 general election and decline===\n{{main|1953 Italian general election}}\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi 3.jpg|thumb|180px|De Gasperi during his last years in power]]\nThe [[1953 Italian general election|1953 general election]] was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a [[Majority bonus system|superbonus]] of two thirds of seats in the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|House]] for the coalition which would obtain [[at-large]] the [[majority|absolute majority]] of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC's smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the ''Scam Law'' by its detractors,<ref>Also its parliamentarian exam had a disruptive effect: \"Among the iron pots of political forces that faced in the Cold War, Senate cracked as earthenware pot\": {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Come il Senato si scopr\u00ec vaso di coccio|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo |date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210209}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial [[landslide]] to Christian Democracy.\n\nThe [[Holy See]] actively supported Christian Democracy, declaring that it would be a [[mortal sin]] for a Catholic to vote for the PCI and excommunicating all its supporters. In practice, however, many Communists remained religious: Emilia was known to be an area where people were both religious and communists. [[Giovannino Guareschi]] wrote his novels about [[Don Camillo]] describing a village, [[Brescello]], whose inhabitants are at the same time loyal to priest Camillo and Communist mayor Peppone, who are fierce rivals.\n\nThe campaign of the opposition to the \"Scam Law\" achieved its goal. The government coalition (DC, PSDI, PLI, PRI, [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and [[Sardinian Action Party]]) won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Minor dissident parties determined the final result, especially the short-lived [[National Democratic Alliance (Italy)|National Democratic Alliance]]. The leading party Christian Democracy did not repeat the extraordinary result of five years earlier, which had been obtained under special conditions linked to the [[Cold War]], and lost a lot of votes to the [[right wing|right]], including resurgent [[fascist]] politicians particularly in [[Southern Italy]].\n\n[[File:Churchill De Gasperi.jpg|thumb|left|220px|De Gasperi with UK Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]]]\nTechnically, the government won the election, winning a clear working [[majority]] of seats in both houses. But frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign by the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] on 2 August: De Gasperi consequently retired and died twelve months later.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210209 {{lang|it|Come il Senato si scopr\u00ec vaso di coccio}}, in L\u2019Ago e il filo, 2014].</ref> The legislature continued with weak governments, with minor parties refusing institutional responsibilities. [[Giuseppe Pella]] rose to power, but fell after only five months, following heated disputes about the status of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] which Pella was claiming. [[Amintore Fanfani]]'s succeeding first ministry failed to receive a [[vote of confidence]] in Parliament, whilst [[Mario Scelba]] and [[Antonio Segni]] followed with more traditional centrist coalitions supported by Social Democrats and Liberals: under the administration of Scelba, the problem of [[Trieste]] was settled by ceding [[Koper|Koper/Capodistria]] to [[Yugoslavia]]. The parliamentary term was seen out by the minority government chaired by [[Adone Zoli]], finishing a legislature which hugely weakened the office of the Prime Minister, held by six different leaders.\n\nIn 1954, De Gasperi also had to give up the leadership of the party,<ref name=time270653>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,936090,00.html Cabinet Maker], Time, 27 July 1953</ref> when [[Amintore Fanfani]] was appointed new Secretary of the Christian Democracy in June.<ref name=time100853>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818642,00.html De Gasperi's Fall], Time, 10 August 1953</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi colori.jpg|thumb|right|180px|De Gasperi in his library during his last years]]\nOn 19 August 1954, De Gasperi died in [[Sella di Valsugana]], in his beloved Trentino. It is said that he had to be given a State funeral as he had died with almost no means of his own - a jaw-dropping fact in a country where, even then, politicians were expected to do well for themselves. He is buried in the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], a basilica in Rome. The process for his [[beatification]] was opened in 1993.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92035 Servo di Dio Alcide De Gasperi], Santi beati</ref>\n\n\"De Gasperi was against exacerbating conflict,\" according to his former secretary and former Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]]. \"He taught us to search for compromise, to mediate.\"<ref name=ind240995>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14008143 All the prime minister's men], by [[Alexander Stille]], The Independent, 24 September 1995</ref>\n\nHe is considered to be one of the [[founding fathers of the European Union]].

Democracy]] party and served as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] in eight successive coalition governments from 1945 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/153503/Alcide-De-Gasperi Alcide De Gasperi (Italian statesman)]. britannica.com</ref>\n\nDe Gasperi was the last Prime Minister of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], serving under both [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and [[Umberto II]]. He was also the first Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, and also briefly served as provisional head of state after the Italian people voted to end the monarchy and establish a republic. His eight-year term in office remains a landmark of political longevity for a leader in modern Italian politics. De Gasperi is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy by time in office|fifth longest-serving]] Prime Minister since the [[Italian Unification]].\n\nA devout Catholic, he was one of the [[founding fathers of the European Union]] along with fellow Italian [[Altiero Spinelli]].\n\n==Early years==\nDe Gasperi was born in [[Pieve Tesino]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], which at that time belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]], now part of the [[Regions of Italy|region]] of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]] in Italy. His father was a local police officer of limited financial means. From 1896 De Gasperi was active in the Social Christian movement. In 1900 he joined the Faculty of [[Literature]] and [[Philosophy]] in [[Vienna]], where he played an important role in the inception of the Christian student movement. He was very much inspired by the ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1891. In 1904 he took an active part in student demonstrations in favour of an Italian language university. Imprisoned with other protesters during the inauguration of the Italian faculty of law in [[Innsbruck]], he was released after twenty days. In 1905, De Gasperi obtained a degree in [[philology]].\n\nIn 1905, he began to work as editor of the newspaper ''La Voce Cattolica'' (The Catholic Voice) which was replaced in September 1906 by ''Il Trentino'' and after a short time, he became its editor. In his newspaper, he often took positions in favor of a cultural [[autonomy]] for [[Trentino]] and in defense of Italian culture in Trentino in contrast to the [[Germanisation]] plans of the German radical nationalists in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. However, he never questioned whether Trentino should belong to Austria\u2013Hungary and claimed that in the case of a referendum 90% of the people of Trentino would nevertheless choose the popular Austrian emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] over Italy.\n\nIn 1911, he became a Member of Parliament for the [[Popular Political Union of Trentino]] (UPPT) in the [[Austria]]n [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]], a post he held for 6 years. He was politically neutral during [[World War I]], which he spent in [[Vienna]]. However, he sympathized with the ultimately unsuccessful efforts of [[Pope Benedict XV]] (1914\u20131922) and [[beatification|Bl.]] [[Karl I of Austria]] to obtain an honorable peace and stop the war and mass killing. When his home region was transferred to Italy in the post-war settlement, he accepted Italian citizenship. He however never tried to hide his love for [[Austria]] and [[German culture]] and often preferred speaking [[German language|German]] to his family, many of whom spoke German as their first language.\n\n===Opposition to Fascism===\nIn 1919, he was among of the founders of the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI), with [[Luigi Sturzo]]. He served as a deputy in the Italian Parliament from 1921 to 1924, a period marked by the rise of [[Italian fascism|Fascism]]. He initially supported the participation of the PPI in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s first government in October 1922.\n\nAs Mussolini's hold on the Italian government grew stronger, he soon diverged with the Fascists over constitutional changes to the powers of the executive and to the election system (the [[Acerbo Law]]), and to Fascist violence against the constitutional parties, culminating in the murder of [[Giacomo Matteotti]]. The PPI split, and De Gasperi became secretary of the remaining anti-Fascist group in May 1924. In November 1926, in a climate of overt violence and intimidation by the Fascists, the PPI was dissolved.\n\nDe Gasperi was arrested in March 1927 and sentenced to four years in prison. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] negotiated his release. A year and a half in prison nearly broke De Gasperi's health. After his release in July 1928, he was unemployed and in serious financial hardship, until in 1929 his ecclesiastical contacts secured him a job as a cataloguer in the [[Vatican Library]], where he spent the next fourteen years until the collapse of Fascism in July 1943.\n\nDuring the 1930s, De Gasperi wrote a regular international column for the review ''L'Illustrazione Vaticana'' in which he depicted the chief political battle as one between Communism and Christianity. In 1934, he rejoiced in the defeat of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austrian Social Democrats]], whom he condemned for \"de-Christianizing\" the country, and in 1937 he declared that the German Church was correct in preferring Nazism to Bolshevism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ginsborg |first1=Paul |title=A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1988 |date=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=49}}</ref>\n\n===Founding Christian Democracy===\nDuring [[World War II]], he organised the establishment of the first (and at the time, illegal) [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, drawing upon the ideology of the PPI. In January 1943, he published \"Ideas for Reconstruction\" ({{lang-it|Idee ricostruttive}}), which amounted to a programme for the party. He became the first general secretary of the new party in 1944.\n\nDe Gasperi was the undisputed head of the Christian Democrats, the party that dominated Parliament for decades. Although his control of the DC appeared almost complete, he had to carefully balance different factions and interests, especially with regards to relations with the Vatican, social reform, and foreign policy.\n\nWhen [[Southern Italy]] was liberated by the [[Allies (WWII)|Allies]], he became one of the main representatives of DC in the [[National Liberation Committee]]. During the government led by [[Ivanoe Bonomi]], De Gasperi was appointed Minister without portfolio and, in [[Ferruccio Parri]]'s cabinet, he became [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].\n\n==Prime Minister of Italy==\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi anni 50.jpg|thumb|left|De Gasperi as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] during the 1950s]]\nFrom 1945 to 1953, he was the prime minister of eight successive DC-led governments. His eight-year rule remains a landmark of political longevity for one leader in modern Italian politics. During his successive governments, Italy [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|became a Republic]] (1946), signed a [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Peace Treaty with the Allies]] (1947), joined the [[NATO]] in 1949 and became an ally of the United States, which helped to revive the Italian economy through the [[Marshall Plan]]. During that time, Italy became a member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), which later evolved into the [[European Union]] (EU).\n\nIn December 1945, he became [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] for the first time, succeeding [[Ferruccio Parri]] and leading a coalition government that included both [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) and [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), along with other minor parties like [[Italian Republican Party]] (PRI), [[Italian Liberal Party]] (PLI) and [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] (PdA). Communist leader [[Palmiro Togliatti]] acted as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Italy|Deputy Prime Minister]]. He tried to soften the terms of the pending Allied peace treaty with Italy and secured financial and economic aid through the [[European Recovery Program]] (Marshal Plan) \u2013 which was opposed by the Communists.\n\nIn June 1946, Italy held the [[1946 Italian constitutional referendum|Constitutional Referendum]] to decide whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic; the republicans won with 54% of the vote. De Gasperi was appointed Provisional Head of State from 18 to 28 June, when the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] elected the Liberal [[Enrico De Nicola]] as provisional Head of State.\n\nAs chief of the Italian delegation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1946|World War II peace conference]] in Paris, De Gasperi harshly criticised the sanctions imposed on Italy, but obtained concessions from the Allies that guaranteed Italian sovereignty. Under the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947]], the eastern border area was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the free territory of [[Trieste]] was divided between the two states.\n\n[[File:De Gasperi Costituente.jpg|thumb|right|De Gasperi during the first session of the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]]]]\nOne his most striking achievements in foreign policy was the [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]] with Austria in September 1946, that established his home region, [[South Tyrol]], as an [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous region]].\n\n===American support===\nDe Gasperi enjoyed considerable support in the US, where he was considered able to oppose the rising tide of Communism \u2013 in particular the PCI, which was the biggest communist party in a Western European democracy. In January 1947 he visited the US. The chief goals of the trip were to soften the terms of the pending peace treaty with Italy and to obtain immediate economic assistance. His ten-day tour, engineered by media mogul [[Henry Luce]] \u2013 the owner of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine \u2013 and his wife, [[Clare Boothe Luce]] - the future ambassador to Rome - was viewed as a media \"triumph,\" prompting positive comments of a wide section of the American press.<ref name=white>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081218062721/http://www.arts.mun.ca/congrips/newsletter/61%20-%20Fall%202005.pdf De Gasperi through American Eyes: Media and Public Opinion, 1945\u201353], by Steven F. White, in Italian Politics and Society, No.61 Fall/Winter 2005</ref>\n\nDuring his meetings in the United States, De Gasperi managed to secure a financially modest but politically significant US$100&nbsp; million [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Eximbank]] loan to Italy. According to De Gasperi, public opinion would view the loan as a vote of confidence in the Italian Government and strengthen his position versus the PCI in the context of the emerging Cold War. The positive results strengthened De Gasperi\u2019s reputation in Italy. He also came back with useful information on the incipient change in American foreign policy that would lead to the Cold War and in Italy, the break with the PCI and left-wing PSI and their removal from the government in the [[May 1947 crisis]].<ref>[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context=ies The Italian Stabilization of 1947: Domestic and International Factors], by Juan Carlos Martinez Oliva, Institute of European Studies, 2007</ref>\n\nIn May 1947, [[United States President]] [[Harry Truman]] ordered to De Gasperi of creating a new government without the support of Communists and Socialists; he refused and a new cabinet was formed with the (centrist) [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]] (PSDI) of [[Giuseppe Saragat]], the PLI of [[Luigi Einaudi]] and the PRI of [[Randolfo Pacciardi]]; the three leaders of the minor parties were appointed Deputy Prime Ministers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===General election in 1948===\n{{main|1948 Italian general election|CIA activities in Italy}}\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi comizio.jpg|thumb|220px|De Gasperi during a rally of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]]]\nThe [[1948 Italian general election|general elections in April 1948]] were heavily influenced by the cold-war confrontation between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States. After the Soviet-inspired [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|February 1948 communist coup]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the left-wing coalition were to win the elections, the Soviet-funded PCI would draw Italy into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence.\n\nIn the United States, a campaign was launched to prevent a victory of the Communist-dominated [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]] (FDP). [[Italian Americans]] were encouraged to write letters to their relatives in Italy. The popular Italian-American singer [[Frank Sinatra]] made a [[Voice of America]] radio broadcast. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) funneled \"black bag\" contributions to anti-communist candidates with the approval of the [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] and President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]. [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and Clare Booth Luce helped to raise US$2&nbsp;million for the Christian Democracy party.<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24cld.html  The Cold War Begins], Frank Eugene Smitha</ref> ''Time'' magazine backed the campaign and featured De Gasperi on its 19 April 1948 issue\u2019s cover and in its lead story.<ref name=tim190448>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html How to Hang On]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Time'' magazine, 19 April 1948</ref> (He would appear on a Time cover again on 25 May 1953, during the campaign for that year's election, with an extensive biography.<ref name=time250553>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/printout/0,8816,890557,00.html Man from the Mountains]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Time'' magazine, 25 May 1953</ref>)\n\nThe election campaign remains unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy's history on both sides. The election was between two competing visions of the future of Italian society. On the one hand, a Roman Catholic, conservative and capitalist Italy, represented by the governing Christian Democrats of De Gasperi; on the other, a secular, revolutionary and socialist society, represented by the Popular Democratic Front. The Christian Democrat [[Political campaign|campaign]] claimed that, in [[communist]] countries, \"children send parents to jail\", \"children are owned by the state\", \"people eat their own children\", and assured voters that disaster would strike Italy if the [[Left-wing|Left]] were to take power.<ref name=\"time120448\">[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779791,00.html \"Show of Force\"]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, TIME Magazine, 12 April 1948</ref><ref name=\"time190448\">[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html \"How to Hang On\"]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, TIME Magazine, 19 April 1948</ref> Another slogan was, \"In the secrecy of the polling booth, God sees you - Stalin doesn't.\"<ref name=\"bbc130605\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4087420.stm \"Fertility vote galvanises Vatican\"], BBC News, 13 June 2005</ref>\n\nThe PCI were ''de facto'' leading the Popular Democratic Front, and had effectively marginalized the PSI, which eventually suffered because of this in these elections, in terms of parliamentary seats and political power;<ref>The Communist party gained more than the two-thirds of the seats won by the joint list. ([http://legislature.camera.it/frameset.asp?content=%2Faltre%5Fsezionism%2F8793%2F8992%2Fdocumentotesto%2Easp%3F \"Number of MPs for each political group during the First Legislature\"],  Italian Chamber of Deputies website.</ref> The Socialists also had been hurt by the secession of a social-democratic faction led by [[Giuseppe Saragat]], which contested the election with the concurrent list of [[Socialist Unity (Italy)|Socialist Unity]].\n\nThe PCI had difficulties in restraining its more militant members, who, in the period immediately after the war, had engaged in violent acts of reprisals. The areas affected by the violence (the so-called \"Red Triangle\" of [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], or parts of [[Liguria]] around Genoa and Savona, for instance) had previously seen episodes of brutality committed by the [[Fascist]]s  during [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime and the [[Italian Resistance]] during the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' gradual advance through Italy.\n\nThe Christian Democrats won a resounding victory with 48.5% of the vote (their best result ever) and strong majorities in both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The Communists received only half of the votes they had in 1946. With absolute majorities in both chambers, De Gasperi could have formed an exclusively Christian Democratic government. Instead, he formed a \"[[Centrism (Italy)|centrist]]\" coalition with the Liberals, Republicans and Social Democrats. De Gasperi formed three [[Council of Ministers of Italy|ministries]], the second in 1950 after the defection of the Liberals, who hoped for more rightist policies, and the third in 1951 after the defection of the Social Democrats, who hoped for more left-wing policies. He ruled for five more years, helming four additional coalitions. \"De Gasperi\u2019s policy is patience,\" according to the foreign news correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Anne O'Hare McCormick|Anne McCormick]]. \"He seems to be feeling his way among the explosive problems he has to deal with, but perhaps this wary mine-detecting method is the stabilising force that holds the country in balance.\"<ref>New York Times, 16 February 1949, quoted in [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081218062721/http://www.arts.mun.ca/congrips/newsletter/61%20-%20Fall%202005.pdf De Gasperi through American Eyes: Media and Public Opinion, 1945\u201353], by Steven F.

On 31 October 1947 the [[Italian Parliament]] approved a bill that reorganised the health insurance system for service employees (e.g. banking and commerce), with a daily sickness indemnity equal to 50% of earnings for a maximum of 180 days a year, a flat-rate maternity payment, funeral allowance, and free hospital, medical, and pharmaceutical assistance through INAM.<ref name=flora/>\n\nOn 28 February 1949, De Gasperi launched a seven-year plan for social housing to increase the stock of economic housing by means of construction or purchase of economic accommodation. The law also established a special housing fund (INA-Casa) within the National Institute for Insurance ([[Generali Italia|Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni]], or INA).<ref name=flora/> Moreover, on 29 July 1947 the government established a Fund For Social Solidarity within INPS in order to pay graduated supplementary allowances to all pensions, compensating for inflation.<ref name=flora/>\n\n[[File:De Gasperi a Bologna.jpg|thumb|left|220px|De Gasperi addressed the crowd in [[Bologna]], 1951]]\nA law of 29 April 1949 introduced new provisions for unemployment insurance and labor policy. A Central Commission for Work Training and Assistance for the Unemployed was set up with the task of monitoring the state of the labor market and the conditions of the unemployed, while regulations concerning the replacement of the unemployed into the labor market (collocamento) were introduced. Provincial offices for Labour and Full Employment were also established, with local sections, which organized waiting lists, training courses, and the allocation of available jobs, amongst other services. Unemployment indemnity was increased to Lit. 200 per day (approximately 17% of the average gross industrial wage for 1949) and its duration was extended from 120 t 180 days. Unemployment insurance was extended to agricultural workers, and a special unemployment benefit (sussidio straordinario di disoccupazione) was introduced, paid under exceptional circumstances; flat-rate benefit with ad hoc determined level for 90 to 180 days. Vocational training and professional qualification programmes for the unemployed were also introduced, along with a Fund for Professional Training of Workers.<ref name=flora/>\n\nOn 29 April 1949, it was approved a law that introduced new provisions for unemployment insurance and labor policy. A Central Commission for Work Training and Assistance for the Unemployed was established with the task of monitoring the state of the labor market and the conditions of the unemployed.<ref name=flora/>\n\nOn 23 March 1948, the National Institute for Assistance of the Orphans of Italian Workers and the National Institute for Italian Pensioners were established, providing benefits and services for needy pensioners.<ref name=flora/> On 26 August 1950, the government introduced various regulations covering maternity insurance for all female employees.<ref name=flora/>\n\nIn 1952, the party overwhelmingly endorsed his authority over the government and over the party. However, it was also the start of his decline. He came under increasing criticism from the emerging left wing in the party. Their main accusations were that he was too cautious in social and economic reform, that he stifled debate and that he subordinated the party to the interests of government.\n\n===1953 general election and decline===\n{{main|1953 Italian general election}}\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi 3.jpg|thumb|180px|De Gasperi during his last years in power]]\nThe [[1953 Italian general election|1953 general election]] was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a [[Majority bonus system|superbonus]] of two thirds of seats in the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|House]] for the coalition which would obtain [[at-large]] the [[majority|absolute majority]] of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC's smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the ''Scam Law'' by its detractors,<ref>Also its parliamentarian exam had a disruptive effect: \"Among the iron pots of political forces that faced in the Cold War, Senate cracked as earthenware pot\": {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Come il Senato si scopr\u00ec vaso di coccio|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo |date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210209}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial [[landslide]] to Christian Democracy.\n\nThe [[Holy See]] actively supported Christian Democracy, declaring that it would be a [[mortal sin]] for a Catholic to vote for the PCI and excommunicating all its supporters. In practice, however, many Communists remained religious: Emilia was known to be an area where people were both religious and communists. [[Giovannino Guareschi]] wrote his novels about [[Don Camillo]] describing a village, [[Brescello]], whose inhabitants are at the same time loyal to priest Camillo and Communist mayor Peppone, who are fierce rivals.\n\nThe campaign of the opposition to the \"Scam Law\" achieved its goal. The government coalition (DC, PSDI, PLI, PRI, [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and [[Sardinian Action Party]]) won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Minor dissident parties determined the final result, especially the short-lived [[National Democratic Alliance (Italy)|National Democratic Alliance]]. The leading party Christian Democracy did not repeat the extraordinary result of five years earlier, which had been obtained under special conditions linked to the [[Cold War]], and lost a lot of votes to the [[right wing|right]], including resurgent [[fascist]] politicians particularly in [[Southern Italy]].\n\n[[File:Churchill De Gasperi.jpg|thumb|left|220px|De Gasperi with UK Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]]]\nTechnically, the government won the election, winning a clear working [[majority]] of seats in both houses. But frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign by the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] on 2 August: De Gasperi consequently retired and died twelve months later.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210209 {{lang|it|Come il Senato si scopr\u00ec vaso di coccio}}, in L\u2019Ago e il filo, 2014].</ref> The legislature continued with weak governments, with minor parties refusing institutional responsibilities. [[Giuseppe Pella]] rose to power, but fell after only five months, following heated disputes about the status of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] which Pella was claiming. [[Amintore Fanfani]]'s succeeding first ministry failed to receive a [[vote of confidence]] in Parliament, whilst [[Mario Scelba]] and [[Antonio Segni]] followed with more traditional centrist coalitions supported by Social Democrats and Liberals: under the administration of Scelba, the problem of [[Trieste]] was settled by ceding [[Koper|Koper/Capodistria]] to [[Yugoslavia]]. The parliamentary term was seen out by the minority government chaired by [[Adone Zoli]], finishing a legislature which hugely weakened the office of the Prime Minister, held by six different leaders.\n\nIn 1954, De Gasperi also had to give up the leadership of the party,<ref name=time270653>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,936090,00.html Cabinet Maker], Time, 27 July 1953</ref> when [[Amintore Fanfani]] was appointed new Secretary of the Christian Democracy in June.<ref name=time100853>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818642,00.html De Gasperi's Fall], Time, 10 August 1953</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Alcide De Gasperi colori.jpg|thumb|right|180px|De Gasperi in his library during his last years]]\nOn 19 August 1954, De Gasperi died in [[Sella di Valsugana]], in his beloved Trentino.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.{{sfn|Siborne|1895| pp= 320\u2013323}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.waterloo-campaign.nl/bestanden/files/preambles/plannen.nap.pdf |title= The campaign of 1815: a study - A fundamental choice: a defensive or offensive war  |publisher= Waterloo Campaign NL | date= | author=  | accessdate= April 8, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nAn additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general.

In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree...

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence.

Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite ''carabinier'' brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=359}}\n\nA British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:\n\n{{quote|About four p.m., the enemy's artillery in front of us ceased firing all of a sudden, and we saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=191\u2013192}} Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded.

At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them.

Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the [[Holy Alliance]] of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]] into a [[German Confederation]] increasingly marked by the political dominance of [[Prussia]].

He also seems to have discounted the presence of B\u00fclow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.}} the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.|Antoine-Henri Jomini.{{sfn|Jomini|1864|pp=223, 224}} }}\n\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\n\n{{quote|\nBonaparte and the authors who support him have always attempted to portray the great catastrophes that befell him as the result of chance.

The operation of General B\u00fclow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded\".<ref name=\"Gazette, 17028\"/>}}\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the ''Campaign of 1815'' and ''Wellington's famous 1842 essay'' in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay]''}} Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|pp=144\u2013145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'')}}\n\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. ....

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]] (KGL). All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were Peninsular War veterans.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=484}} In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|Captain [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer]] [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], thought the Brunswickers \"...perfect children.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst. Waterloo, 19th June 1815''}} Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30.{{efn|\"The hour at which Waterloo began, though there were 150,000&nbsp;actors in the great tragedy, was long a matter of dispute. The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded.

Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.}} the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.|Antoine-Henri Jomini.{{sfn|Jomini|1864|pp=223, 224}} }}\n\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\n\n{{quote|\nBonaparte and the authors who support him have always attempted to portray the great catastrophes that befell him as the result of chance. They seek to make their readers believe that through his great wisdom and extraordinary energy the whole project had already moved forward with the greatest confidence, that complete success was but a hair's breadth away, when treachery, accident, or even fate, as they sometimes call it, ruined everything. He and his supporters do not want to admit that huge mistakes, sheer recklessness, and, above all, overreaching ambition that exceeded all realistic possibilities, were the true causes.|Carl von Clausewitz.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Feldzug von 1815 (''Campaign of 1815'')|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm#Ch3 Chapter 3]''}} }}\n\nWellington himself wrote in his official dispatch back to London:\n\n{{quote|I should not do justice to my own feelings, or to Marshal Bl\u00fccher and the Prussian army, if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General B\u00fclow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded\".<ref name=\"Gazette, 17028\"/>}}\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the ''Campaign of 1815'' and ''Wellington's famous 1842 essay'' in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay]''}} Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|pp=144\u2013145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'')}}\n\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. .... Bl\u00fccher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat\".{{sfn|Parkinson|2000|pp=240\u2013241}} Steele (2014) writes: \"Bl\u00fccher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Bl\u00fccher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank, Wellington was able to shift to the offensive\".{{sfn|Steele|2014|p=178}}\n\n==Battlefield today==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:0 Braine-l'Alleud 051012 (1).JPG|thumb|The [[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo]]\n\nSome portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\".{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|p=345}} In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument. The [[Lion's Mound]], a giant artificial hill, was constructed here using {{convert|300000|m3|cuyd}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.\n\n{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on 18&nbsp;June 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb.

These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The events of the series take place after the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Spellman serving as [[head writer]] and [[Kari Skogland]] directing.\n\n[[Anthony Mackie]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] reprise their roles as Falcon and Winter Soldier, respectively, from the film series. [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Emily VanCamp]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. As of September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, with Spellman hired to write one on Falcon and Winter Soldier in October. The series was officially confirmed in April 2019 along with Mackie and Stan's involvement. Skogland was hired the next month. Filming began in October 2019 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to premiere in August 2020, and will consist of six episodes.

The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" />\n\nMalcolm Spellman was hired to write a limited series that would focus on [[Anthony Mackie]]'s [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] and [[Sebastian Stan]]'s [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]] at the end of October 2018.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier\" /><ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Mackie and Stan had both previously expressed interest in starring in an MCU spin-off film together, with Stan comparing the potential idea to [[Buddy film|buddy comedy films]] like ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988) and ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> Marvel and Disney officially announced the series in April 2019, with the title ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, the miniseries was confirmed to consist of six episodes, and [[Kari Skogland]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series picks up following the ending of the film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), which depicts [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] bequeathing his [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and the mantle of [[Captain America]] to Wilson.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> [[Derek Kolstad]] joined the series' writing team in July 2019,<ref name=\"Kolstad\" /> and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise ''[[John Wick]]''.<ref name=\"KolstadJohnWick\" /> Kolstad added that the series would explore reactions to a black man becoming Captain America.<ref name=\"KolstadBlackCap\" /> Spellman wanted to \"go home\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action in the series.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Sebastian Stan & Anthony Mackie (48469219356).jpg|thumb|Stan and Mackie at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] promoting the series]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] and [[Emily VanCamp]] entered negotiations to reprise their film roles of [[Helmut Zemo]] and [[Sharon Carter]], respectively.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Br\u00fchl was confirmed for the series in July 2019,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when [[Wyatt Russell]] was announced to be cast in the series as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> Set photos in November 2019 revealed [[Adepero Oduye]] would appear in the series,<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> while [[Desmond Chiam]] and [[Miki Ishikawa]] joined the cast a month later.<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]] was cast in January 2020,<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and the following month, [[Carl Lumbly]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 31, 2019,<ref name=\"SpellmanFilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref name=\"F&WSFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MackieMensHealth\" /> with Skogland directing.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> The series is filmed under the working title ''Tag Team''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4.<ref name=\"FilmingStartOfficial\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] from November through February 2020.<ref name=\"AtlantaNov2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaDec2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaJan2020\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFeb2020\" />\n\nIn mid-January 2020, filming was expected to take place in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] for two weeks. However, because of [[2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes|earthquakes on the island]], production was suspended. Reporting on this news, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' stated that it was unclear if the location would still be used for filming.<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> On March 3, the production was revealed to be moving to [[Prague, Czech Republic]] for three weeks until March 25,<ref name=\"Prague\" /> with filming in the city starting on March 6 and expected to continue until the week of March 16. However, filming stopped on March 10 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] and members of the production returned to Atlanta. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that it seemed unlikely that the production would return to Prague at that point.<ref name=\"PragueHalted\" /> Later in March, Stan revealed that filming had not been completed, but planned to be once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"StanFilmingUpdate\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nConcept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in ''Expanding the Universe'', a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> In December, Feige debuted the first images from the series at [[Comic Con Experience]]. Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] described these as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series ''[[WandaVision]]'', which was also promoted at the event, with a \"standard spy thriller\" look similar to the ''Captain America'' films that the title characters were introduced in.<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> A commercial for the series, ''WandaVision'', and ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref name=\"VergeSuperBowlSpot\" /> Haleigh Foutch at ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \"stole the whole show\" and had \"a lot to get excited about\".<ref name=\"ColliderSuperBowlSpot\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to debut in August 2020 on [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" /> and will consist of six episodes to be released weekly rather than all at once.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"EpisodeRelease\" /> It will be the first series released in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase

The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" />\n\nMalcolm Spellman was hired to write a limited series that would focus on [[Anthony Mackie]]'s [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] and [[Sebastian Stan]]'s [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]] at the end of October 2018.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier\" /><ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Mackie and Stan had both previously expressed interest in starring in an MCU spin-off film together, with Stan comparing the potential idea to [[Buddy film|buddy comedy films]] like ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988) and ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> Marvel and Disney officially announced the series in April 2019, with the title ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, the miniseries was confirmed to consist of six episodes, and [[Kari Skogland]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series picks up following the ending of the film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), which depicts [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] bequeathing his [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and the mantle of [[Captain America]] to Wilson.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> [[Derek Kolstad]] joined the series' writing team in July 2019,<ref name=\"Kolstad\" /> and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise ''[[John Wick]]''.<ref name=\"KolstadJohnWick\" /> Kolstad added that the series would explore reactions to a black man becoming Captain America.<ref name=\"KolstadBlackCap\" /> Spellman wanted to \"go home\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action in the series.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Sebastian Stan & Anthony Mackie (48469219356).jpg|thumb|Stan and Mackie at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] promoting the series]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] and [[Emily VanCamp]] entered negotiations to reprise their film roles of [[Helmut Zemo]] and [[Sharon Carter]], respectively.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Br\u00fchl was confirmed for the series in July 2019,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when [[Wyatt Russell]] was announced to be cast in the series as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> Set photos in November 2019 revealed [[Adepero Oduye]] would appear in the series,<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> while [[Desmond Chiam]] and [[Miki Ishikawa]] joined the cast a month later.<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]] was cast in January 2020,<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and the following month, [[Carl Lumbly]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 31, 2019,<ref name=\"SpellmanFilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref name=\"F&WSFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MackieMensHealth\" /> with Skogland directing.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> The series is filmed under the working title ''Tag Team''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4.<ref name=\"FilmingStartOfficial\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] from November through February 2020.<ref name=\"AtlantaNov2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaDec2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaJan2020\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFeb2020\" />\n\nIn mid-January 2020, filming was expected to take place in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] for two weeks. However, because of [[2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes|earthquakes on the island]], production was suspended. Reporting on this news, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' stated that it was unclear if the location would still be used for filming.<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> On March 3, the production was revealed to be moving to [[Prague, Czech Republic]] for three weeks until March 25,<ref name=\"Prague\" /> with filming in the city starting on March 6 and expected to continue until the week of March 16. However, filming stopped on March 10 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] and members of the production returned to Atlanta. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that it seemed unlikely that the production would return to Prague at that point.<ref name=\"PragueHalted\" /> Later in March, Stan revealed that filming had not been completed, but planned to be once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"StanFilmingUpdate\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nConcept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in ''Expanding the Universe'', a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> In December, Feige debuted the first images from the series at [[Comic Con Experience]]. Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] described these as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series ''[[WandaVision]]'', which was also promoted at the event, with a \"standard spy thriller\" look similar to the ''Captain America'' films that the title characters were introduced in.<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> A commercial for the series, ''WandaVision'', and ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref name=\"VergeSuperBowlSpot\" /> Haleigh Foutch at ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \"stole the whole show\" and had \"a lot to get excited about\".<ref name=\"ColliderSuperBowlSpot\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to debut in August 2020 on [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" /> and will consist of six episodes to be released weekly rather than all at once.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"EpisodeRelease\" /> It will be the first series released in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseFour\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\">{{Cite web

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission. In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.\n\n==Rise to fame==\n===Early childhood===\n[[File:Charles&Dad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Charles A. Lindbergh and his father, circa 1910]]\n\nLindbergh was born in Detroit, Michigan on {{nowrap|February 4}}, 1902 and spent most of his childhood in Little Falls, Minnesota and Washington, D.C. He was the third child of [[Charles August Lindbergh]] ([[Name at birth|birth name]] Carl M\u00e5nsson; 1859\u20131924) who had emigrated from Sweden to [[Melrose, Minnesota]] as an infant, and his only child with his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh (1876\u20131954), of Detroit.

Wallace considered Lindbergh to be a well-intentioned but bigoted and misguided Nazi sympathizer whose career as the leader of the isolationist movement had a destructive impact on Jewish people.<ref>Wallace 2005, p. 358.</ref>\n\nLindbergh's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning biographer, [[A. Scott Berg]], contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one. Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh's views were commonplace in the United States in the pre\u2013World War II era. Lindbergh's support for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments of a number of American people.<ref>Berg 1998{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n\nBerg also noted: \"As late as April 1939{{mdashb}}after Germany overtook Czechoslovakia{{mdashb}}Lindbergh was willing to make excuses for Hitler. 'Much as I disapprove of many things Hitler had done,' he wrote in his diary on {{nowrap|April 2}}, 1939, 'I believe she [Germany] has pursued the only consistent policy in Europe in recent years. I cannot support her broken promises, but she has only moved a little faster than other nations&nbsp;... in breaking promises. The question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history.'\" Berg also explained that leading up to the war, Lindbergh believed the great battle would be between the Soviet Union and Germany, not fascism and democracy.\n\nWallace noted that it was difficult to find social scientists among Lindbergh's contemporaries in the 1930s who found validity in racial explanations for human behavior. Wallace went on to observe, \"throughout his life, eugenics would remain one of Lindbergh's enduring passions.\"<ref>Wallace 2005, p. 99.</ref>\n\nLindbergh always championed military strength and alertness.<ref>Lindbergh, Charles A.

As a technical adviser with Ford in 1942, he was heavily involved in troubleshooting early problems at the [[Willow Run]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bomber production line.

He demonstrated how Marine pilots could take off safely with a bomb load double the [[Vought F4U Corsair]] fighter-bomber's rated capacity. At the time, several Marine squadrons were flying bomber escorts to destroy the Japanese stronghold of [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]], in the Australian [[Territory of New Guinea]].

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission. In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.\n\n==Rise to fame==\n===Early childhood===\n[[File:Charles&Dad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Charles A.

Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself.

In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" (the Canadian version of the Jenny).

However, since there is a long period of Protestant vs. Catholic (establishment) unrest leading up to this war, it is not easy to give an exact date when the war, or the 'Dutch Revolt', actually started. The first open violence that would lead to the war was the 1566 iconoclasm known as the '''Iconoclastic Fury''' ({{lang|nl|[[Beeldenstorm]]}}), and sometimes the first Spanish repressions of the riots (i.e. [[battle of Oosterweel]], 1567) are considered the starting point. Most accounts cite the 1568 invasions of armies of mercenaries paid by William of Orange as the official start of the war; this article adopts that point of view.

The revolt resulted in the establishment of an de facto independent Protestant republic in the north by [[Treaty of Antwerp (1609)]], although Spain did not officially recognize Dutch independence until 1648. The eight decades of war came at a massive human cost, with an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 victims, of which 350,000 to 400,000 were civilians killed by disease and what would later be considered war crimes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victimario Hist\u00f3rico Militar|url=http://remilitari.com/guias/victimario9.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]] had been important hubs of the European maritime trade network for centuries prior to Spanish rule.

The rivalry with Portugal, however, was not entirely economic: from 1580, after the death of the King of Portugal, [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian I]], and much of the Portuguese nobility in the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]], the Portuguese crown had been joined to that of Spain in an \"[[Iberian Union]]\" under the heir of Emperor Charles V, [[Philip II of Spain]]. By attacking Portuguese overseas possessions, the Dutch forced Spain to divert financial and military resources away from its attempt to quell Dutch independence.<ref>Scammel (1989), p.20.</ref> Thus began the several decade-long [[Dutch-Portuguese War]].\n\nIn 1594, the ''[[Compagnie van Verre]]'' (\"Company of Far Lands\") was founded in Amsterdam, with the aim of sending two fleets to the spice islands of [[Maluku islands|Maluku]].<ref>Boxer (1965), p.22.</ref> The first fleet sailed in 1596 and returned in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage.

The charter awarded to the Company by the States-General granted it sole rights, for an initial period of 21&nbsp;years, to Dutch trade and navigation east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and west of the [[Straits of Magellan]]. The directors of the company, the \"''Heeren XVII''\", were given the legal authority to establish \"fortresses and strongholds\", to sign treaties, to enlist both an army and a navy, and to wage defensive war.<ref>Boxer (1965), p.24.</ref> The company itself was founded as a [[joint stock company]], similarly to its English rival that had been founded two years earlier, the [[English East India Company]].

It was largely fought on the European continent, but war was also conducted against Phillip II's overseas territories, including Spanish colonies and the Portuguese metropoles, colonies, [[Factory (trading post)#Portuguese Feitorias (c. 1445)|trading posts]] and [[Fortification|forts]] belonging at that time to the King of Spain and Portugal.\n\nThe Netherlands became part of the domains of the [[Habsburg Spain|'Spanish branch']] of the Habsburg dynasty when Emperor Charles V divided the holdings of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg Empire]] following his abdication in 1555. In 1566, the [[Dutch revolt]] erupted and in 1568 the [[Dutch Republic]] embarked on the long, torturous path of the Eighty Years' War (also known as the [[Dutch War of Independence]]) and began the invasion and looting of Spanish (and, later, Portuguese) colonies in the Americas and of Asia, including an attempted invasion of the [[Philippines]] (then part of the [[Spanish East Indies]]).\n\n[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazili\u00eb Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Olinda]], Pernambuco, Dutch Brazil]]\nFrom 1517, the port of [[Lisbon]] in [[Portugal]] was the main European market for products from India that was attended by other nations to purchase their needs. But as a result of Portugal's incorporation in the Iberian Union with Spain by Philip II in 1580, all Portuguese territories were thereafter Spanish Habsburg branch territory, and thus all Portuguese markets were closed to the United Provinces. Thus, in 1595, the Dutch decided to set sail on their own to acquire products for themselves, making use of the \"secret\" knowledge of the Portuguese trade routes, which [[Cornelis de Houtman]] had managed to acquire in Lisbon.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Vidal, Prudencio. (1888)</ref>\n\nPursuing their quest for alternative routes to Asia for trade, the Dutch were disrupting the Spanish-Portuguese trade, and they eventually ranged as far afield as the Philippines. The Dutch sought to dominate the commercial sea trade in Southeast Asia, going so far in pursuit of this goal as to engage in what other nations and powers considered to be little more than piratical activities.\n\n[[File:Victor Meirelles - 'Battle of Guararapes', 1879, oil on canvas, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, Rio de Janeiro 2.jpg|thumb|The Portuguese victory at the [[Second Battle of Guararapes|Battle of Guararapes]], ended Dutch presence in Brazil.]]\nThe joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, with King Phillip II's enemies becoming Portugal's enemies as well. War with the Dutch led to attacks on most of Portugal's far-flung [[Portuguese Empire#Southeast Asia and the spice trade|trading network]] in and around [[Asia]], including Ceylon (modern [[Sri Lanka]]), and [[History of Goa#Decline|Goa]], as well as [[Portuguese Empire#Iberian Union and rivalry with the Protestant Powers (1580\u20131663)|attacks upon her commercial interests]] in [[Nanban trade|Japan]], [[Portuguese Empire#Age of Discovery (1415\u20131542)|Africa]] (especially [[Elmina Castle#Control by other European nations|Mina]]), and [[South America]]. Even though the Portuguese had never been able to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they had been able to keep the [[Portuguese Ceylon|coastal regions]] under their control for a considerable time before the coming of the Dutch in war. Portugal's South American colony, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], was partially conquered by both [[France]] and the United Provinces.\n\nIn the 17th century, the \"[[Groot Desseyn|Grand Design]]\" of the [[Dutch West India Company|West India Company]] involved attempting to corner the international trade in sugar by attacking Portuguese colonies in Brazil and Africa, seizing both the sugarcane plantations and the slave ports needed to resupply their labour. Although weakened by the [[Iberian Union]] with Spain, whose attention was focused elsewhere, the Portuguese were able to fight off the initial assault before the [[Battle of Matanzas Bay]] provided the WIC with the funds needed for a successful operation. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Johan Maurits]] was appointed governor of \"[[Dutch Brazil|New Holland]]\" and landed at [[Recife]] in January 1637. In a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from [[Sergipe]] on the south to [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds de Maranh\u00e3o|Maranh\u00e3o]] in the north. The WIC also succeeded in conquering [[Goree]], [[Elmina Castle]], Saint Thomas, and [[Luanda]] on the west coast of Africa. Both regions were also used as bases for Dutch privateers plundering Portuguese and Spanish trade routes. The dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640 and Maurits's recall in 1643 led to increased resistance from the Portuguese colonists who still made up a majority of the Brazilian settlers. The Dutch were finally overcome during the 1650s but managed to receive 4 million [[Portuguese real|reis]] (63 [[metric tons]] of gold) in exchange for extinguishing their claims over Brazil in the [[1661 Treaty of the Hague]].\n\n==== Asia ====\n[[File: Dutch and Portuguese in Asia c 1665.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Primary Dutch and Portuguese settlements in Asia, c. 1665.

The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless, the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so.<ref>Boxer (1969), p.23.</ref> [[Ambon Island|Amboina]] was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on [[Malacca]] the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favourable monsoon winds.<ref>Boxer (1965), p.189.</ref> The Dutch found what they were looking for in [[Jakarta]], conquered by [[Jan Coen]] in 1619, later renamed [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] after the putative Dutch ancestors the Batavians, and which would become the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. [[Malacca]] [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|finally succumbed in 1641]] (after a second attempt to capture it), [[Colombo]] in 1656, [[Ceylon]] in 1658, [[Nagappattinam]] in 1662 and [[Cranganore]] and [[Cochin]] in 1662.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n[[Goa]], the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was unsuccessfully attacked by the Dutch in 1603 and 1610. Whilst the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture [[Macau]]<ref>Shipp, p.22.</ref> from where Portugal monopolized the lucrative [[Nanban trade|China-Japan trade]], the [[shogunate|Japanese shogunate's]] increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent [[sakoku|''sakoku'' policy]], from 1639 till 1854 (215 years) the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to [[Hirado]] and then from 1641 at [[Deshima]].

There are also significant examples of 17\u201319th century Dutch architecture around [[Banda Neira]], [[Nusa Laut]] and [[Saparua]], the former main spices islands, which due to limited economic development have retained many of its colonial elements.

However, since there is a long period of Protestant vs. Catholic (establishment) unrest leading up to this war, it is not easy to give an exact date when the war, or the 'Dutch Revolt', actually started. The first open violence that would lead to the war was the 1566 iconoclasm known as the '''Iconoclastic Fury''' ({{lang|nl|[[Beeldenstorm]]}}), and sometimes the first Spanish repressions of the riots (i.e. [[battle of Oosterweel]], 1567) are considered the starting point. Most accounts cite the 1568 invasions of armies of mercenaries paid by William of Orange as the official start of the war; this article adopts that point of view. Alternatively, the start of the war is sometimes set at the [[capture of Brielle]] by the Gueux in 1572.}} broke out against rule by Roman Catholic Spain, sparking the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Led by [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], independence was declared in the 1581 [[Act of Abjuration]]. The revolt resulted in the establishment of an de facto independent Protestant republic in the north by [[Treaty of Antwerp (1609)]], although Spain did not officially recognize Dutch independence until 1648. The eight decades of war came at a massive human cost, with an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 victims, of which 350,000 to 400,000 were civilians killed by disease and what would later be considered war crimes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victimario Hist\u00f3rico Militar|url=http://remilitari.com/guias/victimario9.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]] had been important hubs of the European maritime trade network for centuries prior to Spanish rule.

The rivalry with Portugal, however, was not entirely economic: from 1580, after the death of the King of Portugal, [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian I]], and much of the Portuguese nobility in the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]], the Portuguese crown had been joined to that of Spain in an \"[[Iberian Union]]\" under the heir of Emperor Charles V, [[Philip II of Spain]]. By attacking Portuguese overseas possessions, the Dutch forced Spain to divert financial and military resources away from its attempt to quell Dutch independence.<ref>Scammel (1989), p.20.</ref> Thus began the several decade-long [[Dutch-Portuguese War]].\n\nIn 1594, the ''[[Compagnie van Verre]]'' (\"Company of Far Lands\") was founded in Amsterdam, with the aim of sending two fleets to the spice islands of [[Maluku islands|Maluku]].<ref>Boxer (1965), p.22.</ref> The first fleet sailed in 1596 and returned in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage.

The charter awarded to the Company by the States-General granted it sole rights, for an initial period of 21&nbsp;years, to Dutch trade and navigation east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and west of the [[Straits of Magellan]].

It was largely fought on the European continent, but war was also conducted against Phillip II's overseas territories, including Spanish colonies and the Portuguese metropoles, colonies, [[Factory (trading post)#Portuguese Feitorias (c. 1445)|trading posts]] and [[Fortification|forts]] belonging at that time to the King of Spain and Portugal.\n\nThe Netherlands became part of the domains of the [[Habsburg Spain|'Spanish branch']] of the Habsburg dynasty when Emperor Charles V divided the holdings of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg Empire]] following his abdication in 1555. In 1566, the [[Dutch revolt]] erupted and in 1568 the [[Dutch Republic]] embarked on the long, torturous path of the Eighty Years' War (also known as the [[Dutch War of Independence]]) and began the invasion and looting of Spanish (and, later, Portuguese) colonies in the Americas and of Asia, including an attempted invasion of the [[Philippines]] (then part of the [[Spanish East Indies]]).\n\n[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazili\u00eb Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Olinda]], Pernambuco, Dutch Brazil]]\nFrom 1517, the port of [[Lisbon]] in [[Portugal]] was the main European market for products from India that was attended by other nations to purchase their needs. But as a result of Portugal's incorporation in the Iberian Union with Spain by Philip II in 1580, all Portuguese territories were thereafter Spanish Habsburg branch territory, and thus all Portuguese markets were closed to the United Provinces. Thus, in 1595, the Dutch decided to set sail on their own to acquire products for themselves, making use of the \"secret\" knowledge of the Portuguese trade routes, which [[Cornelis de Houtman]] had managed to acquire in Lisbon.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Vidal, Prudencio. (1888)</ref>\n\nPursuing their quest for alternative routes to Asia for trade, the Dutch were disrupting the Spanish-Portuguese trade, and they eventually ranged as far afield as the Philippines. The Dutch sought to dominate the commercial sea trade in Southeast Asia, going so far in pursuit of this goal as to engage in what other nations and powers considered to be little more than piratical activities.\n\n[[File:Victor Meirelles - 'Battle of Guararapes', 1879, oil on canvas, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, Rio de Janeiro 2.jpg|thumb|The Portuguese victory at the [[Second Battle of Guararapes|Battle of Guararapes]], ended Dutch presence in Brazil.]]\nThe joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, with King Phillip II's enemies becoming Portugal's enemies as well. War with the Dutch led to attacks on most of Portugal's far-flung [[Portuguese Empire#Southeast Asia and the spice trade|trading network]] in and around [[Asia]], including Ceylon (modern [[Sri Lanka]]), and [[History of Goa#Decline|Goa]], as well as [[Portuguese Empire#Iberian Union and rivalry with the Protestant Powers (1580\u20131663)|attacks upon her commercial interests]] in [[Nanban trade|Japan]], [[Portuguese Empire#Age of Discovery (1415\u20131542)|Africa]] (especially [[Elmina Castle#Control by other European nations|Mina]]), and [[South America]]. Even though the Portuguese had never been able to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they had been able to keep the [[Portuguese Ceylon|coastal regions]] under their control for a considerable time before the coming of the Dutch in war. Portugal's South American colony, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], was partially conquered by both [[France]] and the United Provinces.\n\nIn the 17th century, the \"[[Groot Desseyn|Grand Design]]\" of the [[Dutch West India Company|West India Company]] involved attempting to corner the international trade in sugar by attacking Portuguese colonies in Brazil and Africa, seizing both the sugarcane plantations and the slave ports needed to resupply their labour. Although weakened by the [[Iberian Union]] with Spain, whose attention was focused elsewhere, the Portuguese were able to fight off the initial assault before the [[Battle of Matanzas Bay]] provided the WIC with the funds needed for a successful operation. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Johan Maurits]] was appointed governor of \"[[Dutch Brazil|New Holland]]\" and landed at [[Recife]] in January 1637. In a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from [[Sergipe]] on the south to [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds de Maranh\u00e3o|Maranh\u00e3o]] in the north. The WIC also succeeded in conquering [[Goree]], [[Elmina Castle]], Saint Thomas, and [[Luanda]] on the west coast of Africa. Both regions were also used as bases for Dutch privateers plundering Portuguese and Spanish trade routes. The dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640 and Maurits's recall in 1643 led to increased resistance from the Portuguese colonists who still made up a majority of the Brazilian settlers. The Dutch were finally overcome during the 1650s but managed to receive 4 million [[Portuguese real|reis]] (63 [[metric tons]] of gold) in exchange for extinguishing their claims over Brazil in the [[1661 Treaty of the Hague]].\n\n==== Asia ====\n[[File: Dutch and Portuguese in Asia c 1665.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Primary Dutch and Portuguese settlements in Asia, c. 1665.

The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless, the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so.<ref>Boxer (1969), p.23.</ref> [[Ambon Island|Amboina]] was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on [[Malacca]] the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favourable monsoon winds.<ref>Boxer (1965), p.189.</ref> The Dutch found what they were looking for in [[Jakarta]], conquered by [[Jan Coen]] in 1619, later renamed [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] after the putative Dutch ancestors the Batavians, and which would become the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. [[Malacca]] [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|finally succumbed in 1641]] (after a second attempt to capture it), [[Colombo]] in 1656, [[Ceylon]] in 1658, [[Nagappattinam]] in 1662 and [[Cranganore]] and [[Cochin]] in 1662.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n[[Goa]], the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was unsuccessfully attacked by the Dutch in 1603 and 1610. Whilst the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture [[Macau]]<ref>Shipp, p.22.</ref> from where Portugal monopolized the lucrative [[Nanban trade|China-Japan trade]], the [[shogunate|Japanese shogunate's]] increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent [[sakoku|''sakoku'' policy]], from 1639 till 1854 (215 years) the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to [[Hirado]] and then from 1641 at [[Deshima]].

The Dutch had a large force at their disposal but when they tried to take [[Manila]], they were defeated at the [[Battles of La Naval de Manila]]. After this defeat, the Dutch abandoned their efforts to take Manila and the Philippines.\n\nBetween 1602 and 1796, the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] sent almost a million [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] to work in the Asia trade.<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/22635/11546101681netherlands_voc_archives.doc/netherlands%2Bvoc%2Barchives.doc Nomination VOC archives for Memory of the World Register]</ref> The majority died of disease or made their way back to Europe, but some of them made the Indies their new home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchmalaysia.net/press/Easternization.html|title=dutchmalaysia.net|accessdate=18 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814022910/http://www.dutchmalaysia.net/press/Easternization.html|archive-date=14 August 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Interaction between the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and native population mainly took place in [[Sri Lanka]] and the modern [[Islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Islands]].

Under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]], New Netherland was ceded to England in exchange for the English settlements in Suriname, which had been conquered by Dutch forces earlier that year. Though the Dutch would again take New Netherland in 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, it was returned to England the following year, thereby ending Dutch rule in continental North America, but leaving behind a large Dutch community under English rule that persisted with its language, church and customs until the mid-18th century.<ref>Taylor (2001), p.260</ref> In South America, the Dutch seized [[Cayenne (Dutch colony)|Cayenne]] from the French in 1658 and drove off a French attempt to retake it a year later.

The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 saw the Dutch [[William III of England|William of Orange]] ascend to the throne, and win the English, Scottish, and Irish crowns, ending eighty years of rivalry between the Netherlands and England, while the rivalry with France remained strong.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain declared war on the Netherlands, the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], in which Britain seized the Dutch colony of Ceylon. Under the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], Ceylon was returned to the Netherlands and [[Negapatnam]] ceded to Britain.\n\n=== Napoleonic era (1795\u20131815) ===\n[[File:Grote partij bij het opperhoofd van Dejima.jpg|thumb|[[Dejima]] trading post in Japan, c. 1805]]\nIn 1795, the French revolutionary army invaded the Dutch Republic and turned the nation into a satellite of France, named the [[Batavian Republic]]. Britain, which was at war with France, soon moved to occupy Dutch colonies in Asia, [[Battle of Muizenberg|South Africa]] and the Caribbean.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Amiens]] signed by Britain and France in 1802, the Cape Colony and the islands of the [[Dutch West Indies]] that the British had seized were returned to the Republic. [[Ceylon]] was not returned to the Dutch and was made a British [[Crown Colony]]. After the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and France again in 1803, the British [[Battle of Blaauwberg|retook]] the Cape Colony. The British also [[Invasion of Java (1811)|invaded and captured the island of Java in 1811]].\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon dissolved the Batavian Republic and established a monarchy with his brother, [[Louis Bonaparte]], on the throne as King of the Netherlands. Louis was removed from power by Napoleon in 1810, and the country was ruled directly from France until its liberation in 1813. The following year, the independent Netherlands signed the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] with Britain. All the colonies Britain had seized were returned to the Netherlands, with the exception of the [[Cape Colony]], [[Guyana]] and [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n=== Post-Napoleonic era (1815\u20131945) ===\n[[File:Dutch East Indies Expansion.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.45|Expansion of the Dutch East Indies in the Indonesian Archipelago]]\n[[File:KaartNederlandsekolonien.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Dutch colonial possessions around 1840.

For the first time since the [[declaration of independence]] from Spain in 1581, the Dutch were reunited with the [[Southern Netherlands]] in a constitutional monarchy, the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The union lasted just 15&nbsp;years. In 1830, a [[Belgian Revolution|revolution]] in the southern half of the country led to the ''de facto'' independence of the new state of [[Belgium]].\n\nThe bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp110\">{{cite book| last =Ricklefs | first =M.C. | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition | publisher =MacMillan | year =1991 | location =London | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 | page =110 }}</ref> and its territorial possessions were nationalized as the [[Dutch East Indies]].\nAnglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of [[Singapore]], which had been [[Founding of modern Singapore|ceded to the British East India Company]] in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan's predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]]. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded [[Malacca]] and their bases in India to the British, and recognized the British claim to Singapore. In return, the British handed over [[Bencoolen Presidency|Bencoolen]] and agreed not to sign treaties with rulers in the \"islands south of the Straits of Singapore\". Thus the [[Maritime Southeast Asia|archipelago]] was divided into two spheres of influence: a British one, on the [[Malay Peninsula]], and a Dutch one in the East Indies.<ref>SarDesai, pp.92\u201393.</ref>\n[[File:VOC.svg|upright=0.4|thumb|left|Logo of the VOC]]\nFor most of the Dutch East Indies history, and that of the VOC before it, Dutch control over their territories was often tenuous, but was expanded over the course of the 19th century. Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become the boundaries of modern-day Indonesia. Although highly populated and agriculturally productive, [[Java]] was under Dutch domination for most of the 350&nbsp;years of the combined VOC and Dutch East Indies era, many areas remained independent for much of this time including [[Aceh]], [[Lombok]], [[Bali]] and [[Borneo]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Witton | first =Patrick | title =Indonesia | publisher =Lonely Planet | year =2003 | location =Melbourne | pages =23\u201325| isbn=1-74059-154-2 }}; {{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=A. |year=1994 |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/3 3\u20134] |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=1-86373-635-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/3 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1871, all of the Dutch possessions on the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] were [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870-1871|sold to Britain]].\n\nThe Dutch West India company was abolished in 1791, and its colonies in Suriname and the Caribbean brought under the direct rule of the state.<ref>Rogozinski (1999), pp.213</ref> The economies of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean had been based on the smuggling of goods and slaves into [[Spanish America]], but with the end of the slave trade in 1814 and the independence of the new nations of South and Central America from Spain, profitability rapidly declined.

Dutch forces eventually re-occupied most of the colonial territory and a guerrilla struggle ensued. The majority of Indonesians, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 international opinion, favored independence, and in December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. Under the terms of the 1949 agreement, [[Western New Guinea]] remained under the auspices of [[Netherlands New Guinea]]. The new Indonesian government under President Sukarno [[West New Guinea dispute|pressured]] for the territory to come under Indonesian control as Indonesian nationalists initially intended.

The former colonies were granted autonomy, save for certain matters including defense, foreign affairs and citizenship, which were the responsibility of the Realm. In 1969, [[1969 Cura\u00e7ao uprising|unrest in Cura\u00e7ao]] led to Dutch marines being sent to quell rioting. In 1973, negotiations started in Suriname for independence, and full independence was granted in 1975, with 60,000 emigrants taking the opportunity of moving to the Netherlands. In 1986, [[Aruba]] was allowed to secede from the Netherlands Antilles federation, and was pressured by the Netherlands to move to independence within ten years.

Some of the most prominent example of these architecture is the former governor's mansion in Galle, currently known as [[Amangalla|Amangalla Hotel]] and the Old Dutch Reformed Church. In the capital Colombo, many of the Dutch and Portuguese architecture around [[Fort (Colombo)|The Fort]] have been demolished during the British period, few of the remaining include [[Old Colombo Dutch Hospital]] and [[Wolvendaal Church]].\n\nDuring the period of Dutch colonisation in [[South Africa]], a distinctive type of architecture, known as [[Cape Dutch architecture]], was developed. These style of architecture can be found in historical towns such as [[Stellenbosch]], [[Swellendam]], [[Tulbagh]] and [[Graaff-Reinet]]. In the former Dutch capital of Cape Town, nearly nothing from the VOC era have survived except the [[Castle of Good Hope]].\n\nAlthough the Dutch already started erecting buildings shortly after they arrived on the shores of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], most Dutch-built constructions still standing today in Indonesia stem from the 19th and 20th centuries. Forts from the colonial era, used for defense purposes, still line a number of major coastal cities across the archipelago. The largest number of surviving Dutch buildings can be found on Java and Sumatra, particularly in cities such as [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Semarang]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Cirebon]], [[Pasuruan]], [[Bukittinggi]], [[Sawahlunto]], [[Medan]], [[Padang]] and [[Malang]]. There are also significant examples of 17\u201319th century Dutch architecture around [[Banda Neira]], [[Nusa Laut]] and [[Saparua]], the former main spices islands, which due to limited economic development have retained many of its colonial elements. Another prominent example of Dutch colonial architecture is [[Fort Rotterdam]] in [[Makassar]]. The earlier Dutch construction mostly replicate the architecture style in the Homeland (such as [[Toko Merah]]). However these buildings were unsuitable to tropical climate and expensive to maintain. And as a result the Dutch officials begun to adapt to the tropical condition by applying native elements such as wide-open veranda, ventilation and indigenous high pitch roofing into their [[Dutch Indies country houses|villas]]. \"In the beginning (of the Dutch presence), Dutch construction on Java was based on colonial architecture which was modified according to the tropical and local cultural conditions,\" Indonesian art and design professor Pamudji Suptandar wrote.<ref>{{in lang|id}}Suptandar, Pamudji ''Tokoh Pejuang Kemerdekaan, Pembangunan, Dan Pendidikan.''

At the turn of the 20th century and partially due to the [[Dutch Ethical Policy]], the number of Dutch people migrating to the colony grew with economic expansion. The increasing number of middle class population led to the development of Garden Suburbs in major city across the Indies, many of the houses were built in various style ranging from the Indies style, [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] to modern [[Art Deco]].

Several famous architect such as [[Wolff Schoemaker]] and [[Henri Maclaine Pont]] also made an attempt to modernize indigenous architecture, resulting several unique design such as Pohsarang Church and [[Bandung Institute of Technology]]. The largest stock of these Art Deco building can be found in the city of Bandung, which \"architecturally\" can considered the most European city in Indonesia.\n\nSince Indonesia's independence, few governments have shown interest in the conservation of historical buildings. Many architecturally grand buildings have been torn down in the past decades to erect shopping centres or office buildings e.g. [[Hotel des Indes (Batavia)]], [[Harmony Society, Batavia]]. Presently, however, more Indonesians have become aware of the value of preserving their old buildings.\n\n<blockquote>\"A decade ago, most people thought I was crazy when they learned of my efforts to save the old part of Jakarta. A few years later, the negative voices started to disappear, and now many people are starting to think with me: how are we going to save our city. In the past using the negative sentiment towards the colonial era was often used as an excuse to disregard protests against the demolition of historical buildings. An increasing number of people now see the old colonial buildings as part of their city\u2019s overall heritage rather than focusing on its colonial aspect.\", leading Indonesian architect and conservationist Budi Lim said.<ref>Lim, Budy ''The past in the present: architecture in Indonesia.''

A variety of other designs have been employed in the past.\n\n====Split gate====\nThe earliest{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} common style was an upward-swinging window combined with a downward swinging tailgate. Both were manually operated. This configuration generally prevailed from the earliest origins of the wagon body style in the 1920s through the 1940s. It remained in use through to 1960 on several models offered by Ford, including the 1957-58 Del Rio two-door wagon. This style was later adopted on aftermarket [[camper shell]]s for [[pickup truck]]s and [[coup\u00e9 utility]] cars, as both already types of vehicle often had a bottom half tailgate as an original feature.\n\n====Retractable window====\nIn the early 1950s, tailgates with hand-cranked roll-down rear windows began to appear. Later in the decade, electric power was applied to the tailgate window\u2014it could be operated from the driver's seat, as well as by the keyhole in the rear door. By the early 1960s, this arrangement was common on both full-size and compact wagons.\n* '''Side hinge:''' A side hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats. This was later supplanted by the dual-hinged tailgate.\n[[File:Flickr - DVS1mn - 63 Studebaker Lark Daytona Wagonaire.jpg|thumb|right|1963 Studebaker Wagonaire with rear roof retracted]]\n\n====Retractable roof====\nThese have a retractable rear roof section as well as a conventional rear tailgate which folded down to carry tall objects that would not fit otherwise. The configuration appeared on the [[Studebaker]] [[Studebaker Wagonaire|Wagonaire]] station wagon and 2003 [[GMC Envoy|GMC Envoy XUV]].\n\n====Dual and tri-operating gates====\nFord's full-size station wagons for the [[United States]] market introduced a system marketed as \"Magic Doorgate\" in 1966 \u2014 a conventional tailgate with retracting rear glass, where the tailgate could either fold down or pivot open on a side hinge \u2014 with the rear window retracted in either case. Competitors marketed their versions as a ''Drop and Swing'' or ''Dual Action Tailgate.''<ref name=\"pm\"/> For 1969, Ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the door pivoted open on its side hinge, marketing the system, which had been engineered by [[Donald N. Frey]]<ref name=\"time1\">{{cite journal|url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843628,00.html |title=The Thinker (Detroit Style) |journal=Time |date=April 21, 1967 |accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> as the \"Three-Way Magic Doorgate\". Similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate station wagons from GM, Ford, Chrysler, and AMC. GM added a notch in the rear bumper that acted as a step plate; to fill the gap, a small portion of bumper was attached to the door-gate. When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a \"step\" to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper \"whole\".\n[[File:1971 Buick Estate wagon rear.jpg|thumb|right|1971 [[Buick Estate Wagon]] with \"clam shell\" tailgate]]\n\n====Clam shell====\nFull-size General Motors 1971\u20131976 wagons \u2014 the [[Chevrolet Kingswood Estate|Chevrolet Kingswood, Townsman, Brookwood, Bel Air, Impala, and Caprice Estates]]; [[Pontiac Grand Safari|Pontiac Safari and Grand Safari]]; [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]], and the [[Buick Estate]] models \u2014 featured a 'clam shell' design marketed as the ''Glide-away'' tail-gate, also called a \"disappearing\" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clam shell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate.<ref name=\"popsci\">{{cite journal|title=The '71 Wagons, Big Changes Coming Up |journal=Popular Science |date=October 1970 |pages=74\u201375 |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |first2=Jim |last2=Dunne |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=%22glide+away%22+tailgate#v=onepage&q=%22glide%20away%22%20tailgate&f=false |accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> The power operation of both upper glass and lower tail-gate became standard equipment in later model years. Station wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat \u2014 and could accommodate a 4 x 8' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded. The clam shell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door \u2014 for example, in a closed garage. Subsequent GM full-size wagons reverted to the door-gate style for its full-size wagons.\n\n====Lift-gate====\nA simplified, one-piece lift-gate on smaller wagons. Subsequent generation of GM's full-size station wagons returned to the upward-lifting rear window as had been used in the 1940s.\n[[File:Renault Laguna II Grandtour Phase I Heck.JPG|thumb|right|Renault Laguna II Estate with swing-up window]]\n* '''Swing-up window:''' An upward-lifting, full-height, full-width rear door, where the window on the rear door can be opened independently from the rear door itself. The window is also opened upwards and is held on pneumatic struts. The [[Renault Laguna]] II estate and [[Ford Taurus]] wagon featured this arrangement.\n* '''Fold-up number plate:''' Wagons (including the [[Volvo Amazon]] wagon, early models of the Range-Rover, and the [[Subaru Baja]]) had an upward folding hinged plate attached to the lower tail-gate of the split rear door. When the tailgate was folded down, the plate hung down and remained readable. The wagon versions of the [[Citroen DS]], variously called the Break, Familiale or Safari, had a different solution: two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position.\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Safety equipment===\n[[Cargo barrier]]s may be used to prevent unsecured cargo from causing injuries in the event of sudden deceleration, collision, or a [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Byard |first=RW |last2=Bourne |first2=AJ |last3=James |first3=R |journal=Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health |date=August 1999|title=Childhood deaths and cargo barriers in cars |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |pmid=10457305 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=409\u201310 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1754.1999.00379.x}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Performance models ===\nThe 1994 [[Audi RS2]], developed in conjunction with Porsche, is considered the world's first performance station wagon.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Porsche Helped Audi Create the World's First Performance Wagon |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a10297476/audi-rs2-history/ |website=www.roadandtrack.com |accessdate=26 March 2020 |date=12 July 2017}}</ref> Prior to this, performance models of station wagons included the 1970 [[Ford Falcon (XY)]] 'Grand Sport' pack,<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand Sports |url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/grand_sports.html |website=www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> the 1973 [[Chevrolet Chevelle#Third generation (1973\u20131977)|Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS-454]] and the 1992 [[BMW M5#E34|BMW M5 (E34)]].\n\nSeveral German manufacturers have produced estate versions of high-performance models, such as the [[Audi RS4]], [[Audi RS6]], [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205)|Mercedes-AMG C63]], [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W213)|Mercedes-AMG E63]], [[BMW M5#E60|BMW M5 (E60/E61)]], [[Volkswagen Golf R]] and [[Volkswagen Passat (B6)|Volkswagen Passat R36]] wagons.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World's Best Station Wagons - Gear Patrol |url=https://gearpatrol.com/2015/08/17/worlds-best-station-wagons/ |website=www.gearpatrol.com |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=17 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Is this Super Rare BMW M5 Wagon Worth $130,000? |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a11327600/super-rare-bmw-m5-wagon-for-sale/ |website=www.roadandtrack.com |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=3 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E61 BMW M5 Touring: One of the best M cars of all time |url=https://www.bmwblog.com/2016/01/22/e61-bmw-m5-touring-one-of-the-best-m-cars-of-all-time/ |website=www.bmwblog.com |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical\n| image1   = Ford Model T Station Wagon, 1914 - Hiller Aviation Museum - San Carlos, California - DSC03225.jpg\n| caption1 = Wooden-bodied station wagon: 1914 [[Ford Model T]]\n| image2   = 1948 Crosley Station Wagon.jpg\n| caption2 = Steel-bodied station wagon: 1948 [[Crosley#Crosley CC Four (1946\u20131948)|Crosley CC]]\n}}\n\nThe first station wagons were built in around 1910, by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the Ford Model T chassis.<ref name=\"www.stationwagon.com\">{{cite web |title=A Short History of Station Wagons in the USA |url=http://www.stationwagon.com/history.html |website=www.stationwagon.com |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> They were originally called \"depot hacks\" because they worked around train ''depots'' as ''hacks'' (short for [[hackney carriage]], as taxicabs were then known).<ref name=\"www.coolridesonline.net\">{{cite web |title=The History Of The Station Wagon |url=https://www.coolridesonline.net/news-blog/the-history-of-the-station-wagon/ |website=www.coolridesonline.net |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> They also came to be known as \"carryalls\" and \"suburbans\".<ref name=\"www.stationwagon.com\"/>\n\nEventually, car manufacturers began producing their own station wagon and estate designs.

Prior to 1956, the third row seats were forward facing.\n\nChrysler's 1957 models had a roof too low to permit a forward-facing seat in the cargo area,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} so a rear-facing seat was used for the third row.\n\nGeneral Motors adopted the rear-facing third row for most models during 1959-1971 and 1977\u20131996. However the 1964\u20131972 [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]] and 1964\u20131969 [[Buick Sport Wagon]] featured raised roof-lines beginning above the second-row seat and continuing all the way to the rear tailgate, resulting in the third row of seats being forward-facing. General Motors also used forward-facing seats for the third row in the 1971\u20131976 [[#clamshell|clam shell wagons]].\n\nThe Ford and Mercury full-size wagons built after 1964 were available with four rows of seats, with the rear two rows in the cargo area and facing each other. The third and fourth rows were design for two people each (although these seats were quite narrow in later models), giving a total seating capacity of ten people.\n\nThe trend since the 1980s for smaller station wagon bodies has limited the seating to two rows, resulting in a total capacity of five people, or six people if a bench front seat is used.

It had a seating capacity of eight people, consisting of two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in the cargo area. The 'Familiale' version had a front bench seat, a forward-facing three-space bench seat in the middle and a folding forward-facing three-seat bench in the rear, providing a versatile nine-seat car. The Citro\u00ebn ID also had a two-part tailgate and [[hydropneumatic suspension]], which allowed a self-levelling ride-height and automatic brake biasing regardless of the load carried. The car could also 'kneel' to the ground for easy loading of heavy or large items. The successors to the ID, the [[Citro\u00ebn CX]] and [[Citro\u00ebn XM]] continued to be amongst the largest estate cars produced in Europe, but the model was discontinued in 2000 and an estate version was not available for its [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] successor.\n\nThe [[Peugeot 404]], introduced in 1960, offered a conventional alternative to the innovative Citro\u00ebns for buyers wanting a large estate car. Its replacement, the [[Peugeot 505|505]] was available in both five-seat and seven-seat 'Familiale' versions.

Both were manually operated. This configuration generally prevailed from the earliest origins of the wagon body style in the 1920s through the 1940s. It remained in use through to 1960 on several models offered by Ford, including the 1957-58 Del Rio two-door wagon.

Later in the decade, electric power was applied to the tailgate window\u2014it could be operated from the driver's seat, as well as by the keyhole in the rear door. By the early 1960s, this arrangement was common on both full-size and compact wagons.\n* '''Side hinge:''' A side hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats.

When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a \"step\" to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper \"whole\".\n[[File:1971 Buick Estate wagon rear.jpg|thumb|right|1971 [[Buick Estate Wagon]] with \"clam shell\" tailgate]]\n\n====Clam shell====\nFull-size General Motors 1971\u20131976 wagons \u2014 the [[Chevrolet Kingswood Estate|Chevrolet Kingswood, Townsman, Brookwood, Bel Air, Impala, and Caprice Estates]]; [[Pontiac Grand Safari|Pontiac Safari and Grand Safari]]; [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]], and the [[Buick Estate]] models \u2014 featured a 'clam shell' design marketed as the ''Glide-away'' tail-gate, also called a \"disappearing\" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clam shell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate.<ref name=\"popsci\">{{cite journal|title=The '71 Wagons, Big Changes Coming Up |journal=Popular Science |date=October 1970 |pages=74\u201375 |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |first2=Jim |last2=Dunne |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=%22glide+away%22+tailgate#v=onepage&q=%22glide%20away%22%20tailgate&f=false |accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref> The power operation of both upper glass and lower tail-gate became standard equipment in later model years.

The clam shell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door \u2014 for example, in a closed garage.

When the tailgate was folded down, the plate hung down and remained readable. The wagon versions of the [[Citroen DS]], variously called the Break, Familiale or Safari, had a different solution: two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position.\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Safety equipment===\n[[Cargo barrier]]s may be used to prevent unsecured cargo from causing injuries in the event of sudden deceleration, collision, or a [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Byard |first=RW |last2=Bourne |first2=AJ |last3=James |first3=R |journal=Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health |date=August 1999|title=Childhood deaths and cargo barriers in cars |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |pmid=10457305 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=409\u201310 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1754.1999.00379.x}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Performance models ===\nThe 1994 [[Audi RS2]], developed in conjunction with Porsche, is considered the world's first performance station wagon.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Porsche Helped Audi Create the World's First Performance Wagon |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a10297476/audi-rs2-history/ |website=www.roadandtrack.com |accessdate=26 March 2020 |date=12 July 2017}}</ref> Prior to this, performance models of station wagons included the 1970 [[Ford Falcon (XY)|Ford Falcon (XY)]] 'Grand Sport' pack,<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand Sports |url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/grand_sports.html |website=www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> the 1973 [[Chevrolet_Chevelle#Third_generation_(1973\u20131977)|Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS-454]] and the 1992 [[BMW M5#E34|BMW M5 (E34)]].\n\nSeveral German manufacturers have produced estate versions of high-performance models, such as the [[Audi RS4]], [[Audi RS6]], [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205)|Mercedes-AMG C63]], [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W213)|Mercedes-AMG E63]], [[BMW M5#E60|BMW M5 (E60/E61)]], [[Volkswagen Golf R]] and [[Volkswagen Passat (B6)|Volkswagen Passat R36]] wagons.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World's Best Station Wagons - Gear Patrol |url=https://gearpatrol.com/2015/08/17/worlds-best-station-wagons/ |website=www.gearpatrol.com |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=17 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Is this Super Rare BMW M5 Wagon Worth $130,000? |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a11327600/super-rare-bmw-m5-wagon-for-sale/ |website=www.roadandtrack.com |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=3 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E61 BMW M5 Touring: One of the best M cars of all time |url=https://www.bmwblog.com/2016/01/22/e61-bmw-m5-touring-one-of-the-best-m-cars-of-all-time/ |website=www.bmwblog.com |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=22 January 2016}}</ref> \n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical\n| image1   = Ford Model T Station Wagon, 1914 - Hiller Aviation Museum - San Carlos, California - DSC03225.jpg\n| caption1 = Wooden-bodied station wagon: 1914 [[Ford Model T]]\n| image2   = 1948 Crosley Station Wagon.jpg\n| caption2 = Steel-bodied station wagon: 1948 [[Crosley#Crosley CC Four (1946\u20131948)|Crosley CC]]\n}}\n\nThe first station wagons were built in around 1910, by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the Ford Model T chassis.<ref name=\"www.stationwagon.com\">{{cite web |title=A Short History of Station Wagons in the USA |url=http://www.stationwagon.com/history.html |website=www.stationwagon.com |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> They were originally called \"depot hacks\" because they worked around train ''depots'' as ''hacks'' (short for [[hackney carriage]], as taxicabs were then known).<ref name=\"www.coolridesonline.net\">{{cite web |title=The History Of The Station Wagon |url=https://www.coolridesonline.net/news-blog/the-history-of-the-station-wagon/ |website=www.coolridesonline.net |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> They also came to be known as \"carryalls\" and \"suburbans\".<ref name=\"www.stationwagon.com\"/>\n\nEventually, car manufacturers began producing their own station wagon and estate designs.

Prior to 1956, the third row seats were forward facing.\n\nChrysler's 1957 models had a roof too low to permit a forward-facing seat in the cargo area,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} so a rear-facing seat was used for the third row.\n\nGeneral Motors adopted the rear-facing third row for most models during 1959-1971 and 1977-1996. However the 1964\u20131972 [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]] and 1964\u20131969 [[Buick Sport Wagon]] featured raised roof-lines beginning above the second-row seat and continuing all the way to the rear tailgate, resulting in the third row of seats being forward-facing. General Motors also used forward-facing seats for the third row in the 1971\u20131976 [[#clamshell|clam shell wagons]].\n\nThe Ford and Mercury full-size wagons built after 1964 were available with four rows of seats, with the rear two rows in the cargo area and facing each other. The third and fourth rows were design for two people each (although these seats were quite narrow in later models), giving a total seating capacity of ten people.\n\nThe trend since the 1980s for smaller station wagon bodies has limited the seating to two rows, resulting in a total capacity of five people, or six people if a bench front seat is used. Since the 1990s, full-size station wagons have been largely replaced by SUVs with three-row seating, such as the [[Chevrolet Suburban]], [[Ford Expedition]], and [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class]].<ref name=\"motortrend.com\">{{cite web |title=2013 Mercedes-Benz GL450 vs. 2012 Mercedes-Benz E350 4Matic Wagon |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/overview/1301_2013_mercedes_benz_gl450_vs_2012_e350_4matic_wagon/ |website=www.motortrend.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Two-door wagons====\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical\n| image1   = Merc2drwagon.jpg\n| caption1 = 1958 [[Mercury Commuter]] hardtop\n| image2   = Vega wagon.jpg\n| caption2 = 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega]] Kammback\n}}\n\nThe first two-door station wagon was the 1946 [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Automotive History: The Short And Odd Life Of The Two Door Station Wagon |url= http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-the-short-and-odd-life-of-the-two-door-station-wagon/ |website=www.curbsideclassic.com |accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref> Other early two-door station wagons were the 1951 [[Nash Rambler]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Severson |first=Aaron |title=Fashionably Small: The Compact Nash Rambler |url= https://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/compact-nash-rambler/ |website=Ate Up With Motor |date=19 September 2009 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref> and the 1954 [[Studebaker Conestoga]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=Standard Guide to 1950s American Cars |year=2004 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=9780873498685 |page=[https://archive.org/details/standardguideto100john/page/235 235] |url= https://archive.org/details/standardguideto100john |url-access=registration |quote=1954 Studebaker Conestoga two-door station wagon. |accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref> In 1956, Studebaker introduced three new two-door wagons in Pelham, Parkview, and Pinehurst trims.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flory Jr. |first=J. \"Kelly\" |title=American Cars, 1946\u20131959: Every Model, Year by Year |year=2008 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786452309 |page=700 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m-k3ONS880cC&pg=PA700&dq=Studebaker+introduced+three+new+models+in+this+body+style+with+the+Pelham,+Parkview+and+Pinehurst+2-+door+station+wagons |accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nGeneral Motors began producing two-door station wagons in 1955 with the \"Chevrolet Handyman\" and the \"Pontiac Chieftan\".<ref>{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1955-1957 Pontiac Star Chief Safari |url= https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1955-1957-pontiac-star-chief-safari2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref> General Motors also introduced the sportier [[Chevrolet Nomad]] and [[Pontiac Safari]] to their lineup in 1955.

Since the 1930s, the term [[shooting-brake]] (originally a term for hunting vehicles) has been an alternative, if now rarely used, term for estate cars in the UK.\n\nLater estate cars were produced by vehicle manufacturers and include the 1937 [[Commer]] (based on the [[Hillman Minx#Pre-WWII Minx|Hillman Minx Magnificent]]),<ref>{{cite web |title=Improved Commer 8-cwt.

The majority of these models were two-door wagons and several models were built on the chassis of relatively small cars.\n\nManufacturers often chose a specific model name to apply to all their estate cars as a marketing exercise \u2014 for example [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] used the Countryman name and Morris estates were called Travellers. Some estates were closely derived from existing commercial [[van]] models, such as the [[Austin A35|Austin A30/35 Countryman]] and the [[Hillman Husky]]. Others, such as the Morris Travellers, the [[Austin Cambridge|Austin Cambridge Countryman]] and the [[Standard Ten|Standard Ten Companion]] were bespoke.\n\nRover and Austin produced 4\u00d74 canvas-topped utility vehicles in the 1950s that were available in estate car body styles that were sold as \"Station Wagons\". They incorporated better seating and trim than standard editions with options such as heaters. Early advertising for the Land Rover version took the name literally, showing the vehicle collecting people and goods from a [[railway station]].\n\nDespite the popularity of station wagons in America, station wagon offerings in the U.K. from Ford and Vauxhall were limited to factory-approved aftermarket conversions of the [[Ford Consul]] and [[Vauxhall Cresta]], until the factory-built [[Vauxhall Victor#F Series Victor|Vauxhall Victor]] wagon was introduced in 1958.\n\n====1960s to present====\n[[File:1976 Ford Granada L 2000 Estate (14794742205).jpg|thumb|right|Ford Granada L Estate]]\nOne of the smallest estate cars ever made was the [[Mini#Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960\u201369)|Morris Mini Traveller / Austin Mini Countryman]], introduced in 1960.\n\nFord's first factory-built wagon was the 1963 [[Ford Cortina Mark 1|Ford Cortina]].\n\nThe 1967 [[Hillman Husky]] station wagon version of the [[Hillman Imp]] was unusual in being a rear-engined estate car.\n\nFord and Vauxhall produced factory-built estate variants of all three of their respective core models (small-, mid- and large-size cars) by the 1970s. The [[Vauxhall Victor#FD Series Victor, VX4/90 and Ventora|FD]]- and [[Vauxhall Victor#FE Series Victor, VX4/90, Ventora, VX1800 and VX2300|FE]]-Series Vauxhall Victors, built between 1966\u201378, were very large cars by British standards and featured estate models in the style of an American station wagon with front and rear bench seats and large-capacity petrol engines.\n\nOther estate cars sold in the United Kingdom included the [[Morris 1100]] (introduced in 1966), [[Vauxhall Viva]] (introduced 1967), [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] (introduced in 1968) and [[Vauxhall Chevette]] (introduced 1976).\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:2014 Mercedes-Benz C 250 CDI (S 204) Avantgarde station wagon (2015-07-09) 01.jpg|thumb|2014 [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W204)|Mercedes-Benz C Class]] station wagon]]\nGermany is the largest market for station wagons and estate cars in the world, with some 600-700,000 vehicles sold each year - amounting to 20% of all car sales.<ref>[http://www.auto.de/magazin/deutschland-einig-kombiland/ Deutschland einig Kombiland]</ref> German-designed station wagons and estates are currently produced by Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.

The Type 3's rear-engine layout was retained for the estate models, but the engine profile was flattened, resulting in a small car offering interior room, as well as trunk space in the front.

It had a seating capacity of eight people, consisting of two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in the cargo area. The 'Familiale' version had a front bench seat, a forward-facing three-space bench seat in the middle and a folding forward-facing three-seat bench in the rear, providing a versatile nine-seat car. The Citro\u00ebn ID also had a two-part tailgate and [[hydropneumatic suspension]], which allowed a self-levelling ride-height and automatic brake biasing regardless of the load carried. The car could also 'kneel' to the ground for easy loading of heavy or large items. The successors to the ID, the [[Citro\u00ebn CX]] and [[Citro\u00ebn XM]] continued to be amongst the largest estate cars produced in Europe, but the model was discontinued in 2000 and an estate version was not available for its [[Citro\u00ebn C6]] successor.\n\nThe [[Peugeot 404]], introduced in 1960, offered a conventional alternative to the innovative Citro\u00ebns for buyers wanting a large estate car. Its replacement, the [[Peugeot 505|505]] was available in both five-seat and seven-seat 'Familiale' versions. As with the Citro\u00ebns, changing demands in the French car market led to the end of the large Peugeot estate models in the mid-1990s, with the smaller [[Peugeot 406]] becoming the largest estate model in the range from 1995.

These cars were usually built on a longer [[wheelbase]] than their sedan counterparts, until the introduction of the [[Holden Commodore (VE)]] which switched to sharing the sedan's shorter wheelbase.\n\nFord ceased production of wagons in Australia when the [[Ford Falcon (BF)]] ended production in 2010, due to the introduction of the [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Ford Territory]] SUV.<ref>[http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/ford-falcon-wagon-dead-20100324-qwce.html Ford Falcon wagon dead], Drive.com.au, March 24, 2010</ref> Production of wagons in Australia ceased altogether in 2017 when the [[Holden Commodore (VF)]] ended production.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Station wagons}}\n* [[Hearse]]\n* [[Panel van]]\n* [[Hatchback]]\n* [[Shooting-brake]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|commonscat=yes|q=no|wikt=no}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euPi2qIOHYo|title=Why Station Wagons Are More Popular In Europe Than America|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=2019-10-17}}\n{{Automobile configuration}}\n\n[[Category:Station wagons| ]]\n[[Category:Car body styles]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: time consuming \u2192 time-consuming, locally- \u2192 locally , one year \u2192 one-year, 1945-1953 \u2192 1945\u20131953 (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon"}
