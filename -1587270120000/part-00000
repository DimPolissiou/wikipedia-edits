It was released in December 1970, after Lennon had issued three experimental albums with wife [[Yoko Ono]] and ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', a live performance in [[Toronto]] credited to the [[Plastic Ono Band]]. ''John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band'' was met with critical acclaim, with many praising the production, lyrics, and Lennon's performance. It peaked at number eight on the [[UK Albums Chart]]  and at number six on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. \n\nCo-produced by Lennon, Ono and [[Phil Spector]], the album contains a largely raw production sound with songs heavily influenced by Lennon's then-recent [[Primal therapy|primal scream therapy]]. Its lyrics reflect Lennon's personal issues and includes themes of child-parent abandonment and psychological suffering. The tracks were recorded in September and October 1970 at [[Ascot Sound Studios]] and [[Abbey Road Studios]], simultaneously with Ono's debut [[avant-garde]] solo album, ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]''. Both albums feature the same musicians (Lennon, [[Klaus Voormann]], and [[Ringo Starr]]) and production team and nearly identical cover artwork.\n\n''John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band'' came to be generally regarded as one of Lennon's finest solo albums. In 1987, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked it fourth in its list \"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\" and in 2012, ranked it number 23 in their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

Band''''' is the debut solo album by English musician [[John Lennon]]. It was released in December 1970, after Lennon had issued three experimental albums with wife [[Yoko Ono]] and ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', a live performance in [[Toronto]] credited to the [[Plastic Ono Band]]. ''John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band'' was met with critical acclaim, with many praising the production, lyrics, and Lennon's performance. It peaked at number eight on the [[UK Albums Chart]]  and at number six on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. \n\nCo-produced by Lennon, Ono and [[Phil Spector]], the album contains a largely raw production sound with songs heavily influenced by Lennon's then-recent [[Primal therapy|primal scream therapy]]. Its lyrics reflect Lennon's personal issues and includes themes of child-parent abandonment and psychological suffering. The tracks were recorded in September and October 1970 at [[Ascot Sound Studios]] and [[Abbey Road Studios]], simultaneously with Ono's debut [[avant-garde]] solo album, ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]''. Both albums feature the same musicians (Lennon, [[Klaus Voormann]], and [[Ringo Starr]]) and production team and nearly identical cover artwork.\n\n''John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band'' came to be generally regarded as one of Lennon's finest solo albums. In 1987, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked it fourth in its list \"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\" and in 2012, ranked it number 23 in their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].
