St Albans was the first major town on the old [[Roman Britain|Roman]] road of [[Watling Street]] for travellers heading north, and it became the Roman city of [[Verulamium]]. It is a historic [[market town]] and is now a [[dormitory town]] within the [[London commuter belt]] and the [[Greater London Built-up Area]].\n\n==Name==\nSt Albans takes its name from the first British saint, [[Saint Alban|Alban]].<ref name=EB1911/> The most elaborate version of his story, Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', relates that he lived in [[Verulamium]], sometime during the 3rd or 4th century, when Christians were suffering  persecution. Alban met a Christian priest fleeing from his persecutors  and sheltered him in his house, where he became so impressed with the priest's piety that he converted to Christianity. When the authorities searched Alban's house, he put on the priest's cloak and presented himself in place of his guest. Consequently, he was sentenced to endure the punishments that were to be inflicted upon the priest, unless he renounced Christianity. Alban refused and was taken for execution. In later legends, his head rolled downhill after execution and a well sprang up where it stopped.<ref name=\"Medieval St. Albans\">{{cite web|title=Medieval St. Albans|url=http://www.salbani.co.uk/Med%20Web/holywell_hill.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of St Albans}}\n\n===Celtic===\nThere was an [[Iron Age]] settlement known as Verulamium,<ref name=niblett>Rosalind Niblett, ''Roman Hertfordshire'', Wimborne: Dovecote Press, 1995</ref> [[Verlamion]], or Verlamio, near the site of the present city, the centre of [[Tasciovanus]]' power and a major centre of the [[Catuvellauni]] from about 20 BC until shortly after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of AD 43.<ref>John Wacher, 1976, ''The Towns of Roman Britain'', p. 202, both for Tasciovanus and the Catuvellauni.</ref> The name \"Verulamium\" is Celtic, meaning \"settlement over or by the marsh\".<ref name=niblett/> The town was on Prae Hill, 2&nbsp;km to the west of modern St Albans, now covered by the village of St Michael's, Verulamium Park and the [[Gorhambury]] Estate.<ref name=niblett/> Although excavations done in 1996 produced finds which included silver coins from the Roman Republican era dating from 90/80 bc evidence of trade with the republic and that a settlement already existed on the site 50 years before Julius Caesar attempted to invade Britain, yet it is believed that the tribal capital was moved to the site by Tasciovanus (around 25 to 5&nbsp;BC). [[Cunobelinus]] may have constructed [[Beech Bottom Dyke]], a defensive earthwork near the settlement whose significance is uncertain.\n\n===Roman===\n[[File:StAlbansRomanWall-PS01.JPG|thumb|Remains of Roman wall]]\nThe Roman city of [[Verulamium]], the second-largest town in [[Roman Britain]] after [[Londinium]], developed from the Celtic settlement<ref name=niblett/> and was granted{{by whom|date=October 2017}} the rank of ''[[municipium]]'' around AD&nbsp;50, meaning that its citizens had what were known as \"Latin Rights\", a lesser citizenship status than a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' possessed. It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of [[Boudica]] of the [[Iceni]] in 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt on her orders:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boudicca.shtml|title=BBC - History - Boudicca|publisher=}}</ref>excavations preceding the museum's new entrance done in 1996-7  within the centre of the Roman town gave archaeologists the chance to date a black ash layer to 60-65 AD, thus confirming the Roman written record. It grew steadily; by the early 3rd century, it covered an area of about {{convert|125|acre|km2}}, behind a deep ditch and wall. Verulamium contained a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], [[basilica]] and a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], much of which were damaged during two fires, one in 155 and the other in around 250. These were repaired and continued in use in the 4th century. The theatre was disused by the end of the 4th century. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain is found on the remnants of the forum (see [[Verulamium Forum inscription]]). The town was rebuilt in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] rather than [[timber]] at least twice over the next 150 years. Roman occupation ended between 400 and 450 AD\n\nThe body of St Alban was probably buried outside the city walls in a Roman cemetery near the present [[St Albans Cathedral|cathedral]]. His hillside grave became a place of pilgrimage. Recent investigation has uncovered a [[basilica]] there, indicating the oldest continuous site of Christian worship in Great Britain.

Victorian St Albans was small and had little industry. Its population grew more slowly than London, 8\u20139% per decade between 1801 and 1861, compared to the 31% per decade growth of London in the same period. The railway arrived relatively late, in 1858. In 1869 the extension of the city boundaries was opposed by the Earl of Verulam and many of the townsfolk, but there was rapid expansion and much building at the end of the century, and between 1891 and 1901 the population grew by 37%.<ref name=briggs>Asa Briggs, \"The Victorian City\", in \u2018\u2019Cathedral & City: St Albans Ancient and Modern\u2019\u2019, ed.

The new [[Diocese of St Albans|diocese]] was established in the same year, in the main from parts of the large [[Diocese of Rochester]].\n\nIn the inter-war years it became a centre for the [[electronics]] industry.

In 1887 the borough gained [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], following the elevation of St Albans Abbey to cathedral, and the boundary was adjusted to include part of the parish of [[Sandridge]].\n\nThe Local Government Act 1894 divided parishes that were partly within municipal boroughs. The parts of St Michael, St Peter and Sandridge within the borough became the new parishes of St Michael Urban, St Peter Urban and Sandridge Urban. The part of St Stephen within the borough was absorbed by the parish of St Albans. The parishes that were formed outside the borough, that is St Michael Rural, St Peter Rural, Sandridge Rural and the reduced St Stephen, became part of [[St Albans Rural District]] in 1894.\n\nIn 1898 the parish of St Albans absorbed St Michael Urban, St Peter Urban and Sandridge Urban so the parish and borough occupied the same area. In 1901 the population of the borough was 16,019, growing to 18,133 in 1911. St Albans expanded in 1913 by gaining parts of Sandridge Rural (241 acres), St Michael Rural (138 acres), St Peter Rural (992 acres) and St Stephen (335 acres). In 1921 the population of the enlarged borough was 25,593, growing to 28,624 in 1931. It expanded again in 1935 as part of a [[county review order]] gaining more of St Michael Rural (890 acres), St Peter Rural (436 acres) and St Stephen (712 acres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10213381/relationships |title=St Albans AP/CP through time &#124; Census tables with data for the Parish-level Unit |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref> The population of the borough was 44,098 in 1951 and 50,293 in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10213381/cube/TOT_POP |title=St Albans AP/CP through time &#124; Population Statistics &#124; Total Population |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Present====\n[[File:StAlbans-PSX1.JPG|thumb|St Albans viewed from the [[Clock Tower, St Albans|Clock Tower]]: French Row (to the left), Market Place (to the right), St Peter's Street and the tower of St Peter's Church (centre)]]\n{{Main|City and District of St Albans}}\nThe borough was abolished on 1 April 1974 and St Albans became part of the new, larger [[City and District of St Albans]].

St Albans was the first major town on the old [[Roman Britain|Roman]] road of [[Watling Street]] for travellers heading north, and it became the Roman city of [[Verulamium]]. It is a historic [[market town]] and is now a [[dormitory town]] within the [[London commuter belt]] and the [[Greater London Built-up Area]].\n\n==Name==\nSt Albans takes its name from the first British saint, [[Saint Alban|Alban]].<ref name=EB1911/> The most elaborate version of his story, Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', relates that he lived in [[Verulamium]], sometime during the 3rd or 4th century, when Christians were suffering  persecution. Alban met a Christian priest fleeing from his persecutors  and sheltered him in his house, where he became so impressed with the priest's piety that he converted to Christianity. When the authorities searched Alban's house, he put on the priest's cloak and presented himself in place of his guest. Consequently, he was sentenced to endure the punishments that were to be inflicted upon the priest, unless he renounced Christianity. Alban refused and was taken for execution. In later legends, his head rolled downhill after execution and a well sprang up where it stopped.<ref name=\"Medieval St. Albans\">{{cite web|title=Medieval St. Albans|url=http://www.salbani.co.uk/Med%20Web/holywell_hill.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of St Albans}}\n\n===Celtic===\nThere was an [[Iron Age]] settlement known as Verulamium,<ref name=niblett>Rosalind Niblett, ''Roman Hertfordshire'', Wimborne: Dovecote Press, 1995</ref> [[Verlamion]], or Verlamio, near the site of the present city, the centre of [[Tasciovanus]]' power and a major centre of the [[Catuvellauni]] from about 20 BC until shortly after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of AD 43.<ref>John Wacher, 1976, ''The Towns of Roman Britain'', p. 202, both for Tasciovanus and the Catuvellauni.</ref> The name \"Verulamium\" is Celtic, meaning \"settlement over or by the marsh\".<ref name=niblett/> The town was on Prae Hill, 2&nbsp;km to the west of modern St Albans, now covered by the village of St Michael's, Verulamium Park and the [[Gorhambury]] Estate.<ref name=niblett/> Although excavations done in 1996 produced finds which included silver coins from the Roman Republican era dating from 90/80 bc evidence of trade with the republic and that a settlement already existed on the site 50 years before Julius Caesar attempted to invade Britain, yet it is believed that the tribal capital was moved to the site by Tasciovanus (around 25 to 5&nbsp;BC).

It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of [[Boudica]] of the [[Iceni]] in 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt on her orders:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boudicca.shtml|title=BBC - History - Boudicca|publisher=}}</ref>excavations preceding the museum's new entrance done in 1996-7  within the centre of the Roman town gave archaeologists the chance to date a black ash layer to 60-65 AD, thus confirming the Roman written record. It grew steadily; by the early 3rd century, it covered an area of about {{convert|125|acre|km2}}, behind a deep ditch and wall. Verulamium contained a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], [[basilica]] and a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], much of which were damaged during two fires, one in 155 and the other in around 250. These were repaired and continued in use in the 4th century. The theatre was disused by the end of the 4th century. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain is found on the remnants of the forum (see [[Verulamium Forum inscription]]). The town was rebuilt in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] rather than [[timber]] at least twice over the next 150 years. Roman occupation ended between 400 and 450 AD\n\nThe body of St Alban was probably buried outside the city walls in a Roman cemetery near the present [[St Albans Cathedral|cathedral]]. His hillside grave became a place of pilgrimage. Recent investigation has uncovered a [[basilica]] there, indicating the oldest continuous site of Christian worship in Great Britain.

Victorian St Albans was small and had little industry. Its population grew more slowly than London, 8\u20139% per decade between 1801 and 1861, compared to the 31% per decade growth of London in the same period. The railway arrived relatively late, in 1858. In 1869 the extension of the city boundaries was opposed by the Earl of Verulam and many of the townsfolk, but there was rapid expansion and much building at the end of the century, and between 1891 and 1901 the population grew by 37%.<ref name=briggs>Asa Briggs, \"The Victorian City\", in \u2018\u2019Cathedral & City: St Albans Ancient and Modern\u2019\u2019, ed.

The new [[Diocese of St Albans|diocese]] was established in the same year, in the main from parts of the large [[Diocese of Rochester]].\n\nIn the inter-war years it became a centre for the [[electronics]] industry.

In 1887 the borough gained [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], following the elevation of St Albans Abbey to cathedral, and the boundary was adjusted to include part of the parish of [[Sandridge]].\n\nThe Local Government Act 1894 divided parishes that were partly within municipal boroughs. The parts of St Michael, St Peter and Sandridge within the borough became the new parishes of St Michael Urban, St Peter Urban and Sandridge Urban. The part of St Stephen within the borough was absorbed by the parish of St Albans. The parishes that were formed outside the borough, that is St Michael Rural, St Peter Rural, Sandridge Rural and the reduced St Stephen, became part of [[St Albans Rural District]] in 1894.\n\nIn 1898 the parish of St Albans absorbed St Michael Urban, St Peter Urban and Sandridge Urban so the parish and borough occupied the same area. In 1901 the population of the borough was 16,019, growing to 18,133 in 1911. St Albans expanded in 1913 by gaining parts of Sandridge Rural (241 acres), St Michael Rural (138 acres), St Peter Rural (992 acres) and St Stephen (335 acres). In 1921 the population of the enlarged borough was 25,593, growing to 28,624 in 1931. It expanded again in 1935 as part of a [[county review order]] gaining more of St Michael Rural (890 acres), St Peter Rural (436 acres) and St Stephen (712 acres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10213381/relationships |title=St Albans AP/CP through time &#124; Census tables with data for the Parish-level Unit |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref> The population of the borough was 44,098 in 1951 and 50,293 in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10213381/cube/TOT_POP |title=St Albans AP/CP through time &#124; Population Statistics &#124; Total Population |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Present====\n[[File:StAlbans-PSX1.JPG|thumb|St Albans viewed from the [[Clock Tower, St Albans|Clock Tower]]: French Row (to the left), Market Place (to the right), St Peter's Street and the tower of St Peter's Church (centre)]]\n{{Main|City and District of St Albans}}\nThe borough was abolished on 1 April 1974 and St Albans became part of the new, larger [[City and District of St Albans]].

It is located approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} from [[Kings Cross, London]]. Welwyn Garden City was the second [[Garden city movement|garden city]] in England (founded 1920) and one of the first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] (designated 1948).\n\nIt is unique in being both a garden city and a new town and exemplifies the physical, social and cultural planning ideals of the periods in which it was built.\n\n== History ==\nWelwyn Garden City was founded by Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]] in 1920 following his previous experiment in [[Letchworth Garden City]]. Howard had called for the creation of planned towns that were to combine the benefits of the city and the countryside and to avoid the disadvantages of both. The [[Town and Country Planning Association|Garden Cities and Town Planning Association]] had defined a garden city as\n\n<blockquote>\"a town designed for healthy living and industry of a size that makes possible a full measure of social life but not larger, surrounded by a rural belt; the whole of the land being in public ownership, or held in trust for the community\"<ref name=soissons /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1919, Howard arranged for the purchase of land in Hertfordshire that had already been identified as a suitable site. On 29 April 1920 a company, Welwyn Garden City Limited, was formed to plan and build the garden city, chaired by Sir Theodore Chambers. [[Louis de Soissons]] was appointed as architect and town planner, C.B Purdom as finance director and [[Frederic Osborn]] as secretary.<ref name=soissons /><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vlBPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Frederic+Osborn%22+welwyn&q=secretary+welwyn | title=F.J.O. - Practical Idealist: A Biography of Sir Frederic Osborn | publisher=Town and Country Planning | date=1987 | last=Osborn | first=Sir Frederick James | last2=Whittick | first2=Arnold | pages=32, 34 | language=en | isbn=978-0-902797-15-4}}</ref> The first house was occupied just before Christmas 1920.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cashewnut.me.uk/WGCbooks/web-WGC-books-1925-1.php | title=WGC-1925-1 Satellite Towns (Purdom) | website=cashewnut.me.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cmglee Welwyn Garden City memorial garden.jpg|thumb|left|View along the Parkway to the south from the memorial garden to Louis de Soissons in May 2017]]\nThe town is laid out along tree-lined boulevards with a [[Georgian architecture|neo-Georgian]] town centre.<ref name=\"herts\">{{cite web | access-date=24 September 2009 | archive-date=17 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817221545/http://www.hertfordshire.com/pages/towns/guides/642/ | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all | url=http://www.hertfordshire.com/pages/towns/guides/642/ | title=Hertfordshire.com}}</ref> It has its own environmental protection legislation, the Scheme of Management for Welwyn Garden City.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.welhat.gov.uk/planning/developmentcontrol_2/estatemanagementscheme | title=Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930124924/http://www.welhat.gov.uk/planning/developmentcontrol_2/estatemanagementscheme | archivedate=30 September 2009 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Every road has a wide grass verge.

Louis de Soissons remained as its planning consultant.  That year ''[[The Times]]'' compared Welwyn Garden City with Hatfield.  It described Welwyn Garden City as a world-famous modern new town developed as an experiment in community planning and Hatfield as an unplanned settlement created by sporadic building in the open country.  \"Welwyn, though far from perfect, made the New Towns Act possible, just as Hatfield, by its imperfection, made it necessary.\"<ref>''The Times'', Saturday, 3 January 1948, p. 5</ref> In 1966, the Development Corporation was wound up and handed over to the [[Commission for New Towns]].

A new hospital, completed in June 2015, offers outpatient, diagnostic and ante/postnatal services.\n\nA shopping mall, the [[Howard Centre]], was built in the 1980s, incorporating a replacement for the original \"temporary\" [[Welwyn Garden City railway station|railway station]].\n\nThere is a resurgence of interest in the ethos of the garden city and the type of neighbourhood and community advocated by Howard, prompted by the problems of metropolitan and regional development and the importance of [[sustainability]] in government policy.<ref>David Schuyler, ''From Garden City to Green City: The Legacy of Ebenezer Howard'', Johns Hopkins, 2002</ref>\n\nOn the outskirts of Old Welwyn village Roman baths are preserved in a steel vault underneath junction 6 of the A1(M) and are open to visitors.<ref name=herts />\n\nThe local civic society, which aims to preserve and conserve the garden city ethos, is the Welwyn Garden City Society.\n\nThe international ecumenical [[Focolare]] movement has its British headquarters at Welwyn Garden City.\n\nIn 2008, during construction of a site for [[HSBC]], 60 unsecured argonite fire suppressant cylinders discharged, killing one person, injuring six others and causing substantial damage.

The 301 additionally connects both the nearby hospitals in Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City, while the 300 provides a direct link to recreational areas such as [[Stanborough park|Stanborough Lakes]] in Welwyn Garden City and [[Verulamium]] Roman town in St Albans. Service 314 is provided by Centrebus, connecting Welwyn to [[Codicote]] and [[Hitchin]]. The bus station is close to the railway station.\n\nUno buses serve the nearby towns of Hatfield, St Albans, [[Potters Bar]], Hemel Hempstead, [[Watford]] and [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]].

It is located approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} from [[Kings Cross, London]]. Welwyn Garden City was the second [[Garden city movement|garden city]] in England (founded 1920) and one of the first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] (designated 1948).\n\nIt is unique in being both a garden city and a new town and exemplifies the physical, social and cultural planning ideals of the periods in which it was built.\n\n== History ==\nWelwyn Garden City was founded by Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]] in 1920 following his previous experiment in [[Letchworth Garden City]]. Howard had called for the creation of planned towns that were to combine the benefits of the city and the countryside and to avoid the disadvantages of both. The [[Town and Country Planning Association|Garden Cities and Town Planning Association]] had defined a garden city as\n\n<blockquote>\"a town designed for healthy living and industry of a size that makes possible a full measure of social life but not larger, surrounded by a rural belt; the whole of the land being in public ownership, or held in trust for the community\"<ref name=soissons /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1919, Howard arranged for the purchase of land in Hertfordshire that had already been identified as a suitable site. On 29 April 1920 a company, Welwyn Garden City Limited, was formed to plan and build the garden city, chaired by Sir Theodore Chambers. [[Louis de Soissons]] was appointed as architect and town planner, C.B Purdom as finance director and [[Frederic Osborn]] as secretary.<ref name=soissons /><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vlBPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Frederic+Osborn%22+welwyn&q=secretary+welwyn | title=F.J.O. - Practical Idealist: A Biography of Sir Frederic Osborn | publisher=Town and Country Planning | date=1987 | last=Osborn | first=Sir Frederick James | last2=Whittick | first2=Arnold | pages=32, 34 | language=en | isbn=978-0-902797-15-4}}</ref> The first house was occupied just before Christmas 1920.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cashewnut.me.uk/WGCbooks/web-WGC-books-1925-1.php | title=WGC-1925-1 Satellite Towns (Purdom) | website=cashewnut.me.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cmglee Welwyn Garden City memorial garden.jpg|thumb|left|View along the Parkway to the south from the memorial garden to Louis de Soissons in May 2017]]\nThe town is laid out along tree-lined boulevards with a [[Georgian architecture|neo-Georgian]] town centre.<ref name=\"herts\">{{cite web | access-date=24 September 2009 | archive-date=17 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817221545/http://www.hertfordshire.com/pages/towns/guides/642/ | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all | url=http://www.hertfordshire.com/pages/towns/guides/642/ | title=Hertfordshire.com}}</ref> It has its own environmental protection legislation, the Scheme of Management for Welwyn Garden City.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.welhat.gov.uk/planning/developmentcontrol_2/estatemanagementscheme | title=Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930124924/http://www.welhat.gov.uk/planning/developmentcontrol_2/estatemanagementscheme | archivedate=30 September 2009 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Every road has a wide grass verge.

Louis de Soissons remained as its planning consultant.  That year ''[[The Times]]'' compared Welwyn Garden City with Hatfield.  It described Welwyn Garden City as a world-famous modern new town developed as an experiment in community planning and Hatfield as an unplanned settlement created by sporadic building in the open country.  \"Welwyn, though far from perfect, made the New Towns Act possible, just as Hatfield, by its imperfection, made it necessary.\"<ref>''The Times'', Saturday, 3 January 1948, p. 5</ref> In 1966, the Development Corporation was wound up and handed over to the [[Commission for New Towns]].

A new hospital, completed in June 2015, offers outpatient, diagnostic and ante/postnatal services.\n\nA shopping mall, the [[Howard Centre]], was built in the 1980s, incorporating a replacement for the original \"temporary\" [[Welwyn Garden City railway station|railway station]].\n\nThere is a resurgence of interest in the ethos of the garden city and the type of neighbourhood and community advocated by Howard, prompted by the problems of metropolitan and regional development and the importance of [[sustainability]] in government policy.<ref>David Schuyler, ''From Garden City to Green City: The Legacy of Ebenezer Howard'', Johns Hopkins, 2002</ref>\n\nOn the outskirts of Old Welwyn village Roman baths are preserved in a steel vault underneath junction 6 of the A1(M) and are open to visitors.<ref name=herts />\n\nThe local civic society, which aims to preserve and conserve the garden city ethos, is the Welwyn Garden City Society.\n\nThe international ecumenical [[Focolare]] movement has its British headquarters at Welwyn Garden City.\n\nIn 2008, during construction of a site for [[HSBC]], 60 unsecured argonite fire suppressant cylinders discharged, killing one person, injuring six others and causing substantial damage.

He is best known for his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), where he played as both a [[shooting guard]] and [[small forward]]. McGrady is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star]], seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection, two-time [[NBA annual scoring champion|NBA scoring champion]], and one-time winner of the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]]. He was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2017.\n\nMcGrady [[NBA high school draftees|entered the NBA straight out of high school]] and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin [[Vince Carter]]. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the [[Orlando Magic]], where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 2004, he was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he paired with center [[Yao Ming]] to help the Rockets become a perennial [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the [[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nSince retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for [[ESPN]]. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional [[baseball]], [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitching]] for the [[Sugar Land Skeeters]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in [[Bartow, Florida]], to Melanise Williford.<ref name=Reference /> His father was not a part of his everyday life, so Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|title=Tracy McGrady Biography|url=https://www.jockbio.com/Bios/McGrady/McGrady_bio.html|publisher=JockBio|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref> As a youth, McGrady played [[high school basketball]] and [[baseball]] at [[Auburndale High School]] for three years before transferring to [[Mt.

American former professional [[basketball]] player. He is best known for his career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), where he played as both a [[shooting guard]] and [[small forward]]. McGrady is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star]], seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection, two-time [[NBA annual scoring champion|NBA scoring champion]], and one-time winner of the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]]. He was also inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2017.\n\nMcGrady [[NBA high school draftees|entered the NBA straight out of high school]] and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin [[Vince Carter]]. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the [[Orlando Magic]], where he became one of the league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 2004, he was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], where he paired with center [[Yao Ming]] to help the Rockets become a perennial [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the [[Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nSince retiring, McGrady has worked as a basketball analyst for [[ESPN]]. From April to July 2014, he realized his dream of playing professional [[baseball]], [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitching]] for the [[Sugar Land Skeeters]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMcGrady was born on May 24, 1979, in [[Bartow, Florida]], to Melanise Williford.<ref name=Reference /> His father was not a part of his everyday life, so Melanise raised McGrady with the help of her mother, Roberta, in [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|title=Tracy McGrady Biography|url=https://www.jockbio.com/Bios/McGrady/McGrady_bio.html|publisher=JockBio|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref> As a youth, McGrady played [[high school basketball]] and [[baseball]] at [[Auburndale High School]] for three years before transferring to [[Mt.
