{"title_page": "Coastal erosion in Louisiana", "text_new": "{{see also|Coastal erosion}}\n\n{{Merge from|South Louisiana coastal erosion|discuss=Talk:Coastal erosion in Louisiana#Proposed merge with South Louisiana coastal erosion|date=December 2019}}\n'''Coastal Erosion in Louisiana''' is the process of steady depletion of [[Wetlands of Louisiana|wetlands]] along the state's coastline in [[marshes]], [[swamp]]s, and [[barrier island]]s, particularly affecting the [[Alluvial plain|alluvial]] basin surrounding the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] at the foot of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on the Eastern half of the state's coast.  In the last century, Southeast [[Louisiana]] has lost a large portion of its wetlands and is expected to lose more in the coming years, with some estimates claiming [[land loss|wetland losses]] equivalent to up to 1 football field per hour.  One consequence of coastal erosion is an increased vulnerability to hurricane [[storm surge]]s, which affects the [[New Orleans]] metropolitan area and other communities in the region.  The state has outlined a comprehensive master plan for coastal restoration and has begun to implement various restoration projects such as fresh water diversions, but certain zones will have to be prioritized and targeted for restoration efforts, as it is unlikely that all depleted wetlands can be rehabilitated.  \n  \nThe process of coastal erosion is the result of various factors, particularly the blockage of traditionally occurring deposits of fresh water and silt from the river caused by man-made levees which have been built up and down most of the river over the last century, which now impede the river's ability to replenish its southernmost alluvial plains which are constantly dependent on the infusion of the river's once plentiful deposits which usually occurred during annual high stage floods in the springtime, the kind of which the river-levees now serve to buffer against for the protection of residents, livestock, and property residing in regions adjacent to the river throughout the Mississippi River valley.  The deterioration results in the death of fresh and brackish water plants historically part of the ecosystem, which are not only a vital feature of the wetlands' topography, but also serve to capture silt, and thus are needed to build up and sustain marsh structures.  As fresh and brackish water plant habitats recede, salt water from the Gulf of Mexico further encroaches, killing off more non-saltwater plants, thus further eroding pre-existing mud formations that these plants had once supported.\n\nOther factors exacerbating coastal erosion in Southeast Louisiana include the presence of canals and navigational routes dug through marshes and swamps, often to accommodate logistical needs of the [[petrochemical industry]], as well as the previous practice of logging, all of which have allowed the incursion of saltwater (saline) from the Gulf into previously fresh and brackish water plant habitats.

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea levels attributed to global warming have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day.\n\nAn extensive [[levee]] system aided by locks and dams has been developed in the waterways of the lower Mississippi River.<ref>Reuss, M. (1998). Designing the Bayous: The Control of Water in the Atchafalaya Basin 1800\u20131995. Alexandria, VA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Office of History.</ref>  The levees, designed to prevent flooding along the waterways, on one hand, prevent silt from draining into the river yet also from being distributed into the marshes downriver.  With no new accretion and with steady subsidence, the wetlands slowly are replaced by encroaching saltwater form the Gulf.  As a result of this apparent dilemma, large areas of marsh are being lost to the ocean. Since 1930 water has consumed more than 1,900 square miles (4,900&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the state's land.  This loss equates to the disappearance of 25 square miles (65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of wetlands each year or a football-field-sized area every 30 minutes. This loss can be reversed, at least in some areas, but only with large scale restoration, including the removal of levees to allow the Mississippi River to carry silt into these areas.<ref name=\"Keddy, P.A. 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Keddy | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = D. | last3 = McFalls | first3 = T. | last4 = Shaffer | first4 = G. | last5 = Moreau | first5 = R. | last6 = Dranguet | first6 = C. | last7 = Heleniak | first7 = R. | year = 2007 | title = The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future | url = | journal = Environmental Reviews | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 1\u201335 | doi = 10.1139/a06-008 }}</ref><ref>Turner, R.

After the levees were built, however, flood sediment flowed directly into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This subsidence along with the recent [[sea level rise]] tipped the balance toward subsidence rather than marsh growth. This, along with the [[canal]]s built in the area, caused decline of the wetlands and also caused less weakening of and less protection from recent hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=\"Katrina\" /> The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation has developed a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150906003910/http://www.saveourlake.org/management-plan.php comprehensive management plan] for the eastern regions of the Louisiana coast, placing emphasis upon restoration of riverine habitats, cypress swamps and fringing marsh. This could be a model applied to other coastal regions.\n\nSubsidence may be due to other factors as well. Some observers blame the direct effects of oil and gas extraction.  They contend that, as billions of barrels of oil and saltwater and as trillions of cubic feet of gas were removed from the subterranean structures in which they had accumulated over millions of years, these structures lost their ability to support the weight of the earth above.  As these structures slowly collapsed, the soil above gradually subsided. The wetlands on the surface began to sink into the gulf waters. Others argue that subsidence is a natural process in deltas, as sediments compress, and that the real problem is the lack of flood waters that would normally deposit new layers of sediment.<ref name=\"Boesch, D.

[[Fishing industry|Commercial fishing]] in Louisiana accounts for more than 300 million dollars of the state's economy.  More than 70% of that amount stems from species such as [[shrimp]], [[oyster]]s and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]] that count on the coastal wetlands as a nursery for their young.  Annually Louisiana sells more than 330,000 hunting licenses and 900,000 fishing licenses to men and women who depend on the wetlands as a habitat for their game.  Additional recreational activities such as boating, swimming, camping, hiking, birding, photography and painting are abundant in wetland areas. Wetlands host a variety of trees such as the [[bald cypress]], [[tupelo]] gum and [[Populus heterophylla|cottonwood]].  Other plants such as the [[dwarf palmetto]] and [[wax myrtle]] and submerged aquatic plants such as ''[[Vallisneria]]'' and ''[[Ruppia]]'' are native to Louisiana wetlands. Wetland plants act as natural filters, helping to remove heavy metals, sewage, and pesticides from polluted water before reaching the Gulf of Mexico.  Animal species native to these areas include [[osprey]], [[anhinga]], [[ibis]], [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[alligator]]s, and [[beaver]]s. Although there are several naturally occurring forces that adversely affect the wetland regions of Louisiana, many believe it is human intervention that has caused the majority of the decline.<ref name=\"Katrina\">Tidwell, Mike.

The sandbars off of Louisiana's coast protect Louisiana's coast from storm surges and high speed winds that come with hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico. In the past, these sandbars have helped minimize the damage to Louisiana's coast from hurricanes. However, as costal erosion continues to cause these sandbars to degrade, the damage taken by Louisiana's coastline continues to increase.\n\nBecause of this loss of Louisiana's coastline, many Louisiana communities are being effected. Some communities are experiencing flooding on a much more regular basis. If this loss of coastline continues, many of these communities will have to relocate. Some communities already have completely located, uprooting everyone who lives there. Therefore, coastal erosion is having a much greater effect on Louisiana residents then many people believe. \n\n==Proposed and attempted solutions==\n\nThere are several projects and proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, some of which have been attempted, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The roots of plants help hold soil in place and stop the soil from eroding. By adding more vegetation to the wetlands, we can make to soil more firm and less likely to erode. However, salt water intrusion is killing lots of these plants, so keeping the plants from dying can help impede the process of coastal and wetland erosion.\n\nAnother way to combat coastal erosion is to create seawalls and breakwaters. Seawalls are manmade barriers that are erected to keep seawater from reaching the coast. Because the seawater is unable to reach the coast, the water is unable to erode the coastline, thus preventing coastal erosion. Breakwaters function much like seawalls, except that they are not manmade, they are made from large formations of rocks stacked near each other. They are not as effective as seawalls in stopping water from reaching the coast, however, they allow seawater to bring sediment within its barrier, but stop the retreating water from removing sediment, thus helping coastlines build up and replenish. \n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Mississippi River Delta]]\n*[[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]\n*[[Wetlands]]\n*[[Chemistry of wetland dredging]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Coastal erosion in the United States]]\n[[Category:Environment of Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Environmental issues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Geography of Louisiana]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Coastal erosion}}\n\n{{Merge from|South Louisiana coastal erosion|discuss=Talk:Coastal erosion in Louisiana#Proposed merge with South Louisiana coastal erosion|date=December 2019}}\n'''Coastal Erosion in Louisiana''' is the process of steady depletion of [[Wetlands of Louisiana|wetlands]] along the state's coastline in [[marshes]], [[swamp]]s, and [[barrier island]]s, particularly affecting the [[Alluvial plain|alluvial]] basin surrounding the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] at the foot of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on the Eastern half of the state's coast.  In the last century, Southeast [[Louisiana]] has lost a large portion of its wetlands and is expected to lose more in the coming years, with some estimates claiming [[land loss|wetland losses]] equivalent to up to 1 football field per hour.  One consequence of coastal erosion is an increased vulnerability to hurricane [[storm surge]]s, which affects the [[New Orleans]] metropolitan area and other communities in the region.  The state has outlined a comprehensive master plan for coastal restoration and has begun to implement various restoration projects such as fresh water diversions, but certain zones will have to be prioritized and targeted for restoration efforts, as it is unlikely that all depleted wetlands can be rehabilitated.  \n  \nThe process of coastal erosion is the result of various factors, particularly the blockage of traditionally occurring deposits of fresh water and silt from the river caused by man-made levees which have been built up and down most of the river over the last century, which now impede the river's ability to replenish its southernmost alluvial plains which are constantly dependent on the infusion of the river's once plentiful deposits which usually occurred during annual high stage floods in the springtime, the kind of which the river-levees now serve to buffer against for the protection of residents, livestock, and property residing in regions adjacent to the river throughout the Mississippi River valley.  The deterioration results in the death of fresh and brackish water plants historically part of the ecosystem, which are not only a vital feature of the wetlands' topography, but also serve to capture silt, and thus are needed to build up and sustain marsh structures.  As fresh and brackish water plant habitats recede, salt water from the Gulf of Mexico further encroaches, killing off more non-saltwater plants, thus further eroding pre-existing mud formations which these plants had once supported.\n\nOther factors exacerbating coastal erosion in Southeast Louisiana include the presence of canals and navigational routes dug though marshes and swamps, often to accommodate logistical needs of the [[petrochemical industry]], as well as the previous practice of logging, all of which have allowed the incursion of saltwater (saline) from the Gulf into previously fresh and brackish water plant habitats.

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea levels attributed to global warming have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day.\n\nAn extensive [[levee]] system aided by locks and dams has been developed in the waterways of the lower Mississippi River.<ref>Reuss, M. (1998). Designing the Bayous: The Control of Water in the Atchafalaya Basin 1800\u20131995. Alexandria, VA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Office of History.</ref>  The levees, designed to prevent flooding along the waterways, on one hand, prevent silt from draining into the river yet also from being distributed into the marshes downriver.  With no new accretion and with steady subsidence, the wetlands slowly are replaced by encroaching saltwater form the Gulf.  As a result of this apparent dilemma, large areas of marsh are being lost to the ocean. Since 1930 water has consumed more than 1,900 square miles (4,900&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the state's land.  This loss equates to the disappearance of 25 square miles (65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of wetlands each year or a football field sized area every 30 minutes. This loss can be reversed, at least in some areas, but only with large scale restoration, including the removal of levees to allow the Mississippi River to carry silt into these areas.<ref name=\"Keddy, P.A. 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Keddy | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = D. | last3 = McFalls | first3 = T. | last4 = Shaffer | first4 = G. | last5 = Moreau | first5 = R. | last6 = Dranguet | first6 = C. | last7 = Heleniak | first7 = R. | year = 2007 | title = The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future | url = | journal = Environmental Reviews | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 1\u201335 | doi = 10.1139/a06-008 }}</ref><ref>Turner, R.

After the levees were built, however, flood sediment flowed directly into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This subsidence along with the recent [[sea level rise]] tipped the balance toward subsidence rather than marsh growth. This, along with the [[canal]]s built in the area, caused decline of the wetlands and also caused less weakening of and less protection from recent hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=\"Katrina\" /> The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation has developed a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150906003910/http://www.saveourlake.org/management-plan.php comprehensive management plan] for the eastern regions of the Louisiana coast, placing emphasis upon restoration of riverine habitats, cypress swamps and fringing marsh. This could be a model applied to other coastal regions.\n\nSubsidence may be due to other factors as well. Some observers blame the direct effects of oil and gas extraction.  They contend that, as billions of barrels of oil and saltwater and as trillions of cubic feet of gas were removed from the subterranean structures in which they had accumulated over millions of years, these structures lost their ability to support the weight of the earth above.  As these structures slowly collapsed, the soil above gradually subsided. The wetlands on the surface began to sink into the gulf waters. Others argue that subsidence is a natural process in deltas, as sediments compress, and that the real problem is the lack of flood waters that would normally deposit new layers of sediment.<ref name=\"Boesch, D.

In the past, these sandbars have helped minimize the damage to Louisiana's coast from hurricanes. However, as costal erosion continues to cause these sandbars to degrade, the damage taken by Louisiana's coastline continue to increase.\n\nBecause of this loss of Louisiana's coastline, many Louisiana communities are being effected. Some communities are experiencing flooding on a much more regular basis. If this loss of coastline continues, many of these communities will have to relocate. Some communities already have completely located, uprooting everyone who lives there. Therefore, coastal erosion is having a much greater effect on Louisiana residents then many people believe. \n\n==Proposed and attempted solutions==\n\nThere are several projects and proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, some of which have been attempted, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

restoration.<ref name=\"Times-Picayune (Revenue)\"/>\n\nOne way to combat coastal erosion is to try and plant more vegetation in Louisiana's wetlands. The roots of plants help hold soil in place and stop the soil from eroding. By adding more vegetation to the wetlands, we can make to soil more firm and less likely to erode. However, salt water intrusion is killing lots of these plants, so keeping the plants from dying can help impede the process of coastal and wetland erosion.\n\nAnother way to combat coastal erosion is to create seawalls and breakwaters. Seawalls are manmade barriers that are erected to keep seawater from reaching the coast. Because the seawater is unable to reach the coast, the water is unable to erode the coastline, thus preventing coastal erosion. Breakwaters function much like seawalls, except that they are not manmade, they are made from large formations of rocks stacked near each other. They are not as effective as seawalls in stopping water from reaching the coast, however, they allow seawater to bring sediment within its barrier, but stop the retreating water from removing sediment, thus helping coastlines build up and replenish. \n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Mississippi River Delta]]\n*[[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]\n*[[Wetlands]]\n*[[Chemistry of wetland dredging]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Coastal erosion in the United States]]\n[[Category:Environment of Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Environmental issues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Geography of Louisiana]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; typos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion_in_Louisiana"}

Populations identified as \"Pelasgian\" spoke a language or languages that at the time Greeks identified as \"[[barbarians|barbaric]]\", though some ancient writers nonetheless described the Pelasgians as [[Greeks]]. A tradition also survived that large parts of Greece had once been Pelasgian before being [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]. These parts fell largely, though far from exclusively, within the territory which by the 5th century BC was inhabited by those speakers of [[ancient Greek]] who were identified as [[Ionians]] and [[Aeolians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ionian|title=Ionian|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nMuch like all other aspects of the \"Pelasgians\", their ethnonym (''Pelasgoi'') is of extremely uncertain provenance and [[etymology]]. Michel Sakellariou collects fifteen different etymologies proposed for it by philologists and linguists during the last 200&nbsp;years, though he admits that \"most ... are fanciful\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sakellariou|1977|pp=101\u2013104}}.</ref>\n\nAn ancient etymology based on mere similarity of sounds linked ''pelasgos'' to ''pelargos'' (\"[[stork]]\") and postulates that the Pelasgians were migrants like storks, possibly from [[Egypt]], where they nest.<ref>[[Strabo]]. ''Geography'', 5.2.4.</ref> [[Aristophanes]] deals effectively with this etymology in his comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]''. One of the laws of \"the storks\" in the satirical [[cloud-cuckoo-land]], playing upon the Athenian belief that they were originally Pelasgians, is that grown-up storks must support their parents by migrating elsewhere and conducting warfare.<ref>Aristophanes. ''The Birds'', 1355ff.</ref>\n  \n[[Gilbert Murray]] summarizes the derivation from ''pelas g\u0113'' (\"neighboring land\"), current at his time: \"If Pelasgoi is connected with \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2, 'near', the word would mean 'neighbor' and would denote the nearest strange people to the invading Greeks\".<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1960|p=43}}.</ref>\n \n[[Julius Pokorny]] derives Pelasgoi from ''*pelag-skoi'' (\"flatland-inhabitants\"); specifically \"inhabitants of the [[Thessalian plain]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Pokorny|1969|pp=831\u2013832}}.</ref> He details a previous derivation, which appears in English at least as early as [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]'s ''Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstone|1858|loc=Chapter 2, Section 3, \"Derivation of the Pelasgian Name\", pp. 211\u2013215}}.</ref> If the Pelasgians were not Indo-Europeans, the name in this derivation must have been assigned by the Hellenes. [[Ernest Klein]] argued that the ancient Greek word for \"sea\", ''pelagos'' and the Doric word ''plagos'', \"side\" (which is flat) shared the same root, *pl\u0101k-, and that ''*pelag-skoi'' therefore meant \"the sea men\", where the sea is flat.<ref>{{harvnb|Klein|1966|loc=\"Pelasgian and Pelagic\"}}.</ref> This could be connected to the maritime marauders referred to as the [[Sea People]] in Egyptian records. Subsequent scholarship shows that the connection between the two roots is \"phonetically impossible\".<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009|p=1165}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient literary evidence==\n[[File:Pelasgian presence in ancient texts (English).svg|thumb|Map of Pelasgians and Pelasgus.]]\nLiterary analysis has been ongoing since [[classical Greece]], when the writers of those times read previous works on the subject. No definitive answers were ever forthcoming by this method; it rather served to better define the problems. The method perhaps reached a peak in the [[Victorian era]] when new methods of systematic comparison began to be applied in [[philology]]. Typical of the era is the study by [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a trained classicist.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstone|1858}}. The Pelasgians are covered especially in Volume I.</ref> Until further ancient texts come to light, advances on the subject cannot be made. The most likely source of progress regarding the Pelasgians continues to be archaeology and related sciences.\n\n===Poets===\n\n====Homer====\nThe Pelasgians first appear in the poems of [[Homer]]: those who are stated to be Pelasgians in the ''[[Iliad]]'' are among the allies of [[Troy]]. In the section known as the ''[[Catalogue of Trojans]]'', they are mentioned between mentions of the [[Hellespont]]ine cities and the [[Thracians]] of south-eastern Europe (i.e.,&nbsp;on the Hellespontine border of [[Thrace]]).<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 2.840\u20132.843. The camp at [[Troy]] is mentioned in ''Iliad'', 10.428\u201310.429.</ref> Homer calls their town or district \"Larisa\"<ref>Not the same as the [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]], Greece. Many towns bearing the same (or similar) name existed.</ref> and characterises it as fertile, and its inhabitants as celebrated for their spearsmanship. He records their chiefs as [[Hippothous]] and [[Pylaeus]], sons of Lethus son of Teutamus, thus giving all of them names that were Greek or so thoroughly [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] that any foreign element has been effaced.\n\nIn the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus, affecting to be Cretan himself, instances Pelasgians among the tribes in the ninety cities of [[Crete]], \"language mixing with language side by side\".<ref>Homer. ''Odyssey'', 19.175\u201319.177 ([[Robert Fagles]]'s translation).</ref> Last on his list, Homer distinguishes them from other ethnicities on the island: \"Cretans proper\", Achaeans, Cydonians (of the city of Cydonia/modern [[Chania]]), Dorians, and \"noble Pelasgians\".<ref>Homer. ''Odyssey'', Book 19 (T.E. Lawrence's translation).</ref>\n\nThe ''Iliad'' also refers to \"Pelasgic Argos\",<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 2.681\u20132.684.</ref> which is most likely to be the [[plain of Thessaly]],<ref>The location is never explicitly given. Gladstone shows, by process of elimination, that it must be in the north of Thessaly. ({{harvnb|Gladstone|1858|pp=100\u2013105}}.)</ref> and to \"Pelasgic [[Zeus]]\", living in and ruling over [[Dodona]],<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 16.233\u201316.235.</ref> which must be the oracular one in [[Epirus]]. However, neither passage mentions actual Pelasgians; [[Myrmidons]], Hellenes, and Achaeans specifically inhabit Thessaly and the Selloi are around Dodona. They all fought on the Greek side.\n\n[[File:Thessaly Plain.jpg|thumb|250px|Plain of [[Thessaly]], to the west of classical Pelasgiotis, but in the original range of the Pelasgians. The [[Pindus Mountains]] are visible in the background. The river is the [[Pineios River (Thessaly)|Peneus]].]] \n\nAccording to the ''Iliad'', Pelasgians were camping out on the shore together with the following tribes,\n\n<blockquote>Towards the sea lie the [[Carians]] and the [[Paeonians]], with curved bows, and the [[Leleges]] and [[Caucones]], and the goodly Pelasgi.<ref>Homer.

One of the first was [[Hesiod]]; he calls the oracular [[Dodona]], identified by reference to \"the [[oak]]\", the \"seat of Pelasgians\",<ref>Hesiod, fr. 319 M\u2013W = Strabo.

''The Suppliants'', Lines 262\u2013263.</ref> implying that Argos includes all of east Greece from the north of Thessaly to the Peloponnesian Argos, where the Danaids are probably to be conceived as having landed. He claims to rule the Pelasgians and to be the \"child of Palaichthon (or 'ancient earth') whom the earth brought forth\".\n\nThe Danaids call the country the \"Apian hills\" and claim that it understands the ''karbana audan''<ref>Aeschylus. ''The Suppliants'', Lines 128\u2013129.</ref> ([[accusative case]], and in the Dorian dialect), which many translate as \"barbarian speech\" but Karba (where the ''Karbanoi'' live) is in fact a non-Greek word. They claim to descend from ancestors in ancient Argos even though they are of a \"dark race\" (''melanthes&nbsp;... genos'').<ref>Aeschylus. ''The Suppliants'', Lines 154\u2013155.</ref> Pelasgus admits that the land was once called Apia but compares them to the women of [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]] and wants to know how they can be from Argos on which they cite descent from [[Io (mythology)|Io]].<ref>Aeschylus. ''The Suppliants'', Lines 279\u2013281.</ref>\n\nIn a lost play by Aeschylus, ''Danaan Women'', he defines the original homeland of the Pelasgians as the region around [[Mycenae]].<ref name=Strabo5.2.4>Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5B*.html 5.2.4].</ref>\n\n====Sophocles====\n[[Sophocles]] presents Inachus, in a fragment of a missing play entitled ''Inachus'',<ref>{{harvnb|Sophocles|Dindorf|1849|loc=Fragment 256 (p. 352)}}.</ref> as the elder in the lands of Argos, the [[Hera]]n hills and among the Tyrsenoi Pelasgoi, an unusual hyphenated noun construction, \"Tyrsenians-Pelasgians\". Interpretation is open, even though translators typically make a decision, but Tyrsenians may well be the ethnonym ''[[Tyrrhenoi]]''.\n\n====Euripides====\n[[Euripides]] calls the inhabitants of Argos \"Pelasgians\" in his ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]''<ref>Euripides. ''Orestes'', Lines 857 and 933.</ref> and ''[[The Phoenician Women (play)|The Phoenician Women]]''.<ref>Euripides.

''Histories'', 1.57. ({{harvnb|Herodotus|Strassler|2009|loc=p. 32)}}.)</ref>\nThe entire territory later called Greece was first called Pelasgia (Herodotus 1942,2:56). These Pelasgians had lived in Samothrace , the island just north of Troy, before they came to Attice (2:51). In Northwestern Peloponnesus the Ionians \"inhabited the land now called Achaea and were called, according to the Greek account, Aegialean Pelasgi, or Pelasgi of the Sea Shore\"; afterwars they were called Ionians (7:94). \"The Islanders ... were a Pelasgian race, who in later times took the name Ionians. The Aeolians too were anciently called Pelasgians (7:95). Their language was different from Greek. The original Athenians were Pelasgians who spoke the \"barbarous\" Pelasgian language (1:57). Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians on the island of Lemnos opposite Troy once kidnapped Hellenic women of Athens for wives, but the Athenian wives created a crisis by teaching their children \"the language of Attica\" instead of the Pelasgian (6:138). Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians spoke a language unlike that of any of their neighbours (1:57). The Pelasgians antedated the Greeks in what was later called Greece. Herodotus characterized the Hellenic Athenians as \"excessively migratory,\" but stated that \"the Pelasgians or Lacedaemons\" had always been there (1:56). Significantly enough, he identified the Spartans as Pelasgians rather than Greeks. The Hellenic race increased because numerous tribes of barbarians voluntarily entered their ranks (1:58).  \n<blockquote>I am unable to state with certainty what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia in the city of Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.</blockquote>\n\nHerodotus alludes to other districts where Pelasgian peoples lived on under changed names; [[Samothrace]]<ref>Herodotus.

Moreover, I do not think the Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.</blockquote>\n\nHe states that the Pelasgians of Athens were called \"Cranai\"<ref>Herodotus.

A plot of land below the Acropolis was called \"Pelasgian\" and was regarded as cursed, but the Athenians settled there anyway.<ref>Thucydides.

They colonized Crete and extended their rule over Epirus, Thessaly and by implication over wherever else the ancient authors said they were, beginning with Homer. The Peloponnese was called \"Pelasgia\".<ref>Strabo.

''Roman Antiquities'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html 1.17].</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Afterwards some of the Pelasgians who inhabited Thessaly, as it is now called, being obliged to leave their country, settled among the Aborigines and jointly with them made war upon the Sicels. It is possible that the Aborigines received them partly in the hope of gaining their assistance, but I believe it was chiefly on account of their kinship; for the Pelasgians, too, were a Greek nation originally from the Peloponnesus &nbsp;...</blockquote>\n\nHe goes on to add that the nation wandered a great deal. They were originally natives of \"Achaean Argos\" descended from Pelasgus, the son of Zeus and Niobe. They migrated from there to Haemonia (later called Thessaly), where they \"drove out the barbarian inhabitants\" and divided the country into Phthiotis, Achaia, and Pelasgiotis, named after Achaeus, Phthius and Pelasgus, \"the sons of Larissa and Poseidon.\" Subsequently, \"about the sixth generation they were driven out by the [[Curetes (tribe)|Curetes]] and [[Leleges]], who are now called [[Aetolia]]ns and [[Locris|Locrians]]\".\n\nFrom there, the Pelasgians dispersed to [[Crete]], the [[Cyclades]], Histaeotis, [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], [[Euboea]], the coast along the [[Hellespont]] and the islands, especially [[Lesbos]], which had been colonized by [[Macar]] son of [[Crinacus]]. Most went to [[Dodona]] and eventually being driven from there to [[Italy]] then called Saturnia. They landed at [[Spina]] at the mouth of the [[Po River]]. Still others crossed the [[Apennine Mountains]] to [[Umbria]] and being driven from there went to the country of the Aborigines. These consented to a treaty and settled them at [[Velia]]. They and the Aborigenes took over Umbria but were dispossessed by the [[Tyrrhenians]]. The author continues to detail the tribulations of the Pelasgians and then goes on to the Tyrrhenians, whom he is careful to distinguish from the Pelasgians.\n\n===Geographers===\n====Pausanias====\nIn his ''[[Description of Greece]]'', [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]] who state that [[Pelasgus]] (along with his followers) was the first inhabitant of their land.<ref>Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias8A.html 8.1.4].</ref> Upon becoming king, Pelasgus was responsible for inventing [[huts]], sheep-skin coats, and a diet consisting of [[acorn]]s.

''Description of Greece'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias7A.html 7.2.2].</ref>\n\n====Strabo====\n[[Strabo]] dedicates a section of his ''Geography'' to the Pelasgians, relating both his own opinions and those of prior writers. Of his own opinions he says:<ref name=Strabo5.2.4/>\n\n<blockquote>As for the Pelasgi, almost all agree, in the first place, that some ancient tribe of that name spread throughout the whole of Greece, and particularly among the Aeolians of Thessaly.</blockquote>\n\nHe defines Pelasgian Argos as being \"between the outlets of the [[Peneus]] River and [[Thermopylae]] as far as the mountainous country of [[Pindus]]\" and states that it took its name from Pelasgian rule. He includes also the tribes of [[Epirus]] as Pelasgians (based on the opinions of \"many\"). [[Lesbos]] is named Pelasgian. [[Caere]] was settled by Pelasgians from Thessaly, who called it by its former name, \"Agylla\". Pelasgians also settled around the mouth of the [[Tiber River]] in [[Italy]] at [[Pyrgi]] and a few other settlements under a king, Maleos.<ref>Strabo. ''Geography'', 5.2.8.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n\nIn the absence of certain knowledge about the identity (or identities) of the Pelasgians, various theories have been proposed. Some of the more prevalent theories supported by scholarship are presented below. Since Greek is classified as an [[Indo-European language]], the major question of concern is whether Pelasgian was an Indo-European language.\n\nGarcia-Ramon (2004) remarked that \"the attempt to determine phonological rules for an Indo-European pre-Greek language ('Pelasgian') ... is considered a complete failure today\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Greece, Languages|author=Garc\u00eda-Ram\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds|editor=Hubert Cancik and Helmut Schneider|title=Brill's New Pauly, vol. 5|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|pages=999-1000}}</ref>, while Beekes (2018) agrees, noting that \"one of the demerits of Georgiev's Pelasgian theory was that it drew attention away from the Pre-Greek material itself\", concluding that \"the search for Pelasgian was an expensive and useless distraction\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Beekes |authorlink1=Robert S.

Before they heard the names of the gods, the Pelasgians (assuming, interestingly, the existence of a number of gods) called them simply \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03af, on the grounds that they had 'established (\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) all affairs in their order'. This etymology, advanced apparently in all seriousness, seems to suggest that the Pelasgians spoke a language at least 'akin to' Greek.\"}}</ref>\n\n====Anatolian====\nIn western Anatolia, many [[toponym]]s with the \"-ss-\" [[infix]] derive from the adjectival [[suffix]] also seen in [[cuneiform]] [[Luwian language|Luwian]] and some [[Palaic language|Palaic]]; the classic example is [[Bronze Age]] [[Tarhuntassa]] (loosely, \"City of the Storm God Tarhunta\"), and later [[Parnassus]] may be related to the Hittite word ''parna-'' or \"house\".

All of these discoveries showed significant resemblances to the Neolithic discoveries made on the Thessalian acropolises of [[Sesklo]] and [[Dimini]]. These discoveries help provide physical confirmation of the literary tradition that describes the Athenians as the descendants of the Pelasgians, who appear to descend continuously from the Neolithic inhabitants in Thessaly.

A short account of their excavations appeared in the ''Messager d'Ath\u00e9nes'' for 3 January 1927. The overall purpose of the excavations was to shed light on the island's \"Etrusco-Pelasgian\" civilization. The excavations were conducted on the site of the city of Hephaisteia (i.e.,&nbsp;Palaiopolis) where the Pelasgians, according to Herodotus, surrendered to [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] of Athens. There, a necropolis (c.&nbsp;9th-8th centuries BC) was discovered revealing bronze objects, pots, and more than 130 [[ossuaries]]. The ossuaries contained distinctly male and female funeral ornaments. Male ossuaries contained knives and axes whereas female ossuaries contained earrings, bronze pins, necklaces, gold [[diadem]]s, and bracelets. The decorations on some of the gold objects contained spirals of Mycenean origin, but had no Geometric forms. According to their ornamentation, the pots discovered at the site were from the Geometric period. However, the pots also preserved spirals indicative of Mycenean art. The results of the excavations indicate that the Early Iron Age inhabitants of Lemnos could be a remnant of a Mycenaean population and, in addition, the earliest attested reference to Lemnos is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''ra-mi-ni-ja'', \"Lemnian woman\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16906], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heffner|1927|pp=123\u2013124}}.</ref>{{r|group=Note|b}}\n\n===Boeotia===\nDuring the 1980s, the Skourta Plain Project identified Middle Helladic and Late Helladic sites on mountain summits near the plains of [[Skourta]] in [[Boeotia]].

Indeed the neolithic vases of Attica date from the earliest neolithic age (5520\u20134900) like the ceramics from the Thessalian acropolis of Sesclos, as well as from the later neolithic age (4900\u20133200) like those from the other Thessalian acropolis of Dimini...The search for traces of the neolithic age on the Acropolis began in 1922 with the excavations of the Italian Archaeological School near the Aesclepium. Another settlement was discovered in the vicinity of the Odeion of Pericles where many sherds of pottery and a stone axe, both of [[Sesklo]] type, were unearthed. Excavations carried out by the American Classical School near the Clepshydra uncovered twenty-one wells and countless pieces of handmade pottery, sherds of [[Dimini]] type, implements of later Stone Age and bones of domestic animals and fish.

That it did not belong to a Greek population, but to a population which, in the eyes of the Hellenes, appeared barbarous, is shown by the weapons. The Greek weapon, dagger or spear, is lacking: the weapons of the barbarians, the axe and the knife, are common. Since, however, this population...preserves so many elements of Mycenaean art, the Tyrrhenians or Pelasgians of Lemnos may be recognized as a remnant of a Mycenaean population.\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=c>French reports: \"The fourth and final season of the survey of the Skourta plain was conducted in 1989 by M. and M.L.Z. Munn ([[American School of Classical Studies at Athens|ASCS]]). Explorations begun in 1985 and 1987 were extended into new parts of the plain and surrounding valleys, so that by now a representative portion (approximately 25%) of most of the inhabitable areas of the three koinotites of Pyli, Skourta, and Stefani have been examined intensively. 66 sites were discovered or studied for the first time in the course of this highly productive season, yielding a total of 120 premodern sites studied by our survey since 1985. The survey should have identified all major settlement sites (over 5&nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]]) and a representative sample of smaller sites in the study area. A summary of the chief conclusions to be drawn from the four seasons can be made...MH settlement is established on two summits overlooking the plain...one of which, Panakton...becomes the most substantial LH site in the area. A fortified MH settlement is also established on a peak in rugged country beyond the NE edge of the plain...between the Mazareika and Vountima valleys, in which other settlements are established in the LH era...The remoteness of this NE sector, and the great natural strength of the MH site and a nearby LH IIIC citadel...suggest that the inhabitants of these glens and crags sought to protect and separate themselves from peoples beyond the peaks that surrounded them, perhaps because they were ethnically distinct and economically more or less independent of the Myc Greeks who dominated the plains. Traditions of Pelasgians in these mountains at the end of the [[Bronze Age|BA]] raise the possibility that these may have been Pelasgian sites. Once abandoned, in the LH IIIC or [[Protogeometric art|PG]] eras, most of these sites in the NE sector are not again inhabited for well over a millennium. Elsewhere, within the more accessible expanse of the Skourta plain itself, LH settlements are established on many sites which are later again important in the C era...\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Abel|first=V.

In general, \"Pelasgian\" has come to mean more broadly all the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous inhabitants]] of the [[Aegean Sea]] region and their cultures, \"a hold-all term for any ancient, primitive and presumably indigenous people in the Greek world\".<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodios|Green|2007|loc=p. 223 (Commentary on I.987)}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Classical Greece|classical period]], enclaves under that name survived in several locations of mainland Greece, [[Crete]], and other regions of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. Populations identified as \"Pelasgian\" spoke a language or languages that at the time Greeks identified as \"[[barbarians|barbaric]]\", though some ancient writers nonetheless described the Pelasgians as [[Greeks]]. A tradition also survived that large parts of Greece had once been Pelasgian before being [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]. These parts fell largely, though far from exclusively, within the territory which by the 5th century BC was inhabited by those speakers of [[ancient Greek]] who were identified as [[Ionians]] and [[Aeolians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ionian|title=Ionian|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nMuch like all other aspects of the \"Pelasgians\", their ethnonym (''Pelasgoi'') is of extremely uncertain provenance and [[etymology]]. Michel Sakellariou collects fifteen different etymologies proposed for it by philologists and linguists during the last 200&nbsp;years, though he admits that \"most ... are fanciful\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sakellariou|1977|pp=101\u2013104}}.</ref>\n\nAn ancient etymology based on mere similarity of sounds linked ''pelasgos'' to ''pelargos'' (\"[[stork]]\") and postulates that the Pelasgians were migrants like storks, possibly from [[Egypt]], where they nest.<ref>[[Strabo]]. ''Geography'', 5.2.4.</ref> [[Aristophanes]] deals effectively with this etymology in his comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]''. One of the laws of \"the storks\" in the satirical [[cloud-cuckoo-land]], playing upon the Athenian belief that they were originally Pelasgians, is that grown-up storks must support their parents by migrating elsewhere and conducting warfare.<ref>Aristophanes. ''The Birds'', 1355ff.</ref>\n  \n[[Gilbert Murray]] summarizes the derivation from ''pelas g\u0113'' (\"neighboring land\"), current at his time: \"If Pelasgoi is connected with \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2, 'near', the word would mean 'neighbor' and would denote the nearest strange people to the invading Greeks\".<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|1960|p=43}}.</ref>\n \n[[Julius Pokorny]] derives Pelasgoi from ''*pelag-skoi'' (\"flatland-inhabitants\"); specifically \"inhabitants of the [[Thessalian plain]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Pokorny|1969|pp=831\u2013832}}.</ref> He details a previous derivation, which appears in English at least as early as [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]'s ''Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstone|1858|loc=Chapter 2, Section 3, \"Derivation of the Pelasgian Name\", pp. 211\u2013215}}.</ref> If the Pelasgians were not Indo-Europeans, the name in this derivation must have been assigned by the Hellenes. [[Ernest Klein]] argued that the ancient Greek word for \"sea\", ''pelagos'' and the Doric word ''plagos'', \"side\" (which is flat) shared the same root, *pl\u0101k-, and that ''*pelag-skoi'' therefore meant \"the sea men\", where the sea is flat.<ref>{{harvnb|Klein|1966|loc=\"Pelasgian and Pelagic\"}}.</ref> This could be connected to the maritime marauders referred to as the [[Sea People]] in Egyptian records. Subsequent scholarship shows that the connection between the two roots is \"phonetically impossible\".<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009|p=1165}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient literary evidence==\n[[File:Pelasgian presence in ancient texts (English).svg|thumb|Map of Pelasgians and Pelasgus.]]\nLiterary analysis has been ongoing since [[classical Greece]], when the writers of those times read previous works on the subject. No definitive answers were ever forthcoming by this method; it rather served to better define the problems. The method perhaps reached a peak in the [[Victorian era]] when new methods of systematic comparison began to be applied in [[philology]]. Typical of the era is the study by [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a trained classicist.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstone|1858}}. The Pelasgians are covered especially in Volume I.</ref> Until further ancient texts come to light, advances on the subject cannot be made. The most likely source of progress regarding the Pelasgians continues to be archaeology and related sciences.\n\n===Poets===\n\n====Homer====\nThe Pelasgians first appear in the poems of [[Homer]]: those who are stated to be Pelasgians in the ''[[Iliad]]'' are among the allies of [[Troy]]. In the section known as the ''[[Catalogue of Trojans]]'', they are mentioned between mentions of the [[Hellespont]]ine cities and the [[Thracians]] of south-eastern Europe (i.e.,&nbsp;on the Hellespontine border of [[Thrace]]).<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 2.840\u20132.843. The camp at [[Troy]] is mentioned in ''Iliad'', 10.428\u201310.429.</ref> Homer calls their town or district \"Larisa\"<ref>Not the same as the [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]], Greece. Many towns bearing the same (or similar) name existed.</ref> and characterises it as fertile, and its inhabitants as celebrated for their spearsmanship. He records their chiefs as [[Hippothous]] and [[Pylaeus]], sons of Lethus son of Teutamus, thus giving all of them names that were Greek or so thoroughly [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] that any foreign element has been effaced.\n\nIn the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus, affecting to be Cretan himself, instances Pelasgians among the tribes in the ninety cities of [[Crete]], \"language mixing with language side by side\".<ref>Homer. ''Odyssey'', 19.175\u201319.177 ([[Robert Fagles]]'s translation).</ref> Last on his list, Homer distinguishes them from other ethnicities on the island: \"Cretans proper\", Achaeans, Cydonians (of the city of Cydonia/modern [[Chania]]), Dorians, and \"noble Pelasgians\".<ref>Homer. ''Odyssey'', Book 19 (T.E. Lawrence's translation).</ref>\n\nThe ''Iliad'' also refers to \"Pelasgic Argos\",<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 2.681\u20132.684.</ref> which is most likely to be the [[plain of Thessaly]],<ref>The location is never explicitly given. Gladstone shows, by process of elimination, that it must be in the north of Thessaly. ({{harvnb|Gladstone|1858|pp=100\u2013105}}.)</ref> and to \"Pelasgic [[Zeus]]\", living in and ruling over [[Dodona]],<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', 16.233\u201316.235.</ref> which must be the oracular one in [[Epirus]]. However, neither passage mentions actual Pelasgians; [[Myrmidons]], Hellenes, and Achaeans specifically inhabit Thessaly and the Selloi are around Dodona. They all fought on the Greek side.\n\n[[File:Thessaly Plain.jpg|thumb|250px|Plain of [[Thessaly]], to the west of classical Pelasgiotis, but in the original range of the Pelasgians. The [[Pindus Mountains]] are visible in the background. The river is the [[Pineios River (Thessaly)|Peneus]].]] \n\nAccording to the ''Iliad'', Pelasgians were camping out on the shore together with the following tribes,\n\n<blockquote>Towards the sea lie the [[Carians]] and the [[Paeonians]], with curved bows, and the [[Leleges]] and [[Caucones]], and the goodly Pelasgi.<ref>Homer.

''Histories'', 1.57. ({{harvnb|Herodotus|Strassler|2009|loc=p. 32)}}.)</ref>\nThe entire territory later called Greece was first called Pelasgia (Herodotus 1942,2:56). These Pelasgians had lived in Samothrace , the island just north of Troy, before they came to Attice (2:51). In Northwestern Peloponnesus the Ionians \"inhabited the land now called Achaea and were called, according to the Greek account, Aegialean Pelasgi, or Pelasgi of the Sea Shore\"; afterwars they were called Ionians (7:94). \"The Islanders ... were a Pelasgian race, who in later times took the name Ionians. The Aeolians too were anciently called Pelasgians (7:95). Their language was different from Greek. The original Athenians were Pelasgians who spoke the \"barbarous\" Pelasgian language (1:57). Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians on the island of Lemnos opposite Troy once kidnapped Hellenic women of Athens for wives, but the Athenian wives created a crisis by teaching their children \"the language of Attica\" instead of the Pelasgian (6:138). Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians spoke a language unlike that of any of their neighbours (1:57). The Pelasgians antedated the Greeks in what was later called Greece. Herodotus characterized the Hellenic Athenians as \"excessively migratory,\" but stated that \"the Pelasgians or Lacedaemons\" had always been there (1:56). Significantly enough, he identified the Spartans as Pelasgians rather than Greeks. The Hellenic race increased because numerous tribes of barbarians voluntarily entered their ranks (1:58).  \n<blockquote>I am unable to state with certainty what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia in the city of Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.</blockquote>\n\nHerodotus alludes to other districts where Pelasgian peoples lived on under changed names; [[Samothrace]]<ref>Herodotus.

They were originally natives of \"Achaean Argos\" descended from Pelasgus, the son of Zeus and Niobe. They migrated from there to Haemonia (later called Thessaly), where they \"drove out the barbarian inhabitants\" and divided the country into Phthiotis, Achaia, and Pelasgiotis, named after Achaeus, Phthius and Pelasgus, \"the sons of Larissa and Poseidon.\" Subsequently, \"about the sixth generation they were driven out by the [[Curetes (tribe)|Curetes]] and [[Leleges]], who are now called [[Aetolia]]ns and [[Locris|Locrians]]\".\n\nFrom there, the Pelasgians dispersed to [[Crete]], the [[Cyclades]], Histaeotis, [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], [[Euboea]], the coast along the [[Hellespont]] and the islands, especially [[Lesbos]], which had been colonized by [[Macar]] son of [[Crinacus]]. Most went to [[Dodona]] and eventually being driven from there to [[Italy]] then called Saturnia. They landed at [[Spina]] at the mouth of the [[Po River]]. Still others crossed the [[Apennine Mountains]] to [[Umbria]] and being driven from there went to the country of the Aborigines. These consented to a treaty and settled them at [[Velia]]. They and the Aborigenes took over Umbria but were dispossessed by the [[Tyrrhenians]]. The author continues to detail the tribulations of the Pelasgians and then goes on to the Tyrrhenians, whom he is careful to distinguish from the Pelasgians.\n\n===Geographers===\n====Pausanias====\nIn his ''[[Description of Greece]]'', [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]] who state that [[Pelasgus]] (along with his followers) was the first inhabitant of their land.<ref>Pausanias.

Of his own opinions he says:<ref name=Strabo5.2.4/>\n\n<blockquote>As for the Pelasgi, almost all agree, in the first place, that some ancient tribe of that name spread throughout the whole of Greece, and particularly among the Aeolians of Thessaly.</blockquote>\n\nHe defines Pelasgian Argos as being \"between the outlets of the [[Peneus]] River and [[Thermopylae]] as far as the mountainous country of [[Pindus]]\" and states that it took its name from Pelasgian rule. He includes also the tribes of [[Epirus]] as Pelasgians (based on the opinions of \"many\"). [[Lesbos]] is named Pelasgian. [[Caere]] was settled by Pelasgians from Thessaly, who called it by its former name, \"Agylla\". Pelasgians also settled around the mouth of the [[Tiber River]] in [[Italy]] at [[Pyrgi]] and a few other settlements under a king, Maleos.<ref>Strabo.

Some of the more prevalent theories supported by scholarship are presented below. Since Greek is classified as an [[Indo-European language]], the major question of concern is whether Pelasgian was an Indo-European language.\n\nGarcia-Ramon (2004) remarked that \"the attempt to determine phonological rules for an Indo-European pre-Greek language ('Pelasgian') ... is considered a complete failure today\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Greece, Languages|author=Garc\u00eda-Ram\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds|editor=Hubert Cancik and Helmut Schneider|title=Brill's New Pauly, vol. 5|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|pages=999-1000}}</ref>, while Beekes (2018) agrees, noting that \"one of the demerits of Georgiev's Pelasgian theory was that it drew attention away from the Pre-Greek material itself\", concluding that \"the search for Pelasgian was an expensive and useless distraction\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Beekes |authorlink1=Robert S.

Before they heard the names of the gods, the Pelasgians (assuming, interestingly, the existence of a number of gods) called them simply \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03af, on the grounds that they had 'established (\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) all affairs in their order'.

All of these discoveries showed significant resemblances to the Neolithic discoveries made on the Thessalian acropolises of [[Sesklo]] and [[Dimini]]. These discoveries help provide physical confirmation of the literary tradition that describes the Athenians as the descendants of the Pelasgians, who appear to descend continuously from the Neolithic inhabitants in Thessaly. Overall, the archaeological evidence indicates that the site of the Acropolis was inhabited by farmers as early as the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Prokopiou|Smith|1964|pp=21\u201322}}.</ref>{{r|group=Note|a}}\n\nContrary to what Prokopiou suggests about the results of the American excavations near the Clepsydra, Sara Immerwahr in her definitive publication of the prehistoric material unequivocally states that no Dimini-type pottery was unearthed.<ref>{{harvnb|Immerwahr|1971|p=19}}: \"It is the Late Neolithic period that provides most of our parallels, yet, curiously, the striking Dimini-type painted wares of Thessaly are completely lacking, and there is only one small recognisable sherd of the related Mattpainted ware of Central and Southern Greece.\"</ref>\n\n===Lemnos===\nIn August and September 1926, members of the Italian School of Archaeology conducted trial excavations on the island of [[Lemnos]]. A short account of their excavations appeared in the ''Messager d'Ath\u00e9nes'' for 3 January 1927. The overall purpose of the excavations was to shed light on the island's \"Etrusco-Pelasgian\" civilization. The excavations were conducted on the site of the city of Hephaisteia (i.e.,&nbsp;Palaiopolis) where the Pelasgians, according to Herodotus, surrendered to [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] of Athens. There, a necropolis (c.&nbsp;9th-8th centuries BC) was discovered revealing bronze objects, pots, and more than 130 [[ossuaries]]. The ossuaries contained distinctly male and female funeral ornaments. Male ossuaries contained knives and axes whereas female ossuaries contained earrings, bronze pins, necklaces, gold [[diadem]]s, and bracelets. The decorations on some of the gold objects contained spirals of Mycenean origin, but had no Geometric forms. According to their ornamentation, the pots discovered at the site were from the Geometric period. However, the pots also preserved spirals indicative of Mycenean art. The results of the excavations indicate that the Early Iron Age inhabitants of Lemnos could be a remnant of a Mycenaean population and, in addition, the earliest attested reference to Lemnos is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''ra-mi-ni-ja'', \"Lemnian woman\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16906], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heffner|1927|pp=123\u2013124}}.</ref>{{r|group=Note|b}}\n\n===Boeotia===\nDuring the 1980s, the Skourta Plain Project identified Middle Helladic and Late Helladic sites on mountain summits near the plains of [[Skourta]] in [[Boeotia]].

Moreover, the location of the sites is an indication that the Pelasgian inhabitants sought to distinguish themselves \"ethnically\" (a fluid term<ref>{{harvnb|The American Forum for Global Education|2000}}.</ref>) and economically from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] who controlled the Skourta Plain.<ref>{{harvnb|French|1989\u20131990|loc=\"Skourta Plain project\", p. 35}}.</ref>{{r|group=Note|c}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Pelasgians}}\n*[[Barbarian]]\n*[[Dacians]]\n*[[Etruscan civilization]]\n*[[Leleges]]\n*[[Minyans]]\n*[[Names of the Greeks]]\n*[[Old European culture]]\n*[[Paleo-Balkan languages]]\n*[[Pelasgian Creation Myth]]\n*[[Philistines]]\n*[[Pre-Greek substrate]]\n*[[Sea peoples]]\n*[[Falisci|Faliscans]]\n*[[Thracians]]\n*[[Tyrsenians|Tyrsenian]]\n*[[Pallar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=Note |refs=\n<ref name=a>According to Prokopiou: \"Some forty years ago excavations on the Athenian Acropolis and on other sites in Attica brought to light many indications of neolithic life - dwellings, vases, tools, skeletons of sheep - which confirmed the traditions recorded by Herodotus that the Athenians were descended from the Pelasgians, the neolithic inhabitants of Thessaly. Indeed the neolithic vases of Attica date from the earliest neolithic age (5520\u20134900) like the ceramics from the Thessalian acropolis of Sesclos, as well as from the later neolithic age (4900\u20133200) like those from the other Thessalian acropolis of Dimini...The search for traces of the neolithic age on the Acropolis began in 1922 with the excavations of the Italian Archaeological School near the Aesclepium. Another settlement was discovered in the vicinity of the Odeion of Pericles where many sherds of pottery and a stone axe, both of [[Sesklo]] type, were unearthed. Excavations carried out by the American Classical School near the Clepshydra uncovered twenty-one wells and countless pieces of handmade pottery, sherds of [[Dimini]] type, implements of later Stone Age and bones of domestic animals and fish. The discoveries reinforced the theory that permanent settlement by farmers with their flocks, their stone and bone tools and ceramic utensils had taken place on the rock of the Acropolis as early as the sixth millennium.\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=b>Professor Della Seta reports: \"The lack of weapons of bronze, the abundance of weapons of iron, and the type of the pots and the pins gives the impression that the necropolis belongs to the ninth or eighth century BC. That it did not belong to a Greek population, but to a population which, in the eyes of the Hellenes, appeared barbarous, is shown by the weapons. The Greek weapon, dagger or spear, is lacking: the weapons of the barbarians, the axe and the knife, are common. Since, however, this population...preserves so many elements of Mycenaean art, the Tyrrhenians or Pelasgians of Lemnos may be recognized as a remnant of a Mycenaean population.\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=c>French reports: \"The fourth and final season of the survey of the Skourta plain was conducted in 1989 by M. and M.L.Z. Munn ([[American School of Classical Studies at Athens|ASCS]]). Explorations begun in 1985 and 1987 were extended into new parts of the plain and surrounding valleys, so that by now a representative portion (approximately 25%) of most of the inhabitable areas of the three koinotites of Pyli, Skourta, and Stefani have been examined intensively. 66 sites were discovered or studied for the first time in the course of this highly productive season, yielding a total of 120 premodern sites studied by our survey since 1985. The survey should have identified all major settlement sites (over 5&nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]]) and a representative sample of smaller sites in the study area. A summary of the chief conclusions to be drawn from the four seasons can be made...MH settlement is established on two summits overlooking the plain...one of which, Panakton...becomes the most substantial LH site in the area. A fortified MH settlement is also established on a peak in rugged country beyond the NE edge of the plain...between the Mazareika and Vountima valleys, in which other settlements are established in the LH era...The remoteness of this NE sector, and the great natural strength of the MH site and a nearby LH IIIC citadel...suggest that the inhabitants of these glens and crags sought to protect and separate themselves from peoples beyond the peaks that surrounded them, perhaps because they were ethnically distinct and economically more or less independent of the Myc Greeks who dominated the plains. Traditions of Pelasgians in these mountains at the end of the [[Bronze Age|BA]] raise the possibility that these may have been Pelasgian sites. Once abandoned, in the LH IIIC or [[Protogeometric art|PG]] eras, most of these sites in the NE sector are not again inhabited for well over a millennium. Elsewhere, within the more accessible expanse of the Skourta plain itself, LH settlements are established on many sites which are later again important in the C era...\"</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Abel|first=V.

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979.\n\nThompson was a pioneer in the study of [[Late Antiquity]], and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. Drawing upon a massive amount of research, Thompson revitalized [[English language|English-language]] scholarship on the history of early [[Germanic peoples]]. Having experienced the barbarity of [[Nazism]] first-hand, Thompson was a [[Marxism|Marxist]], and worked towards detaching the study of Germanic peoples from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. \n\n==Early life==\nEdward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], Ireland to a strictly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} His father, Robert James Thompson, who was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, worked for the [[National Health Insurance]]. His mother, Margaret Murison, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} Thompson graduated from [[The High School, Dublin]], and then entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] with a [[sizar]]ship, a distinction he shared with [[Jonathan Swift]]. He was the first of his family to enter university.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}  Thompson graduated with [[First-class honours|first class honours]] in [[classics]] from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the choice of his headmaster at The High School.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\nFrom 1937\u20131938, Thompson was an [[exchange student]] in [[Berlin]]. While in Germany, Thompson experienced at first hand the barbarism of [[Nazism]]. He recalled having witnessed the smashing of a jeweler's shop by a Nazi mob.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}} These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future cautious approach to the study of [[Germanic peoples]], which was to characterize his approach to this subject.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|right|upright=1|thumb|Distribution of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson]]\nThompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as lecturer in classics, was a two-year stint at Trinity College Dublin. Although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nAlready prepared to enter [[World War II]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]] in 1941 through the help of his friend [[Benjamin Farrington]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}} From Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first books, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'' (1947), and ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (1948). Both were later reprinted.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Career at the University of Nottingham==\nThompson moved again in 1948{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where he worked from 1948 to 1979.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} During this time, Thompson contributed to the increasing quality of studies of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=684}} He was considered the leading scholar in the United Kingdom in the field.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}} At Nottingham, Thompson focused mainly on research and teaching rather than administrative work.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Thompson sought to approach the subject without ideological ballast.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}} Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism probably influenced his research of this field.{{sfn|Markus|2001|pp=680-681}} His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies,{{sfn|Todd|2004}} in which he was the leading scholar of his generation. He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} \n\nThompson published his work ''The Early Germans'' in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society through its encounter with [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=687}} His works on early Germanic peoples, such as the [[Visigoths]], quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}} Thompson's reliance on primary sources to examine the past, and his attempts to establish clarity in the field, distinguished him from many more recent historians, who are heavily influenced by [[critical theory]] and consider primary sources unreliable.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Edward Thompson... was the leading scholar of his generation on the history of the Germanic migrations... His academic achievement was to apply modern historical analysis to the study of the Germanic tribes, escaping the influence of 19th-century romantic myths...{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}}\n |author = \u2014 [[The Guardian]]\n |source =\n |align =\n |width = 20%\n}}\n \nUntil his retirement in 1979, Thompson served as the first Chairman of the Editorial Board of the scholarly journal ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', founded by [[Lewis Thorpe]] in 1957.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=683}} Thompson was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1964{{spaced ndash}}the first University of Nottingham academic to be so honoured.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=683}}\n\n==Later life==\nThompson retired from the University of Nottingham in 1979. After his retirement Thompson spent a year at the [[University of Wisconsin]], during which he produced four major papers which were later printed in the collection ''Romans and Barbarians: the Decline of the Western Empire'' (1982). Thompson subsequently shifted his focus to the end of [[Roman Britain]], on which he published the monographs ''Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain'' (1984) and ''Who was Saint Patrick?'' (1985). Thompson died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Politics==\nThompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Friedrich Engels]]. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington, Thompson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} The influence of Marxism is present in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}}\n\nThompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]]. In later life he referred to himself as a Thompsonist rather than a Marxist.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} His academic work continued to demonstrate a Marxist-oriented outlook on history. The class structure of societies continued to play a central role in his studies.{{sfn|Markus|1994}} No longer playing an active part in politics, he maintained an enthusiastic interest.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} He was strongly opposed to the Soviet handling of the [[Prague Spring]], and criticised British policy in [[Northern Ireland]], particularly [[Sectarian violence|secterian violence]].{{sfn|Todd|2004}} \n\n==Personal life==\nWhile lecturing at King's College Thompson met his first wife Thelma Marjorie Phelps, a physician, whom he married in 1945.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} They had a son and a daughter, but separated in 1958. In 1964 he married Hazel Joyce Casken, with whom he had a daughter and lived until his death.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}}\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1947 |title=The Historical Work of Ammianus Marcellinus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRc8AAAAIAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1948 |title=A History of Attila and the Huns |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnPxAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=9780837176406}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1952 |title=A Roman Reformer and Inventor: Being a New Text of the Treatise De Rebus Bellicis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz3NxQEACAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1965 |title=The Early Germans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxNoAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1966 |title=The Visigoths in the Time of Ulfila |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7JmAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1969 |title=The Goths in Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HccPvwEACAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=9780198142713}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1982 |title=Romans and Barbarians: The Decline of the Western Empire |url=https://books.google.no/books?id=2GFoAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |page= |isbn=9780299087005}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1984 |title=Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5WbQgAACAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Boydell Press]] |page= |isbn=9780851154053}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1985 |title=Who Was Saint Patrick? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jee3ivfHtHsC |location= |publisher=[[Boydell & Brewer]] |page= |isbn=9780851157177}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Herwig Wolfram]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite news |last1=Markus |first1=Robert Austin |author-link1= |date=6 January 1994 |year= |title=Obituary: Professor Edward Thompson |trans-title= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-edward-thompson-1398226.html |url-status= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |department= |work= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[The Independent]] |agency= |page= |pages= |at= |doi= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Markus |first1=Robert Austin |author-link1= |date= |year=2001 |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Edward Arthur Thompson |script-title= |trans-title= |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/111p679.pdf |access-date=22 January 2020 |url-access= |format= |department= |journal=[[Proceedings of the British Academy]] |type= |series= |language= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |publication-place= |publication-date= |volume=111 |issue= |page= |pages=679\u2013693 |at= |nopp= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |bibcode-access= |biorxiv= |citeseerx= |doi= |doi-access= |doi-broken-date= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |jstor-access= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |ol-access= |osti= |osti-access= |pmc= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status= |via= |layurl= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= |postscript= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |date=31 January 1994 |year= |title=Edward Thompson |trans-title= |url=https://theguardian.newspapers.com/image/260677974/ |url-status= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |department= |work= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |agency= |page=Personal 13 (32) |pages= |at= |doi= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |quote= |ref={{sfnRef|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}}}}\n* {{cite news |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |date=2 February 1994 |year= |title=E.

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979.\n\nThompson was a pioneer in the study of [[Late Antiquity]], and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. Drawing upon a massive amount of research, Thompson revitalized [[English language|English-language]] scholarship on the history of early [[Germanic peoples]]. Having experienced the barbarity of [[Nazism]] first-hand, Thompson was a [[Marxism|Marxist]], and worked towards detaching the study of Germanic peoples from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. \n\n==Early life==\nEdward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], Ireland to a strictly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} His father, Robert James Thompson, who was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, worked for the [[National Health Insurance]]. His mother, Margaret Murison, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} Thompson graduated from [[The High School, Dublin]], and then entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] with a [[sizar]]ship, a distinction he shared with [[Jonathan Swift]]. He was the first of his family to enter university.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}  Thompson graduated with [[First-class honours|first class honours]] in [[classics]] from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the choice of his headmaster at The High School.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\nFrom 1937\u20131938, Thompson was an [[exchange student]] in [[Berlin]]. While in Germany, Thompson experienced at first hand the barbarism of [[Nazism]]. He would often recall having witnessed the smashing of a jeweller\u2019s shop by a Nazi mob.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}} These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future cautious approach to the study of [[Germanic peoples]], which was to characterize his approach to this subject.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|right|upright=1|thumb|Distribution of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson]]\nThompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as lecturer in classics, was a two-year stint at Trinity College Dublin. Although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nAlready prepared to enter [[World War II]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]] in 1941 through the help of his friend [[Benjamin Farrington]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}} From Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first books, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'' (1947), and ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (1948). Both were later reprinted.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Career at the University of Nottingham==\nThompson moved again in 1948{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where he worked from 1948 to 1979.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} During this time, Thompson contributed to the increasing quality of studies of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=684}} He was considered the leading scholar in the United Kingdom in the field.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}} At Nottingham, Thompson focused mainly on research and teaching rather than administrative work.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Thompson sought to approach the subject without ideological ballast.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}} Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism probably influenced his research of this field.{{sfn|Markus|2001|pp=680-681}} His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies,{{sfn|Todd|2004}} in which he was the leading scholar of his generation. He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} \n\nThompson published his work ''The Early Germans'' in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society through its encounter with [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=687}} His works on early Germanic peoples, such as the [[Visigoths]], quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}} Thompson's reliance on primary sources to examine the past, and his attempts to establish clarity in the field, distinguished him from many more recent historians, who are heavily influenced by [[critical theory]] and consider primary sources unreliable.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Edward Thompson... was the leading scholar of his generation on the history of the Germanic migrations... His academic achievement was to apply modern historical analysis to the study of the Germanic tribes, escaping the influence of 19th-century romantic myths...{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}}\n |author = \u2014 [[The Guardian]]\n |source =\n |align =\n |width = 20%\n}}\n \nUntil his retirement in 1979, Thompson served as the first Chairman of the Editorial Board of the scholarly journal ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', founded by [[Lewis Thorpe]] in 1957.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=683}} Thompson was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1964{{spaced ndash}}the first University of Nottingham academic to be so honoured.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=683}}\n\n==Later life==\nThompson retired from the University of Nottingham in 1979. After his retirement Thompson spent a year at the [[University of Wisconsin]], during which he produced four major papers which were later printed in the collection ''Romans and Barbarians: the Decline of the Western Empire'' (1982). Thompson subsequently shifted his focus to the end of [[Roman Britain]], on which he published the monographs ''Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain'' (1984) and ''Who was Saint Patrick?'' (1985). Thompson died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Politics==\nThompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Friedrich Engels]]. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington, Thompson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} The influence of Marxism is present in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}}\n\nThompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]]. In later life he referred to himself as a Thompsonist rather than a Marxist.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} His academic work continued to demonstrate a Marxist-oriented outlook on history. The class structure of societies continued to play a central role in his studies.{{sfn|Markus|1994}} No longer playing an active part in politics, he maintained an enthusiastic interest.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} He was strongly opposed to the Soviet handling of the [[Prague Spring]], and criticised British policy in [[Northern Ireland]], deploring the secterian violence being carried out there.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} \n\n==Personal life==\nWhile lecturing at King's College Thompson met his first wife Thelma Marjorie Phelps, a physician, whom he married in 1945.{{sfn|Todd|2004}} They had a son and a daughter, but separated in 1958. In 1964 he married Hazel Joyce Casken, with whom he had a daughter and lived happily until his death.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}}\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1947 |title=The Historical Work of Ammianus Marcellinus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRc8AAAAIAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1948 |title=A History of Attila and the Huns |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnPxAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=9780837176406}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1952 |title=A Roman Reformer and Inventor: Being a New Text of the Treatise De Rebus Bellicis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz3NxQEACAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1965 |title=The Early Germans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxNoAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1966 |title=The Visigoths in the Time of Ulfila |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7JmAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1969 |title=The Goths in Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HccPvwEACAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |page= |isbn=9780198142713}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1982 |title=Romans and Barbarians: The Decline of the Western Empire |url=https://books.google.no/books?id=2GFoAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |page= |isbn=9780299087005}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1984 |title=Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5WbQgAACAAJ |location= |publisher=[[Boydell Press]] |page= |isbn=9780851154053}}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |date=1985 |title=Who Was Saint Patrick? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jee3ivfHtHsC |location= |publisher=[[Boydell & Brewer]] |page= |isbn=9780851157177}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Herwig Wolfram]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite news |last1=Markus |first1=Robert Austin |author-link1= |date=6 January 1994 |year= |title=Obituary: Professor Edward Thompson |trans-title= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-edward-thompson-1398226.html |url-status= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |department= |work= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[The Independent]] |agency= |page= |pages= |at= |doi= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Markus |first1=Robert Austin |author-link1= |date= |year=2001 |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Edward Arthur Thompson |script-title= |trans-title= |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/111p679.pdf |access-date=22 January 2020 |url-access= |format= |department= |journal=[[Proceedings of the British Academy]] |type= |series= |language= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |publication-place= |publication-date= |volume=111 |issue= |page= |pages=679\u2013693 |at= |nopp= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |bibcode-access= |biorxiv= |citeseerx= |doi= |doi-access= |doi-broken-date= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |jstor-access= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |ol-access= |osti= |osti-access= |pmc= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status= |via= |layurl= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= |postscript= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |date=31 January 1994 |year= |title=Edward Thompson |trans-title= |url=https://theguardian.newspapers.com/image/260677974/ |url-status= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |department= |work= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |agency= |page=Personal 13 (32) |pages= |at= |doi= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |quote= |ref={{sfnRef|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}}}}\n* {{cite news |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |date=2 February 1994 |year= |title=E.
