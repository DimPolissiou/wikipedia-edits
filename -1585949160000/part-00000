{"title_page": "Organic movement", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:Organic Produce.jpg|thumb|297x297px|Organic tomatoes]]\nThe '''organic movement''' broadly refers to the organizations and individuals involved worldwide in the promotion of [[organic farming]] and other organic products. It started around the first half of the 20th century, when modern large-scale agricultural practices began to appear.\n\n==Overview and origin==\nThe term \u201corganic\u201d can be broadly described as food that is not genetically engineered and grown without the assistance of toxic chemicals, including many synthetic pesticides, the use of arsenic, and fertilization using biosolids, which are often found to contain flame retardants and drugs among other things, even though they are processed. The term \"organic farming\" was coined by Lord Northbourne in 1940.<ref name=N1940>Paull, John [https://www.academia.edu/9254016/Lord_Northbourne_the_man_who_invented_organic_farming_a_biography Lord Northbourne, the man who invented organic farming, a biography.] Journal of Organic Systems, 2014, 9(1), 31-53.</ref> The beginnings of the organic movement can be traced back to the beginning of the 1800s. In 1840 [[Justus Von Liebig]] developed a theory of mineral plant nutrition. Liebig believed that [[manure]] could be directly substituted by certain mineral salts. Many years later in 1910, preceding the First World War, chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] developed an ammonia synthesis process, making use of nitrogen from the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Fritz Haber|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/fritz-haber|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> This form of ammonia had already been used to manufacture explosives, so after the war, it was implemented into the fertilization of agriculture.\n\nThe organic movement began in the early 1900s in response to the shift towards synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides in the early days of [[industrial agriculture]]. A relatively small group of farmers  came together in various associations: [[Demeter International]] of Germany, which encouraged [[biodynamic farming]] and began the first certification program, the [[Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society]],<ref name=\"Paull2008\">Paull, John [http://www.orgprints.org/15089/1/15089new.pdf \"The Lost History of Organic Farming in Australia\"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2008, 3(2):2-17.</ref> the [[Soil Association]] of the United Kingdom, and [[Rodale Press]] in the United States, along with others. In 1972 these organizations joined to form the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM). In recent years, environmental awareness has driven demand and conversion to organic farming. Some governments, including the European Union, have begun to support organic farming through [[agricultural subsidy]] reform. Organic production and marketing have grown at a fast pace.\n\nHistorians consider [[Albert Howard]], [[Viscount Lymington]], [[Robert McCarrison]], [[Edgar J. Saxon]] and [[Frank Newman Turner]] as pioneers of the organic movement in Britain.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Conford, Philip|year=1998|title=A Forum for Organic Husbandry: The \"New English Weekly\" and Agricultural Policy, 1939\u20131949|journal=[[Agricultural History Review]]|volume=46|issue=2|pages=197-210}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Conford, Philip|year=2002|title=The Myth of Neglect: Responses to the Early Organic Movement, 1930-1950 |journal=[[Agricultural History Review]]|volume=50|issue=1|pages=80-106}}</ref><ref>Lockeretz, William.

The term derives from his concept of \"the farm as organism\", which he expounded in his book, Look to the Land (1940), and in which he described a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming. Northbourne wrote of \"chemical farming versus organic farming\". http://www.orgprints.org/10138.\n* In 1939, strongly influenced by Sir Howard's work, [[Lady Eve Balfour]] launched the [[Haughley Experiment]] on farmland in England. It was the first, side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional farming. Four years later, she published ''[[The Living Soil]]'', based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. It was widely read, and lead to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the [[Soil Association]].\n* [[Sir Albert Howard]]'s 1940 book, ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', was influential in promoting organic techniques, and his 1947 book \"The Soil and Health, A Study of Organic Agriculture\" adopted Northbourne's terminology and was the first book to include \"organic\" agriculture or farming in its title.\n* During the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a research topic of interest. The science tended to concentrate on the new chemical approaches. In the [[United States|U.S.]], [[J.I. Rodale]] began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing. In addition to agricultural research, Rodale's publications through the [[Rodale Press]] helped to promote [[organic gardening]] to the general public.\n* In 1962, [[Rachel Carson]], a prominent scientist and [[Natural history|naturalist]], published ''[[Silent Spring]]'', chronicling the effects of [[DDT]] and other pesticides on the environment drawing on the research of [[biodynamic agriculture]] advocates [[Marjorie Spock]], Mary T. Richards and [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]].<ref name=RCarson>Paull, John (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/9149162/The_Rachel_Carson_letters_and_the_making_of_Silent_Spring  \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring\"],   SAGE Open, 3 (July), pp. 1-12.</ref><sup>[9]</sup> A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, ''Silent Spring'' was instrumental in the US government's 1972 banning of DDT. The book and its author are often credited with launching the environmental movement.<ref name=RCarson/>\n* In the 1970s, worldwide movements concerned with environmental pollution caused by persistent agrichemical increased attention on organic farming. One goal of the ''organic movement'' was to promote consumption of [[Local food|locally grown food]], which was promoted through slogans such as ''\"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\"''.\n* In 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ([[IFOAM]]), was founded in Versailles, France. IFOAM was dedicated to the diffusion of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In the same year, [[John Battendieri]] founded Santa Cruz Organics, which marketed some of the first packaged organic products.<sup>[10]</sup>\n* In the 1980s, around the world, various farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production to ensure standards of production. This led to various legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. Currently, most aspects of organic food production are government-regulated in the US and the European Union.\n* In the 2000s, the worldwide market for organic products (including food, beauty, health, bodycare, and household products, and fabrics) has grown rapidly. More countries are establishing formal, government-regulated [[Organic certification]]. Monitoring and challenging certification rules and decisions have become a regular, high profile aspect of activists in the organic movement.\n\n==Organic food==\n{{Main|Organic food}}\nSpecifications for what may be classified as organic food may vary by location. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance the quality of the environment.<ref>\u201cIntroduction to Organic Practices.\u201d Introduction to Organic Practices | Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA, www.ams.usda.gov/publications/content/introduction-organic-practices.\n</ref> Organic poultry and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, bioengineering, and ionizing radiation. Before a product can be labeled \"organic\", a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards. Companies that handle or process organic food before it reaches supermarkets and restaurants must be certified as well.\n\n==Organic companies==\nThe recent interest in the organic industry has sparked the interest of many businesses from small local distributors to large companies that distribute many products nationally. The organic market is now a 14 billion dollar a year industry, that continues to grow especially from large corporations such as Wal-Mart that are now offering organic choices to their customers.<ref>[http://cnas.tamu.edu/The%20New%20Horizon%20for%20Organics.pdf Clark, Georgia. \"The New Horizon for Organics: A Market Outlook of the Effects of Wal-Mart on the International Organic Market\".

Some large companies have bought smaller already established organic companies such as Earth\u2019s Best, Rice Dream soy milk, Garden of Eatin', Celestial Seasonings and Health Valley. When larger companies buy smaller companies it is called [[stealth ownership]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Emergent-Agriculture-Farming-Sustainability-Economy/dp/0865717737/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461723770&sr=8-1&keywords=emergent+agriculture|title=The Emergent Agriculture: Farming, Sustainability and the Return of the Local Economy|last=Kleppel|first=Gary|last2=Ikerd|first2=John|date=2014-07-22|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=9780865717732|language=English}}</ref>\n\n==Organic cosmetics==\nOrganic cosmetics are products that are made with organic ingredients that were produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers.\n\nThe [https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/Claims/ucm203078.htm FDA] does not have a definition of \u201cOrganic\u201d in terms of organic cosmetics. FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]  (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA).\n\nThe USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) requirements for the use of the term \u201corganic\u201d are separate from the laws and regulations that FDA applies for cosmetics. For more information on \"organic\" labeling for cosmetics, see the NOP publication, \"[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5068442 Cosmetics, Body Care Products, and Personal Care Products].\" Cosmetic products labeled with \u201corganic\u201d must follow both USDA regulations and FDA regulations of organic claims for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA supervises the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP). The NOP regulations have the definition of \u201corganic\u201d and provide certification for agricultural ingredients if they have been produced under conditions that would meet the definition. Moreover, the regulations also include labeling standards based on the percentage of organic ingredients in every product.<ref>[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_10/7cfr205_10.html Gpo.gov]</ref>\n\nThe [[Cosmos (standard)|COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard]] (COSMOS) sets certification requirements for organic and natural cosmetics products in Europe.<ref name=\"Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS\">{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organic farming==\nOrganic farming is a form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as [[crop rotation]], green manure, compost, and biological pest control.\n{{Main|Organic farming}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nThere have been multiple criticisms regarding organic food and organic marketing practices.

It started around the first half of the 20th century, when modern large-scale agricultural practices began to appear.\n\n==Overview and origin==\nThe term \u201corganic\u201d can be broadly described as food that is not genetically engineered and grown without the assistance of toxic chemicals, including many synthetic pesticides, the use of arsenic, and fertilization using biosolids, which are often found to contain flame retardants and drugs among other things, even though they are processed. The term \"organic farming\" was coined by Lord Northbourne in 1940.<ref name=N1940>Paull, John [https://www.academia.edu/9254016/Lord_Northbourne_the_man_who_invented_organic_farming_a_biography Lord Northbourne, the man who invented organic farming, a biography.] Journal of Organic Systems, 2014, 9(1), 31-53.</ref> The beginnings of the organic movement can be traced back to the beginning of the 1800s. In 1840 [[Justus Von Liebig]] developed a theory of mineral plant nutrition. Liebig believed that [[manure]] could be directly substituted by certain mineral salts. Many years later in 1910, preceding the First World War, chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] developed an ammonia synthesis process, making use of nitrogen from the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Fritz Haber|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/fritz-haber|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> This form of ammonia had already been used to manufacture explosives, so after the war, it was implemented into the fertilization of agriculture.\n\nThe organic movement began in the early 1900s in response to the shift towards synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides in the early days of [[industrial agriculture]]. A relatively small group of farmers  came together in various associations: [[Demeter International]] of Germany, which encouraged [[biodynamic farming]] and began the first certification program, the [[Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society]],<ref name=\"Paull2008\">Paull, John [http://www.orgprints.org/15089/1/15089new.pdf \"The Lost History of Organic Farming in Australia\"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2008, 3(2):2-17.</ref> the [[Soil Association]] of the United Kingdom, and [[Rodale Press]] in the United States, along with others. In 1972 these organizations joined to form the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM). In recent years, environmental awareness has driven demand and conversion to organic farming. Some governments, including the European Union, have begun to support organic farming through [[agricultural subsidy]] reform. Organic production and marketing have grown at a fast pace.\n\nHistorians consider [[Albert Howard]], [[Viscount Lymington]], [[Robert McCarrison]], [[Edgar J. Saxon]] and [[Frank Newman Turner]] as pioneers of the organic movement in Britain.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Conford, Philip|year=1998|title=A Forum for Organic Husbandry: The \"New English Weekly\" and Agricultural Policy, 1939\u20131949|journal=[[Agricultural History Review]]|volume=46|issue=2|pages=197-210}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Conford, Philip|year=2002|title=The Myth of Neglect: Responses to the Early Organic Movement, 1930-1950 |journal=[[Agricultural History Review]]|volume=50|issue=1|pages=80-106}}</ref><ref>Lockeretz, William.

The term derives from his concept of \"the farm as organism\", which he expounded in his book, Look to the Land (1940), and in which he described a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming. Northbourne wrote of \"chemical farming versus organic farming\". http://www.orgprints.org/10138.\n* In 1939, strongly influenced by Sir Howard's work, [[Lady Eve Balfour]] launched the [[Haughley Experiment]] on farmland in England. It was the first, side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional farming. Four years later, she published ''[[The Living Soil]]'', based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. It was widely read, and lead to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the [[Soil Association]].\n* [[Sir Albert Howard]]'s 1940 book, ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', was influential in promoting organic techniques, and his 1947 book \"The Soil and Health, A Study of Organic Agriculture\" adopted Northbourne's terminology and was the first book to include \"organic\" agriculture or farming in its title.\n* During the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a research topic of interest. The science tended to concentrate on the new chemical approaches. In the [[United States|U.S.]], [[J.I. Rodale]] began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing. In addition to agricultural research, Rodale's publications through the [[Rodale Press]] helped to promote [[organic gardening]] to the general public.\n* In 1962, [[Rachel Carson]], a prominent scientist and [[Natural history|naturalist]], published ''[[Silent Spring]]'', chronicling the effects of [[DDT]] and other pesticides on the environment drawing on the research of [[biodynamic agriculture]] advocates [[Marjorie Spock]], Mary T. Richards and [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]].<ref name=RCarson>Paull, John (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/9149162/The_Rachel_Carson_letters_and_the_making_of_Silent_Spring  \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring\"],   SAGE Open, 3 (July), pp. 1-12.</ref><sup>[9]</sup> A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, ''Silent Spring'' was instrumental in the US government's 1972 banning of DDT. The book and its author are often credited with launching the environmental movement.<ref name=RCarson/>\n* In the 1970s, worldwide movements concerned with environmental pollution caused by persistent agrichemical increased attention on organic farming. One goal of the ''organic movement'' was to promote consumption of [[Local food|locally grown food]], which was promoted through slogans such as ''\"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\"''.\n* In 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ([[IFOAM]]), was founded in Versailles, France. IFOAM was dedicated to the diffusion of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In the same year, [[John Battendieri]] founded Santa Cruz Organics, which marketed some of the first packaged organic products.<sup>[10]</sup>\n* In the 1980s, around the world, various farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production to ensure standards of production. This led to various legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. Currently, most aspects of organic food production are government-regulated in the US and the European Union.\n* In the 2000s, the worldwide market for organic products (including food, beauty, health, bodycare, and household products, and fabrics) has grown rapidly. More countries are establishing formal, government-regulated [[Organic certification]]. Monitoring and challenging certification rules and decisions have become a regular, high profile aspect of activists in the organic movement.\n\n==Organic food==\n{{Main|Organic food}}\nSpecifications for what may be classified as organic food may vary by location. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance the quality of the environment.<ref>\u201cIntroduction to Organic Practices.\u201d Introduction to Organic Practices | Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA, www.ams.usda.gov/publications/content/introduction-organic-practices.\n</ref> Organic poultry and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, bioengineering, and ionizing radiation. Before a product can be labeled \"organic\", a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards. Companies that handle or process organic food before it reaches supermarkets and restaurants must be certified as well.\n\n==Organic companies==\nThe recent interest in the organic industry has sparked the interest of many businesses from small local distributors to large companies that distribute many products nationally. The organic market is now a 14 billion dollar a year industry, that continues to grow especially from large corporations such as Wal-Mart that are now offering organic choices to their customers.<ref>[http://cnas.tamu.edu/The%20New%20Horizon%20for%20Organics.pdf Clark, Georgia. \"The New Horizon for Organics: A Market Outlook of the Effects of Wal-Mart on the International Organic Market\".

FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]  (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA).\n\nThe USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) requirements for the use of the term \u201corganic\u201d are separate from the laws and regulations that FDA applies for cosmetics. For more information on \"organic\" labeling for cosmetics, see the NOP publication, \"[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5068442 Cosmetics, Body Care Products, and Personal Care Products].\" Cosmetic products labeled with \u201corganic\u201d must follow both USDA regulations and FDA regulations of organic claims for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA supervises the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP). The NOP regulations have the definition of \u201corganic\u201d and provide certification for agricultural ingredients if they have been produced under conditions that would meet the definition. Moreover, the regulations also include labeling standards based on the percentage of organic ingredients in every product.<ref>[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_10/7cfr205_10.html Gpo.gov]</ref>\n\nThe [[Cosmos (standard)|COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard]] (COSMOS) sets certification requirements for organic and natural cosmetics products in Europe.<ref name=\"Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS\">{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organic farming==\nOrganic farming is a form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as [[crop rotation]], green manure, compost, and biological pest control.\n{{Main|Organic farming}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nThere have been multiple criticisms regarding organic food and organic marketing practices.

Her photographs are represented in many collections including [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|The Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco]], [[The Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] in Paris, the [[Museum Ludwig|Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany]] as well as many other public and private collections throughout Europe and the Americas.\n\nThroughout the years, Imboden has shown her photography work in groups and solo shows at galleries and museums throughout the United States, South America, Europe and China.\n\nConnie Imboden's first book, ''Out of Darkness,'' with essays compiled by [[Charles-Henri Favrod]] and A.D. Coleman, which won the Silver Medal in Switzerland's \u201cSchonste Bucher Aus Aller Welt (Most Beautiful Book in the World)\u201d Award in 1993.\n\nFollowing the success of \u201cOut of Darkness\u201d, Imboden released two monographs in 1999. The first, \u201cBeauty of Darkness\u201d, features 80 images of her work produced between 1986 and 1998. It also featured introductions by A.D. Coleman and Arthur Ollman. The second book, \u201cThe Raw Seduction of Flesh\u201d, features work produced in 1998 and an introduction by Mitchell Snow.\n\nHer most recent monograph, \u201c[https://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections.html?id=rm19OwAACAAJ&hl=en Reflections; 25 Years of Photography]\u201d, was published in 2009 by Insight Editions with essays by Arthur Ollman, Julian Cox and [[John Wood (poet)|John Wood]].\n\nThroughout the years, Imboden has continued to teach and inspire colleagues and students alike in her quest to push the photographic medium to its highest level. She currently teaches at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], where her experience as a photographer began. Connie has also served as an instructor at [[the Maine Photographic Workshops]], the [[International Center of Photography]] in New York City, the [[Center for Photography at Woodstock|Center for Photography in Woodstock]], the [[Fine Arts Work Center]] in Provincetown, the [[Rencontres d'Arles|Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie]] in France, and the [[Sante Fe Photographic Workshops]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early Work==\nImboden was introduced to photography during the summer following her junior year of high school where she enrolled in a Basic Photography course at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. While previously showing no interest in art, she was inspired by  [[Diane Arbus]]'s work and her expression through photography.  It quickly became a passionate pursuit that would last a lifetime.\n\nExperimenting with negatives by cutting, scratching, and melting them, Imboden's early images are introspective self-portraits that show early signs of the psychological qualities that would eventually become characteristic of her work.  Many of these photographs of the angsty and introspective 16-year-old involve the representation of masks, another recurring theme through Imboden's career.\n\n==Working with Water==\n[[File:Dead Silences I, by Connie Imboden.jpg|thumb|left|Dead Silences I, 1987]]\nImboden's work with water began in 1983 when, while out photographing, she became intrigued by specular bursts of sunlight bouncing off puddles after a heavy rain.  She continued to explore the reflective properties of water until one day a friend volunteered to model nude in a stream Imboden had been photographing in.  The human form, distorted, reflected, and transformed as it is submerged in water, would eventually become the inspiration for her life's work.\n\nImboden would continually discover new ways to explore her subject matter.  Her early images incorporate the moving water of streams or the unavoidable reflection of trees, graphic elements that further transform the figure in ways that heighten the psychological aspect of the work.  Later, in images such as Dead Silences I & II, Imboden photographed above the surface of a black lined kiddie pool, which improved the visibility of the reflection as well as the magnification and refraction of the water.  The images working with this method illustrate elongated forms, fluid and often tranquil due to the stillness of the water.\n\nImboden's work with the human form and water incorporate three distinct layers; the body above the surface of the water, its reflection, and the body submerged.  When she eventually began photographing underwater, she would also use the meniscus of the water to further distort and transform the body.  Her images throughout the years of 1997-2000 feature bizarre, organic forms - familiar in their flesh but alien in their reconstructed form.  In an interview, Imboden is quoted as saying \u201c... there is nothing more repulsive nor more attractive to us than flesh. This confrontation with flesh in an unidentified form makes us uncomfortable. We don\u2019t know what we are looking at, but we know it is human.\u201d\n\n==Working with Mirrors==\n[[File:Connie Imboden, Self Portrait, 1990.jpg|thumb|right|Connie Imboden, Self Portrait, 1990]]\nPhotographing models in water was not an option during the cold winter months for Imboden.  In order to continue working with reflections and the human form through the year, she began working with mirrors in 1989.  The problem, however, was that the mirrors only provided one reflective layer, instead of the three she had grown accustomed to working with that had the potential to distort and transform the figure.  Her early attempts at disrupting the clean, crisp reflections involved smearing oil on the mirror's surface, as seen in Untitled #2455.\n\nSeeking to alter the surface even further, Imboden began scratching the silver backing off of the mirrors she was working with, making them transparent in some places while still reflective in others.  Putting a model behind the mirror made them visible in the areas where the mirror was transparent, while a model in front can be seen in the parts that are still reflective.  Through the relationship of the models in front of and behind the mirror, as well as her camera angle, she discovered a similar effect to the refractive properties of the water.  In the only self-portrait she produced since the 1970s, Self Portrait 1990, Imboden imperfectly lines up her profile in front of the mirror with a models face behind the mirror, creating a distorted portrait by combining two different views into one, reminiscent of the quality of space in a Cubist painting.\n\nThe smearing and scraping of the mirrors soon lead to generating a marred, scratched texture on their surface.

Her photographs are represented in many permanent collections including [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|The Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco]], [[The Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] in Paris, the [[Museum Ludwig|Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany]] as well as many other public and private collections throughout Europe and the Americas.\n\nThroughout the years, Imboden has shown her photography work in groups and solo shows at galleries and museums throughout the United States, South America, Europe and China.\n\nConnie Imboden's first book, entitled ''Out of Darkness'' with essays by [[Charles-Henri Favrod]] and A.D. Coleman, won the Silver Medal in Switzerland's \u201cSchonste Bucher Aus Aller Welt (Most Beautiful Book in the World)\u201d Award in 1993.\n\nFollowing the success of \u201cOut of Darkness\u201d, Imboden released two monographs in 1999. The first, \u201cBeauty of Darkness\u201d, features 80 images of her work produced between 1986 and 1998. It also featured introductions by A.D. Coleman and Arthur Ollman. The second book, \u201cThe Raw Seduction of Flesh\u201d, features work produced in 1998 and an introduction by Mitchell Snow.\n\nHer most recent monograph, \u201c[https://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections.html?id=rm19OwAACAAJ&hl=en Reflections; 25 Years of Photography]\u201d, was published in 2009 by Insight Editions with essays by Arthur Ollman, Julian Cox and [[John Wood (poet)|John Wood]].\n\nThroughout the years, Imboden has continued to teach and inspire colleagues and students alike in her quest to push the photographic medium to its highest level. She currently teaches at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], where her experience as a photographer began. Connie has also served as an instructor at [[the Maine Photographic Workshops]], the [[International Center of Photography]] in New York City, the [[Center for Photography at Woodstock|Center for Photography in Woodstock]], the [[Fine Arts Work Center]] in Provincetown, the [[Rencontres d'Arles|Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie]] in France, and the [[Sante Fe Photographic Workshops]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early Work==\nImboden was introduced to photography during the summer following her junior year in high school when she enrolled in a Basic Photography course at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]].  Having previously shown no interest in art, she was inspired by the penetrating work of [[Diane Arbus]] and the potential for expression through photography.  It quickly became a passionate pursuit that would last a lifetime.\n\nExperimenting with negatives by cutting, scratching, and melting them, Imboden's early images are introspective self-portraits that show early signs of the psychological qualities that would eventually become characteristic of her work.  Many of these photographs of the angsty and introspective 16-year-old involve the representation of masks, another recurring theme through Imboden's career.\n\n==Working with Water==\n[[File:Dead Silences I, by Connie Imboden.jpg|thumb|left|Dead Silences I, 1987]]\nImboden's work with water began in 1983 when, while out photographing, she became intrigued by specular bursts of sunlight bouncing off puddles after a heavy rain.  She continued to explore the reflective properties of water until one day a friend volunteered to model nude in a stream Imboden had been photographing in.  The human form, distorted, reflected, and transformed as it is submerged in water, would eventually become the inspiration for her life's work.\n\nImboden would continually discover new ways to explore her subject matter.  Her early images incorporate the moving water of streams or the unavoidable reflection of trees, graphic elements that further transform the figure in ways that heighten the psychological aspect of the work.  Later, in images such as Dead Silences I & II, Imboden photographed above the surface of a black lined kiddie pool, which improved the visibility of the reflection as well as the magnification and refraction of the water.  The images working with this method illustrate elongated forms, fluid and often tranquil due to the stillness of the water.\n\nImboden's work with the human form and water incorporate three distinct layers; the body above the surface of the water, its reflection, and the body submerged.  When she eventually began photographing underwater, she would also use the meniscus of the water to further distort and transform the body.  Her images throughout the years of 1997-2000 feature bizarre, organic forms - familiar in their flesh but alien in their reconstructed form.  In an interview, Imboden is quoted as saying \u201c... there is nothing more repulsive nor more attractive to us than flesh. This confrontation with flesh in an unidentified form makes us uncomfortable. We don\u2019t know what we are looking at, but we know it is human.\u201d\n\n==Working with Mirrors==\n[[File:Connie Imboden, Self Portrait, 1990.jpg|thumb|right|Connie Imboden, Self Portrait, 1990]]\nPhotographing models in water was not an option during the cold winter months for Imboden.  In order to continue working with reflections and the human form through the year, she began working with mirrors in 1989.  The problem, however, was that the mirrors only provided one reflective layer, instead of the three she had grown accustomed to working with that had the potential to distort and transform the figure.  Her early attempts at disrupting the clean, crisp reflections involved smearing oil on the mirror's surface, as seen in Untitled #2455.\n\nSeeking to alter the surface even further, Imboden began scratching the silver backing off of the mirrors she was working with, making them transparent in some places while still reflective in others.  Putting a model behind the mirror made them visible in the areas where the mirror was transparent, while a model in front can be seen in the parts that are still reflective.  Through the relationship of the models in front of and behind the mirror, as well as her camera angle, she discovered a similar effect to the refractive properties of the water.  In the only self-portrait she produced since the 1970s, Self Portrait 1990, Imboden imperfectly lines up her profile in front of the mirror with a models face behind the mirror, creating a distorted portrait by combining two different views into one, reminiscent of the quality of space in a Cubist painting.\n\nThe smearing and scraping of the mirrors soon lead to generating a marred, scratched texture on their surface.  Resembling the \u201chatching\u201d technique in medieval printmaking, many of Imboden's images that illustrate this texture have a dark, mythological quality to them, as in Untitled #3573.

The cast includes [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], Beatrice Barichella, Andrea Miotto and Francesca Scorsese.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hbo.com/hbo-news/we-are-who-we-are-announcement-guadagnino-sevigny-grazer-braga|title=Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Kid Cudi, and Jack Dylan Grazer Announced as Cast for We Are Who We Are|website=HBO|access-date=19 July 2019|date=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows two American teenagers who live on an American military base with their parents in Italy. The series explores typical teenage drama themes including friendship, love and overall confusion\u2014only in this little slice of America in Italy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Jack Dylan Grazer]] as Fraser Wilson: A detached, slightly odd 14-year-old boy from New York City trying to come to terms with his new living circumstances in a military base in Italy (with his newly-appointed army officer mom and her wife) while also experiencing his own confusing feelings about his identity. He slowly involves himself with a cluster of other Army kids on the base as well as some local Italian teens who all hang out at the beach and indulge themselves too much, and eventually becomes close to Caitlin as they both discover themselves over the golden summer. While everyone thinks he and Caitlin are a couple, he is actually missing his friend Mark back home and also developing an innocent romantic connection with an older soldier named Jason. \n* [[Jordan Kristine Seamon]] as Caitlin Harper: Described as a truly bizarre creature, beautiful but hard-faced and poetic, Caitlin is a dynamic 14-year-old girl who has been living at the base with her military father Richard Harper and her mother Jenny for the past four years. She hunts and learns how to use a semiautomatic rifle with her dad, steers and handles the engine of his fishing vessel, and is a pretty formidable kickboxer. She and Fraser spend the summer figuring out themselves and each other through an intimate and complicated friendship. \n* [[Spence Moore II]] as Danny Harper: Danny is a skinny 17-year-old boy struggling to feel connected with his family and friends on the Italian military base he\u2019s lived on for the last four years. He is prone to bursts of anger, mostly directed toward his younger sister Caitlin, who their father and friends clearly favor. A tragic event with his best friend Craig pushes him to consider feelings of potentially dangerous behavior.\n* Francesca Scorsese as Britney: An attractive platinum 14-year-old blonde who is shamelessly flirty, spirited and loves attention. She\u2019s a social butterfly who knows how to start a party and she holds her friendships dear to her heart. She believes that \u201cwithout friends you can\u2019t do anything\u201d. \n* Ben Taylor as Sam: Handsome and fit 16-year-old, he has been living at the base with his military father and his older brother Craig for many years. He wears his heart on his sleeve and is madly in love with his girlfriend Caitlin, even long after they break up. Sam struggles emotionally with continuing a friendship with Caitlin and attempts to find her replacement in Britney.\n*Corey Knight as Craig: A 20-year-old paratrooper living at the base with his military father and younger brother Sam. He\u2019s very powerful, statuesque, fit, and a mountain of muscles under a kind, relaxed face. He is usually the biggest one in a crowd but with a very humble and kind disposition. He\u2019s not competitive and would allow his friends to beat him in a race to boost their confidence; he would especially do this for his best friend Danny.

A coming-of-age story set in an army base in [[Italy]], the series follows two American 14-year-olds named Fraser Wilson and Caitlin Harper. The cast includes [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], Beatrice Barichella, Andrea Miotto and Francesca Scorsese.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hbo.com/hbo-news/we-are-who-we-are-announcement-guadagnino-sevigny-grazer-braga|title=Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Kid Cudi, and Jack Dylan Grazer Announced as Cast for We Are Who We Are|website=HBO|access-date=19 July 2019|date=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows two American teenagers who live on an American military base with their parents in Italy. The series explores typical teenage drama themes including friendship, love and overall confusion\u2014only in this little slice of America in Italy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Jack Dylan Grazer]] as Fraser Wilson: A detached, slightly odd 14-year-old boy from New York City trying to come to terms with his new living circumstances in a military base in Italy (with his newly-appointed army officer mom and her wife) while also experiencing his own confusing feelings about his identity. He slowly involves himself with a cluster of other Army kids on the base as well as some local Italian teens who all hang out at the beach and indulge themselves too much, and eventually becomes close to Caitlin as they both discover themselves over the golden summer. While everyone thinks he and Caitlin are a couple, he is actually missing his friend Mark back home and also developing an innocent romantic connection with an older soldier named Jason. \n* [[Jordan Kristine Seamon]] as Caitlin Harper: Described as a truly bizarre creature, beautiful but hard-faced and poetic, Caitlin is a dynamic 14-year-old girl who has been living at the base with her military father Richard Harper and her mother Jenny for the past four years. She hunts and learns how to use a semiautomatic rifle with her dad, steers and handles the engine of his fishing vessel, and is a pretty formidable kickboxer. She and Fraser spend the summer figuring out themselves and each other through an intimate and complicated friendship. \n* Spence Moore II as Danny Harper: Danny is a skinny 17-year-old boy struggling to feel connected with his family and friends on the Italian military base he\u2019s lived on for the last four years. He is prone to bursts of anger, mostly directed toward his younger sister Caitlin, who their father and friends clearly favor. A tragic event with his best friend Craig pushes him to consider feelings of potentially dangerous behavior.\n* Francesca Scorsese as Britney: An attractive platinum 14-year-old blonde who is shamelessly flirty, spirited and loves attention. She\u2019s a social butterfly who knows how to start a party and she holds her friendships dear to her heart. She believes that \u201cwithout friends you can\u2019t do anything\u201d. \n* Ben Taylor as Sam: Handsome and fit 16-year-old, he has been living at the base with his military father and his older brother Craig for many years. He wears his heart on his sleeve and is madly in love with his girlfriend Caitlin, even long after they break up. Sam struggles emotionally with continuing a friendship with Caitlin and attempts to find her replacement in Britney.\n*Corey Knight as Craig: A 20-year-old paratrooper living at the base with his military father and younger brother Sam. He\u2019s very powerful, statuesque, fit, and a mountain of muscles under a kind, relaxed face. He is usually the biggest one in a crowd but with a very humble and kind disposition. He\u2019s not competitive and would allow his friends to beat him in a race to boost their confidence; he would especially do this for his best friend Danny. He is dating an Italian local named Valentina who hangs out with him and his cluster of Army friends. \n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Fraser's mom\n* [[Alice Braga]] as Fraser's mom\n* [[Kid Cudi]] as Caitlin's and Danny's dad\n* Faith Alabi as Jenny, Caitlin's and Danny's mom\n* Mozzo as Mozzo\n* Beatrice Barichella \n* Tom Mercier\n* Sebastiano Pigazzi\n* Marco De Nadai\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn February 2019, it was announced that Guadagnino, was in talks with HBO to work on a new one-hour, eight-episode show tentatively titled We Are Who We Are.
