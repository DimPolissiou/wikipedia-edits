However, Williams only played just four games due to a knee injury. At midseason, the team signed free agent [[Cory Alexander]], who was released by the [[1997\u201398 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nThe Nuggets set numerous unwanted records during this season. They won only eleven games, the equal third-fewest in an 82-game NBA season with [[1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks season|the 1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks]], and just like the Mavericks were for a long time viewed as likely to beat [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|the 1972\u201373 76ers]] record of winning only nine games in a full season, and [[2015\u201316 Philadelphia 76ers season|the 2015\u201316 76ers]], who only won just ten games.<ref>\"Nuggets Falter Again: Lose 87\u201375\"; in ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''; December 24, 1997</ref><ref>\"Warriors Pound Nuggets 81\u201369; Wizards Win 97\u201395\"; in ''[[Point Pleasant Register]]''; December 27, 1997; p. 5</ref> After forty games, the Nuggets had a ''2\u201338'' record (winning percentage .050),<ref name=\"schedule\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/1998_games.html 1997\u201398 Denver Nuggets Schedule and Results]</ref> a mark equalled only by [[1993\u201394 Dallas Mavericks season|the 1993\u201394 Mavericks]] and they later lost sixteen consecutive games,<ref name=\"schedule\"/> before finally avoiding a possibility of the worst-ever NBA record against [[1997\u201398 Golden State Warriors season|the Golden State Warriors]] on 27 March.\n\nThe unfortunate season meant head coach [[Bill Hanzlik]] was fired after a single season in charge of the team. Following the season, [[LaPhonso Ellis]] signed as a free agent with the [[1998\u201399 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]], Newman re-signed with the [[1998\u201399 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]], Garrett was traded along with rookie [[Bobby Jackson (basketball)|Bobby Jackson]] back to the [[1998\u201399 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]], and top draft pick [[Tony Battie]] was dealt to the [[1998\u201399 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], who then traded him to the [[1998\u201399 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] several months later.\n\nIn his 2007 study ''The NBA from Top to Bottom'', basketball enthusiast [[Kyle Wright]] argued that in fact the 1997\u201398 Nuggets were a worse team than the 1972\u201373 76ers, saying that they played a worse schedule in the Midwest Division than the 1972\u201373 76ers did in their [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] where [[1972\u201373 Boston Celtics season|a dominant Boston Celtics team]] was played seven times by the 76ers.<ref>Wright, Kyle; ''The NBA from Top to Bottom: A History of the NBA from the No. 1 Team to the No. 1,153''; pp. 80-87. {{ISBN|9780595697960}}</ref> In contrast, Wright says, \"the Nuggets got to play [[1997\u201398 Utah Jazz season|the 62\u201320 Utah Jazz]] only four times\".\n\n==Draft picks==\n{{main|1997 NBA Draft}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#002147;color:#C39953;\" width=\"7%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#002147;color:#C39953;\" width=\"7%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#002147;color:#C39953;\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#002147;color:#C39953;\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#002147;color:#C39953;\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality \n! style=\"background:#002147;color:#C39953;\" width=\"20%\"| School/Club Team\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1 || 5 || [[Tony Battie]] || PF/C || {{flagu|United States}} || Texas Tech\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 33 || [[James Cotton (basketball)|James Cotton]] || SG || {{flagu|United States}} || Long Beach State\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 42 || [[Jason Lawson]] || C || {{flagu|United States}} || Villanova\n|}\n\n==Roster==\n{{NBA roster header|team=Denver Nuggets\n| bg1 = #002147 | color1 = #C39953\n| bg2 = #990000 | color2 = #FFFFFF\n}}\n<!-- begin player list -->\n{{player2 | num = 7 | first = Cory | last = Alexander | pos = PG | ft = 6 | in = 1 | lbs = 185 | college = Virginia | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 4 | first = Tony | last = Battie | pos = PF | ft = 6 | in = 11 | lbs = 230 | college = Texas Tech | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 3 | first = Harold | last = Ellis | dab = basketball | pos = SF | ft = 6 | in = 5 | lbs = 200 | college = [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 20 | first = LaPhonso | last = Ellis | pos = SF | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 240 | college = Notre Dame | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 15 | first = Danny | last = Fortson | pos = PF | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 260 | college = Cincinnati | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 21 | first = Dean | last = Garrett | pos = C | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 225 | college = Indiana | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 5 | first = Anthony | last = Goldwire | pos = PG | ft = 6 | in = 1 | lbs = 182 | college = Houston | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 13 | first = Bobby | last = Jackson | dab = basketball | pos = PG | ft = 6 | in = 1 | lbs = 185 | college = Minnesota | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 30 | first = Priest | last = Lauderdale | pos = C | ft = 7 | in = 4 | lbs = 325 | college = [[Central State University|Central State]] | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 22 | first = Johnny | last = Newman | pos = SF | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 190 | college = Richmond | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 23 | first = Bryant | last = Stith | pos = SG | ft = 6 | in = 5 | lbs = 208 | college = Virginia | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 14 | first = Eric | last = Washington | pos = SG | ft = 6 | in = 4 | lbs = 190 | college = Alabama | nat = USA }}\n{{player2 | num = 32 | first = Eric | last = Williams | dab = basketball, born 1972 | pos = SF | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 220 | college = Providence | nat = USA | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 17 | first = Joe | last = Wolf | pos = C | ft = 6 | in = 11 | lbs = 230 | college = North Carolina | nat = USA | inj = yes }}\n<!-- end player list -->\n{{NBA roster footer\n| head_coach = \n*{{player||USA|[[Bill Hanzlik]]}} ({{college|Notre Dame}})\n| asst_coach =\n*{{player||ITA|[[Mike D'Antoni]]}} ({{college|Marshall}})\n*{{player||USA|[[T.

However, Williams only played just four games due to a knee injury.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, but generally, most episodes feature four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience and panelists voting for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask to reveal their identity. This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain, and one is declared the winner after they perform again.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* '''atime''', '''mtime''': all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* '''path''': path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''linkpath''': symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''uname''', '''gname''': user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''size''': files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* '''uid''', '''gid''': userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names ([[UTF-8]])\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own tags for POSIX.1-2001 pax.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes, reimplementing star extensions.<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\"> {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* '''atime''', '''mtime''': all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* '''path''': path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''linkpath''': symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''uname''', '''gname''': user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''size''': files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* '''uid''', '''gid''': userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names ([[UTF-8]])\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through a withdrawn POSIX.1e draft.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes,<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\"> {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> reimplementing star extensions. Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

A major focus of Rom\u00e1n's work is the quantification of uncertainty in long-term satellite measurements of the Earth's surface at both moderate and high spatial resolutions. Rom\u00e1n has developed a combination of global quality assessment and validation techniques that include visible, near-infrared, and multi-angular imagery and measurements acquired from in-situ and airborne platforms. His efforts to improve narrowband reflectance anisotropy models to estimate the [[Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function]] (BRDF) of land surfaces have led to major advancements in the estimation of terrestrial essential climate variables routinely used to monitor human activity and natural disturbances from satellite platforms. As a lead member of the [[Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer]] (MODIS) and [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ]] (VIIRS) Land Discipline teams, Rom\u00e1n's research has enabled scientists to quantify how much of the variations in satellite observations are due to sensor performance, terrain, and/or geometry (view angle) effects; a critical factor when the satellite data are used to drive policy related to [[Climate change|global climate change]]. Most recently, Dr. Rom\u00e1n's research has focused on capturing seasonal variations in nighttime lights using measurements from the [[VIIRS]] Day/Night Band on [[Suomi NPP|Suomi-NPP]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/satellite-sees-holiday-lights-brighten-cities/ |title=Satellite Sees Holiday Lights Brighten Cities |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==[[Monserrate Roman]]==\n[[Image:Monserrate Roman.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Monserrate Roman]]\n\"Chief Microbiologist\"\n'''Micro-Biologist''' at Marshall Flight Space Center in [[Alabama]].\n\nRoman is the Chief Microbiologist for the Environmental Control and Life Support System project.

His father died when he was very young, and he obtained admittance behind the scenes at Drury-lane, through the influence of a playmate, the son of Phillemore (John Phillemore), one of the performers. Having determined to be an actor, he stuck to the point, as ([[George Colman the Younger|George]]) Colman (the younger) says, \"like a rusty weather-cock\", and we suppose , like most of our heroes, ran away. He commenced acting at a place called [[Waltham Abbey]]\u2026 [he was] Short and thin, yet appearing broad; muscular yet meagre; a large head, with stiff, stubborn, carroty hair; long, colourless face, prominent hooked nose, projecting large hazel eyes, thin lips, and large mouth, which could be twisted into a variety of expression, and which, combining with his other features, eminently served the purposes of the comic muse - such was [his] physiognomy...'<ref name=Biog/><ref>[[William Dunlap|Dunlap, William]], ''A History of the American Theatre'', J. & J.

On 8 June 1798 he was among nine provincial actors who appeared in a benefit for five of them. Twaits played Glenalvon in ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' and Tom Tug in ''The Waterman'' and also sang between the acts. On 17 May 1799 Twaits and some of the actors from June 1789 were back at Wheatley's in Greenwich where they performed ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (during which Twaits as [[Tony Lumpkin]] sang \"a song in character\") and ''[[The Agreeable Surprise]]''.
