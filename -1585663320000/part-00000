Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|230929}}.\n\nBuilt in the mid-17th century as a fortress of the Polish [[Potocki family]], Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w was annexed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, after which it became the property of the State within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The fortress was slowly transformed into one of the most prominent cities at the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. After [[World War I]], for several months, it served as a temporary capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Following [[Peace of Riga]], Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] at the onset of [[World War II]], the city was [[Soviet annexation of the western Ukrainian territories|annexed]] by the Soviet Union, only to be occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] two years later. With the liberation of Soviet Ukraine in 1944 and the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|shifting of borders]], the Communist regime ran the city for the next four-and-a-half decades. A few years before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the blue-yellow flag was raised in the city as the symbol of an independent Ukraine.\n\nA city visitor may find elements of various cultures intertwined within Ivano-Frankivsk, the Polish [[Ratusha (Ivano-Frankivsk)|city hall]], the Austro-Hungarian city's business center, the Soviet [[Panel\u00e1k|prefabricated apartment blocks]] at the city's [[rural\u2013urban fringe]], and others.

In 1939 transliteration changed to Stanislav, in 1941 to Stanislau, in 1944 again to Stanislav.

By 1672, the fortress had been rebuilt from wood to stone, brick, and mortar. Also a new large fortified Potocki palace was erected in the place of an older wood structure.

Most notably, it was home to the football club [[FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk]] (Prykarpattya) that participated on the national level since the 1950s. Since 2007, the club only fields its youth team Spartak-93 and competes in the Children-Youth Football League of Ukraine. The former president of Spartak Anatoliy Revutskiy reorganized the local university ([[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|University of Oil and Gas]]) team in 2007 into the new \"[[FSC Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk|FSK Prykarpattia]]\" with support of the city mayor Anushkevychus making it the main football club in the region and replacing Spartak. Previously during the interbellum period, the city was home to another football club based on the local Polish garrison and called [[Rewera Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w]] (1908). That club competed at a regional level that had evolved at that period. With the start of [[World War II]], that club was disbanded. During the Soviet period among several others there was another club \"Elektron\" that successfully participated at a regional level around the 1970s.\n\nThe city also is the home to a [[futsal]] team, [[Urahan Ivano-Frankivsk|PFC Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk]], that competes in the [[Ukrainian Futsal Championship]]. They were the Ukrainian champions having won the 2010/11 season playoffs and therefore took part in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Futsal Cup]] for the first time.\n\nThe city had an ice hockey team, [[Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk|HC Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk]], which previously played in the [[Ukrainian Hockey Championship]].\n\nIvano-Frankivsk is also the hometown of Ukrainian gymnasts; one of them is Dariya Zgoba who won gold on the uneven bars in the 2007 European Championships and became a finalist on the Beijing Olympics; the other one is [[Yana Demyanchuk]], who won gold on the [[balance beam]] at the 2009 European Championships.\n\nOther clubs include:\n* [[BC Hoverla|Hoverla Ivano-Frankivsk]] (basketball)\n* [[Roland Ivano-Frankivsk]] (rugby)\n* [[Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk|Uragan]] (futsal)\n\n; Main Stadiums and Sport Complexes\n* [[MCS Rukh]], a sport complex consisting of the major arena and two auxiliary fields next to it\n* [[Yunist Stadium (Ivano-Frankivsk)|Yunist Stadium]] (Youth)\n* Hirka Stadium, property of the Ivano-Frankivsk Locomotive Maintenance Plant\n* Nauka Stadium (Science), which belongs to Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University\n* Stadium of Oil and Gas University\n* Sport-Recreational Center \"Tsunami\", which contains an ice arena for the local hockey events and a [[waterpark]]<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://cunami.com.ua/ Tsunami main website]</ref>\n\n==City's radio, television, press media==\n; Press\n* ''\"Reporter\"'' \u2013 Ivano-Frankivsk weekly<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.report.if.ua/|title=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\" \u2013 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d \"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\"|first=|last=Reporter|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''\"Halytsky Korrespondent\"'' \u2013 a social-political weekly<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gk-press.if.ua/|title=\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''\"Halychyna\"'' \u2013 regional newspaper<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galychyna.if.ua/index.php?id=home|title=\u0406\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442-\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0438 \"\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\": \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|author=|date=|work=galychyna.if.ua}}</ref>\n; Radio\n* ''\"Zakhidny Polyus (104.3 FM)\"'' \u2013 city's radio<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110114053959/http://1043.com.ua/index 1043.com.ua]</ref>\n* ''\"Vezha (107 FM)\"'' \u2013 city's radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vezha.org/|title=\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u044f \"\u0412\u0415\u0416\u0410\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n; Television\n* ''\"Ivano-Frankivsk ODTRK\"'' \u2013 regional state broadcasting company<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odtrk.if.ua/|title=\u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u0414\u0422\u0420\u041a \"\u041a\u0410\u0420\u041f\u0410\u0422\u0418\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''\"3-Studia\"'' \u2013 regional broadcasting company<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studio3.com.ua/|title=\u0411\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \"Studio-3\"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026202002/http://www.studio3.com.ua/|archivedate=2011-10-26}}</ref>\n* ''\"Halychyna\"'' \u2013 regional television<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galtv.if.ua/|title=\u041e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0431-\u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \"\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\": \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u043d\u043a\u0430|author=|date=|work=galtv.if.ua}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical list -->\n[[File:DanielAuster22.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Auster]]]]\n[[File:ArthurBurns USArmyPhoto 1955.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Arthur Frank Burns|Arthur F.

|accessdate=March 7, 2010 }}</ref> It is the [[administrative centre]] of [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]. Administratively, it is designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]] within the [[oblast]], and together with a number of rural localities, is incorporated as [[Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|230929}}.\n\nBuilt in the mid-17th century as a fortress of the Polish [[Potocki family]], Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w was annexed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, after which it became the property of the State within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The fortress was slowly transformed into one of the most prominent cities at the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. After [[World War I]], for several months, it served as a temporary capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Following [[Peace of Riga]], Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] at the onset of [[World War II]], the city was [[Soviet annexation of the western Ukrainian territories|annexed]] by the Soviet Union, only to be occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] two years later.

Most notably, it was home to the football club [[FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk]] (Prykarpattya) that participated on the national level since the 1950s. Since 2007, the club only fields its youth team Spartak-93 and competes in the Children-Youth Football League of Ukraine. The former president of Spartak Anatoliy Revutskiy reorganized the local university ([[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|University of Oil and Gas]]) team in 2007 into the new \"[[FSC Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk|FSK Prykarpattia]]\" with support of the city mayor Anushkevychus making it the main football club in the region and replacing Spartak. Previously during the interbellum period, the city was home to another football club based on the local Polish garrison and called [[Rewera Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w]] (1908). That club competed at a regional level that had evolved at that period. With the start of [[World War II]], that club was disbanded. During the Soviet period among several others there was another club \"Elektron\" that successfully participated at a regional level around the 1970s.\n\nThe city also is the home to a [[futsal]] team, [[Urahan Ivano-Frankivsk|PFC Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk]], that competes in the [[Ukrainian Futsal Championship]]. They were the Ukrainian champions having won the 2010/11 season playoffs and therefore took part in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Futsal Cup]] for the first time.\n\nThe city had an ice hockey team, [[Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk|HC Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk]], which previously played in the [[Ukrainian Hockey Championship]].\n\nIvano-Frankivsk is also the hometown of Ukrainian gymnasts; one of them is Dariya Zgoba who won gold on the uneven bars in the 2007 European Championships and became a finalist on the Beijing Olympics; the other one is [[Yana Demyanchuk]], who won gold on the [[balance beam]] at the 2009 European Championships.\n\nOther clubs include:\n* [[BC Hoverla|Hoverla Ivano-Frankivsk]] (basketball)\n* [[Roland Ivano-Frankivsk]] (rugby)\n* [[Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk|Uragan]] (futsal)\n\n; Main Stadiums and Sport Complexes\n* [[MCS Rukh]], a sport complex consisting of the major arena and two auxiliary fields next to it\n* [[Yunist Stadium (Ivano-Frankivsk)|Yunist Stadium]] (Youth)\n* Hirka Stadium, property of the Ivano-Frankivsk Locomotive Maintenance Plant\n* Nauka Stadium (Science), which belongs to Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University\n* Stadium of Oil and Gas University\n* Sport-Recreational Center \"Tsunami\", which contains an ice arena for the local hockey events and a [[waterpark]]<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://cunami.com.ua/ Tsunami main website]</ref>\n\n==City's radio, television, press media==\n; Press\n* ''\"Reporter\"'' \u2013 Ivano-Frankivsk weekly<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.report.if.ua/|title=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\" \u2013 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d \"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\"|first=|last=Reporter|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''\"Halytsky Korrespondent\"'' \u2013 a social-political weekly<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gk-press.if.ua/|title=\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''\"Halychyna\"'' \u2013 regional newspaper<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galychyna.if.ua/index.php?id=home|title=\u0406\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442-\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0438 \"\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\": \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|author=|date=|work=galychyna.if.ua}}</ref>\n; Radio\n* ''\"Zakhidny Polyus (104.3 FM)\"'' \u2013 city's radio<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110114053959/http://1043.com.ua/index 1043.com.ua]</ref>\n* ''\"Vezha (107 FM)\"'' \u2013 city's radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vezha.org/|title=\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u044f \"\u0412\u0415\u0416\u0410\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n; Television\n* ''\"Ivano-Frankivsk ODTRK\"'' \u2013 regional state broadcasting company<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odtrk.if.ua/|title=\u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u0414\u0422\u0420\u041a \"\u041a\u0410\u0420\u041f\u0410\u0422\u0418\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''\"3-Studia\"'' \u2013 regional broadcasting company<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studio3.com.ua/|title=\u0411\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \"Studio-3\"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026202002/http://www.studio3.com.ua/|archivedate=2011-10-26}}</ref>\n* ''\"Halychyna\"'' \u2013 regional television<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galtv.if.ua/|title=\u041e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0431-\u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \"\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\": \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u043d\u043a\u0430|author=|date=|work=galtv.if.ua}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical list -->\n[[File:DanielAuster22.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Auster]]]]\n[[File:ArthurBurns USArmyPhoto 1955.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Arthur Frank Burns|Arthur F.

Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while [[terrestrial crab|terrestrial]] and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as [[fiddler crab]] males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have [[internal fertilisation]] and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the [[sperm]] for a long time before using it to fertilise their [[ovum|eggs]]. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries.\n\nWhen development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched [[crustacean larvae|larvae]] into the water, where they are part of the [[plankton]]. The release is often timed with the [[tide]]s. The free-swimming tiny [[Zoea|zoea larvae]] can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk.\n[[File:Xantho poressa 2009 G1.jpg|thumb|right|Female crab ''[[Xantho poressa]]'' at spawning time in the [[Black Sea]], carrying eggs under her abdomen]]\n[[File:Grapsus tenuicrustatus - hawaii - 2015-11-01.webm|thumb|right|A [[grapsus|Grapsus tenuicrustatus]] climbing up a rock in [[Hawaii]]]]\n\nEach species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by [[Ecdysis|moults]], before they change into a [[megalopa]] stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.<ref name=\"Weis\">{{cite book |author=Judith S. Weis |year=2012 |title=Walking Sideways: The Remarkable World of Crabs |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-0-8014-5050-1 |oclc=794640315}}</ref>{{rp|63\u201377}}\n\nMost species of terrestrial crabs must [[Animal migration|migrate]] down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable [[roadkill]] of migrating crabs.<ref name=\"Weis\"/>{{rp|113\u2013114}}\n\nOnce crabs have become juveniles, they will still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by [[hormone]]s. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the [[carapace]]. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, [[Arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]], [[eyestalk]]s, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an [[exuvia]]), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.<ref name=\"Weis\" />{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Carpilius convexus is consuming Heterocentrotus trigonarius in Hawaii.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Carpilius convexus]]'' consuming ''[[Heterocentrotus trigonarius]]'' in Hawaii]]\nCrabs typically walk sideways<ref name=\"Sleinis\">{{cite journal |title=Locomotion in a forward walking crab |author1=Sally Sleinis |author2=Gerald E.

Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as [[soft-shell crab]]; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the [[snow crab]]. In many cultures the [[roe]] of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and northern European cultures, as well as on the eastern, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and southern coasts of the United States.\n\nIn some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indosphere]], [[spice mix|masala]] crab and [[chilli crab]] are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, blue crab is often steamed with [[Old Bay Seasoning]]. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter.\n\nFor the British dish [[Cancer pagurus#Cookery|dressed crab]], the [[crab meat]] is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise or mustard, creating a [[crab cake]].  Crabs can also be made into a [[bisque (food)|bisque]], a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made.\n\n[[Crab stick|Imitation crab]], also called [[surimi]], is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.<ref name=\"New York Times\">Daniel P.

Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while [[terrestrial crab|terrestrial]] and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as [[fiddler crab]] males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have [[internal fertilisation]] and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the [[sperm]] for a long time before using it to fertilise their [[ovum|eggs]]. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries.\n\nWhen development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched [[crustacean larvae|larvae]] into the water, where they are part of the [[plankton]]. The release is often timed with the [[tide]]s. The free-swimming tiny [[Zoea|zoea larvae]] can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk.\n[[File:Xantho poressa 2009 G1.jpg|thumb|right|Female crab ''[[Xantho poressa]]'' at spawning time in the [[Black Sea]], carrying eggs under her abdomen]]\n[[File:Grapsus tenuicrustatus - hawaii - 2015-11-01.webm|thumb|right|A [[grapsus|Grapsus tenuicrustatus]] climbing up a rock in [[Hawaii]]]]\n\nEach species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by [[Ecdysis|moults]], before they change into a [[megalopa]] stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.<ref name=\"Weis\">{{cite book |author=Judith S. Weis |year=2012 |title=Walking Sideways: The Remarkable World of Crabs |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-0-8014-5050-1 |oclc=794640315}}</ref>{{rp|63\u201377}}\n\nMost species of terrestrial crabs must [[Animal migration|migrate]] down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable [[roadkill]] of migrating crabs.<ref name=\"Weis\"/>{{rp|113\u2013114}}\n\nOnce crabs have become juveniles, they will still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by [[hormone]]s. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the [[carapace]]. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, [[Arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]], [[eyestalk]]s, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an [[exuvia]]), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.<ref name=\"Weis\" />{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Carpilius convexus is consuming Heterocentrotus trigonarius in Hawaii.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Carpilius convexus]]'' consuming ''[[Heterocentrotus trigonarius]]'' in Hawaii]]\nCrabs typically walk sideways<ref name=\"Sleinis\">{{cite journal |title=Locomotion in a forward walking crab |author1=Sally Sleinis |author2=Gerald E.

Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as [[soft-shell crab]]; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the [[snow crab]]. In many cultures the [[roe]] of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and northern European cultures, as well as on the eastern, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and southern coasts of the United States.\n\nIn some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indosphere]], [[spice mix|masala]] crab and [[chilli crab]] are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, blue crab is often steamed with [[Old Bay Seasoning]]. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter.\n\nFor the British dish [[Cancer pagurus#Cookery|dressed crab]], the [[crab meat]] is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise or mustard, creating a [[crab cake]].  Crabs can also be made into a [[bisque (food)|bisque]], a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made.\n\n[[Crab stick|Imitation crab]], also called [[surimi]], is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.<ref name=\"New York Times\">Daniel P.

Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, [[carcinisation]] is most advanced in crabs. The [[telson]] is no longer functional in crabs, and the [[uropod]]s are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the [[Sternum (arthropod)|sternum]].\n\nIn most decapods, the [[gonopore]]s (sexual openings) are found on the legs. However, since crabs use the first two pairs of [[pleopod]]s (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved towards the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=M. de Saint Laurent |year=1980 |title=Sur la classification et la phylog\u00e9nie des Crustac\u00e9s D\u00e9capodes Brachyoures.

In 2004, Otsego County voted 51\u201348 percent in favor of [[George W. Bush]]. In 2008 and 2012, Otsego County voted in favor of [[Barack Obama]]. Democrats are prevalent in the City of Oneonta and Village of Cooperstown, whereas the majority of voters in many of the surrounding towns are registered Republicans.\n\nOtsego County is the only county in New York that names its legislative body the Board of Representatives. It consists of fourteen members elected from  [[single-member district]]s. The Board Chair is David Bliss (R). The county also has an elected District Attorney, County Treasurer, County Clerk, and County Sheriff.\n\n== Media ==\nAlong with [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] and the eastern portion of [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], Otsego County is considered part of the [[Utica, New York|Utica]] television market.<ref>{{Cite web|title = WKTV.com {{!}} WKTV bringing CBS affiliation to Utica|url = http://www.wktv.com/news/WKTV_bringing_CBS_affiliation_to_Utica.html|website = WKTV.com|date = 2015-10-26|accessdate = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027135050/http://www.wktv.com/news/WKTV_bringing_CBS_affiliation_to_Utica.html|archivedate = 2015-10-27}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe Village of Cooperstown (home of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], whose father William Cooper founded it) is located at the south end of [[Otsego Lake (New York)|Otsego Lake]]. It attracts many tourists to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] and the [[New York State Historical Association]] museums. Cultural attractions also include the [[Glimmerglass Opera]], with a summer season that draws many repeat visitors for stays.\n\nThe primary contributor to the economy is healthcare: Bassett Medical Center, the headquarters of Bassett Healthcare Network and its more than 3,000 employees, is located here.\n\nThe City of [[Oneonta, New York|Oneonta]] has two institutions of higher education: [[Hartwick College]] and the [[State University of New York at Oneonta]]; A.O. Fox Memorial Hospital, an affiliate of the Bassett Network; major retail activity; and numerous small businesses.  The county as a whole remains relatively rural, with dairy farming a contributing industry that has consolidated employment in recent years, although production has remained steady.\n\n==Communities==\n[[Image:Map of Otsego County NY Bacon's History 1902.jpg|right|350px|Map of Otsego County NY to accompany Bacon's History 1902]]\n\n===City===\n* [[Oneonta, New York|Oneonta]]\n\n===Towns===\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Burlington, New York|Burlington]]\n* [[Butternuts, New York|Butternuts]]\n* [[Cherry Valley (town), New York|Cherry Valley]]\n* [[Decatur, New York|Decatur]]\n* [[Edmeston, New York|Edmeston]]\n* [[Exeter, New York|Exeter]]\n* [[Hartwick, New York|Hartwick]]\n* [[Laurens (town), New York|Laurens]]\n* [[Maryland, New York|Maryland]]\n* [[Middlefield, New York|Middlefield]]\n* [[Milford, New York|Milford]]\n* [[Morris (town), New York|Morris]]\n* [[New Lisbon, New York|New Lisbon]]\n* [[Oneonta (town), New York|Oneonta]]\n* [[Otego (town), New York|Otego]]\n* [[Otsego, New York|Otsego]]\n* [[Pittsfield, New York|Pittsfield]]\n* [[Plainfield, New York|Plainfield]]\n* [[Richfield, New York|Richfield]]\n* [[Roseboom, New York|Roseboom]]\n* [[Springfield, New York|Springfield]]\n* [[Unadilla, New York|Unadilla]]\n* [[Westford, New York|Westford]]\n* [[Worcester, New York|Worcester]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Villages===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cherry Valley (village), New York|Cherry Valley]]\n* [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] (county seat)\n* [[Gilbertsville, New York|Gilbertsville]]\n* [[Laurens (village), New York|Laurens]]\n* [[Milford (village), New York|Milford]]\n* [[Morris (village), New York|Morris]]\n* [[Otego (village), New York|Otego]]\n* [[Richfield Springs, New York|Richfield Springs]]\n* [[Unadilla (village), New York|Unadilla]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Census-designated places===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Burlington Flats, New York|Burlington Flats]]\n* [[East Worcester, New York|East Worcester]]\n* [[Edmeston (CDP), New York|Edmeston]]\n* [[Fly Creek, New York|Fly Creek]]\n* [[Garrattsville, New York|Garrattsville]]\n* [[Hartwick (CDP), New York|Hartwick]]\n* [[Hartwick Seminary, New York|Hartwick Seminary]]\n* [[Mount Vision, New York|Mount Vision]]\n* [[Portlandville, New York|Portlandville]]\n* [[Schenevus, New York|Schenevus]]\n* [[Schuyler Lake, New York|Schuyler Lake]]\n* [[South Edmeston, New York|South Edmeston]]\n* [[Springfield Center, New York|Springfield Center]]\n* [[Unadilla Forks, New York|Unadilla Forks]]\n* [[Wells Bridge, New York|Wells Bridge]]\n* [[West End, New York|West End]]\n* [[Westford, New York|Westford]]\n* [[Worcester (CDP), New York|Worcester]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Hamlets===\n* [[East Springfield, New York|East Springfield]]\n* [[Schuyler Lake, New York|Schuyler Lake]]\n* [[Silver Lake, Otsego County, New York|Silver Lake]]\n* [[West Burlington, New York|West Burlington]]\n* [[West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|New York (state)}}\n* [[List of counties in New York]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Otsego County, New York]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* Butterfield, Lyman H.

The area split off from [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] was much larger than the present county, as it included the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne counties]].\n\n===Formation===\nOtsego County was one of three early counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]] and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]]) after the American Revolutionary War. Otsego County was officially established on February 16, 1791, with [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] as its county seat, although at the time the village of Cherry Valley was much larger.  The original county consisted of three large [[townships]]:\n*[[Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] in the northeast,\n*[[Otsego, New York|Otsego]] in the northwest, and\n*[[Harpersfield, New York|Harpersfield]] in the south.\n\nOtsego and Cherry Valley together roughly covered the area of modern Otsego County, while Harpersfield covered the area south of the current county as far as the [[Delaware River]].\n\nThe original appointments to Otsego County government positions, made by [[George Clinton (vice president)|Governor George Clinton]] included:\n* [[Richard R. Smith]], county sheriff, from Otsego township,\n* [[Jacob Morris]], county clerk, from Otsego township,\n* [[William Cooper (judge)|William Cooper]], chief judge, from Otsego township,\n* [[Jedediah Peck]], associate justice from Otsego township,\n* [[Edward Griswold]], associate justice from Cherry Valley\n* [[Platt Townsend]], associate justice from Harpersfield,\n* Alexander Harper, commander of the county militia, from Harpersfield.\n\n===New towns===\nBy 1793, four towns had been added to the county by division of the existing towns:\n*The Otsego township had been divided into the towns of:\n**[[Burlington, New York|Burlington]] in the west,\n**[[Otsego, New York|Otsego]] in the northeast,\n**[[Richfield, New York|Richfield]] in the north, and\n**[[Unadilla (town), New York|Unadilla]] in the south.\n*Harpersfield had been divided into the towns of:\n**[[Franklin (town), New York|Franklin]] in the west and\n**[[Harpersfield, New York|Harpersfield]] in the east.\n\nIn 1795, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] to create [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]].\n\nIn 1797, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] to create [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1016|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1002|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|14|sqmi}} (1.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOtsego County is in central New York State, to the west of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], southeast of [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and northeast of [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]].
