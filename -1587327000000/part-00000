An example in English is the vowel sound of the \"a\" in the word ''about''. Schwa in English is mainly found in [[unstressed vowel|unstressed]] positions, but in some other languages it occurs more frequently as a stressed vowel.\n\nIn relation to certain languages, the name \"schwa\" and the symbol {{IPA|\u0259}} may be used for some other [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] and [[tone (linguistics)|toneless]] '''neutral vowel''', not necessarily mid-central.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''schwa'' is from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''{{transl|he|[[shva]]}}'' ({{lang|he|\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d5\u05b8\u05d0}}&nbsp; {{IPA-he|\u0283va|IPA}}, <small>classical pronunciation:</small> ''{{transl|he|sh\u0259w\u0101\u02bc}}''&nbsp; {{IPA-he|\u0283\u0259\u02d1w\u0252\u02d0\u0294|}}), the name of [[niqqud]] sign used to indicate the phoneme.\n\nThe term was introduced by German linguists in the 19th century, and so the spelling ''sch'' is [[German language|German]] in origin. It was first used in English texts between 1890 and 1895.<ref>{{Dictionary.com|schwa}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|schwa}}</ref>\n\nThe symbol {{angle bracket|\u0259}} was used first by [[Johann Andreas Schmeller]] for the reduced vowel at the end of the German name ''Gabe''. [[Alexander John Ellis]], in his ''pal\u00e6otype alphabet'', used it for the similar English sound in ''but'' {{IPAc-en|b|V|t}}.\n\nThe symbol {{angle bracket|\u0259}} was a modified form of [[Greek letter]] [[theta|\u03b8]] (''theta'').{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Description==\n{{Main|Epenthesis|Unstressed vowel|Vowel reduction}}\nSometimes the term \"schwa\" is used for any [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowel]], but some languages use different epenthetic vowels ([[Navajo language|Navajo]] uses {{IPA|[i]}}).\n\nIn [[English language|English]], schwa is the most common [[vowel]] sound.<ref>Rachael-Anne Knight(2012), Phonetics: A course book, Cambridge University Press, p.71.</ref> It is a [[reduced vowel]] in many unstressed [[syllable]]s especially if [[syllabic consonant]]s are not used. Depending on dialect, it may be written using any of the following letters:\n\n*'a', as in ''about'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8ba\u028at]}}\n*'e', as in ''taken'' {{IPA|[\u02c8t\u02b0e\u026ak\u0259n]}}\n*'i', as in ''pencil'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u02b0\u025bns\u0259l]}}\n*'o', as in ''memory'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u025bm\u0259ri]}}\n*'u', as in ''supply'' {{IPA|[s\u0259\u02c8pla\u026a]}}\n*'y', as in ''sibyl'' {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ab\u0259l]}}\n*unwritten, as in ''rhythm'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u026a\u00f0\u0259m]}}\n\nSchwa is a very [[vowel length|short]] neutral vowel sound, and like all other vowels, its precise quality varies depending on the adjacent [[consonants]]. In most varieties of English, schwa occurs almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. (There is also an [[open-mid central unrounded vowel]] or \"long schwa\", represented as {{IPA|\u025c\u02d0}}, which occurs in some [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] dialect stressed syllables, as in ''bird'' and ''alert''.)\n\nIn [[New Zealand English]], the high front lax vowel (as in the word ''bit'' {{IPAc-en|'|b|I|t}}) has [[Vowel shift|shifted]] open and back to sound like schwa, and both stressed and unstressed schwas exist. To a certain extent, that is true for [[South African English]] as well.\n\nIn [[General American]], schwa and {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} are the two vowel sounds that can be [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] (rhotacized); r-colored schwa is used in words with unstressed \"er\" syllables, such as ''dinner''. See also [[stress and vowel reduction in English]].\n\n[[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the letter {{angle bracket|y}} to represent schwa, which is a phonemic vowel rather than the realisation of an unstressed vowel. The letter {{angle bracket|y}} represents schwa in all positions except in final syllables where it represents {{IPA|/\u026a/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the word ''ysbyty'' (\"hospital\") is pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259s\u02c8b\u0259ti/}}.\n\nQuite a few languages have a sound similar to schwa. It is similar to a short [[French language|French]] unaccented {{angle bracket|e}}, which is rounded and less central, more like an [[open-mid front rounded vowel|open-mid]] or [[close-mid front rounded vowel]]. It is almost always unstressed, but [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] are some of the languages that allow stressed schwas.\n\nIn most dialects of [[Russian language|Russian]] unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} and {{angle bracket|o}} [[Vowel reduction in Russian#Back vowels|reduce]] to either {{IPA|[[Near-open central vowel|[\u0250]]]}} or schwa. In dialects of [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] a schwa occurs in place of the [[Old Polish language|Old Polish]] short consonants ''u, i, y''.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Breza | first1= Edward | last2= Treder | first2= Jerzy | title= Gramatyka kaszubska | year=1981 | publisher= Zrzeszenie Kaszubsko-Pomorskie | location= Gda\u0144sk | isbn= 83-00-00102-6 | page=16}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] and some [[Uralic languages]] (like [[Komi language|Komi]]) also use phonemic schwa, and allow schwas to be stressed. In the Eastern dialects of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], including the standard variety, based in the dialect spoken in and around [[Barcelona]], an unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} or {{angle bracket|e}} is pronounced as a schwa (called ''\"vocal neutra\"'', 'neutral vowel'). A stressed schwa can occur in the Catalan dialects spoken in the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], as in ''m\u0103tur\u0103'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0259tur\u0259]}} ('broom').\n\nIn [[European Portuguese|European]] and some [[Portuguese language in Africa|African]] dialects of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the schwa occurs in many unstressed syllables that end in {{angle bracket|e}}, such as ''noite'' ('night'), ''tarde'' ('afternoon'), ''p\u00eassego'' ('peach'), and ''pecado'' ('sin'). However, that is rare in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] except in such areas as [[Curitiba]] in [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]]{{cn| date= October 2018}}).\n\nIn [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], a final, unstressed {{angle bracket|a}}, and unstressed {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|o}} are pronounced as a schwa: ''p\u00eczza'' ('pizza'), ''semm\u00e0na'' ('week'), '' purtu\u00e0llo'' ('orange').\n\nThe inherent vowel in the [[Devanagari]] script, an [[abugida]] used to write [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Sanskrit]] is a schwa, written {{angle bracket|\u0905}} either in isolation or word-initially.\n\nOther characters used to represent this sound include {{angle bracket|\u0568}} in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], {{angle bracket|\u0103}} in Romanian, and {{angle bracket|\u00eb}} in Albanian. In Bulgarian [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], the letter {{angle bracket|[[yer|\u044a]]}}, which has a very different orthographic function in Modern Russian, is used.\n\nIn languages such as [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] there is no such sound that would resemble the \"schwa\" characteristics.\n\nIn [[Korean language|Korean]], the letter (or rather [[Hangul#jamo|jamo]]) is used, but it may also represent a \"null\" vowel used in the transcription of foreign consonant clusters, when it may be deleted. In most Sanskrit-based languages, the schwa {{angle bracket|[[devanagari|\u0905]]}} is the implied vowel after every consonant and so has no didactic marks. For example, in Hindi, the character \u0915 is pronounced \"k\u0259\" without marking, but \u0915\u0947 is pronounced \"ke\" (pronounced \"kay\") with a marking.\n\nA subscript small schwa (\u2094) is used in [[Indo-European studies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04191-n2788-laryngeals.pdf|title=L2/04-191: Proposal to encode six Indo-Europeanist phonetic characters in the UCS|date=2004-06-07|first1=Deborah|last1=Anderson|first2=Michael|last2=Everson}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===Albanian===\nIn Albanian, schwa is represented by the letter {{angle bracket|[[\u00eb!]]}}, which is also one of the letters of the [[Albanian alphabet]], coming right after the letter {{angle bracket|[[e]]}}. It can be stressed like in words ''i \u00ebmb\u00ebl'' {{IPA|/i \u0259mb\u0259l/}} and ''\u00ebnd\u00ebrr'' {{IPA|/\u0259nd\u0259r/}} ('sweet' and 'dream', respectively).\n\n===Armenian===\nIn Armenian, schwa is represented by the letter '''\u0568''' (capital '''\u0538'''). It is occasionally word-initial but usually word-final, as a form of the definite article. Unwritten schwa sounds are also inserted to split initial consonant clusters; for example, \u0573\u0576\u0573\u0572\u0578\u0582\u056f (''\u010dn\u010d\u0142uk'') [t\u0283\u02bc\u0259nt\u0283\u02bc\u0259'\u0281uk] 'sparrow'.\n\n===Azerbaijani===\nIn the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]], the schwa character '''\u0259''' is used, but to represent the '''[[Near-open_front_unrounded_vowel|\u00e6]]''' sound.\n\n===Catalan===\nIn Catalan, schwa is represented by the letters '''a''' or '''e''' in unstressed vowels: \"par'''e'''\" {{IPA|/\u02c8pa\u027e'''\u0259'''/}} (''father''), \"B'''a'''rc'''e'''lon'''a'''\" {{IPA|/b\u0259\u027es\u0259\u02c8lon\u0259/}}. In the Balearic Islands, the sound is sometimes also in stressed vowels, \"p'''e'''r'''a'''\" {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u0259\u027e\u0259/}} (''pear'').\n\n===Dutch===\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the digraph {{angle bracket|ij}} in the suffix ''-lijk'' {{IPA-nl|l\u0259k|}}, as in ''waarschijnlijk'' {{IPA-nl|\u028ba\u02d0r\u02c8sx\u025binl\u0259k|}} ('probably') is pronounced as a schwa. If an {{angle bracket|e}} falls at the ultimate (or penultimate) place before a consonant in Dutch words and is unstressed, it becomes a schwa, as in the verb ending \"-en\" (''lopen'') and the diminutive suffix \"-tje(s)\" (''tafeltje(s)'').\n\n===Korean===\nThe schwa is rarely used in [[Korean phonology]]. It is an alternative form of \u028c. For example, \ud638\ub5a1 (''[[hotteok]]'') [ho.t\u0348\u0259k\u031a].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Madurese ===\nIn [[Madurese language|Madurese]], some words with /a/, usually in nonfinal position, would be pronounced as the schwa. When writing Madurese in its traditional [[abugida]], [[Javanese script|Hanacaraka]], words as such would not be written with a vowel diacritic that denote that it is a schwa. Nowadays, even after the [[Madurese people]] have adopted the [[Latin alphabet]], such writing fashion is still used. \n\nExample -\n\n* \"Jhabah\" (/d\u0292\u0259b\u0259h/) - [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Java Island]]\n* \"sagara\" (/sag\u0259r\u0259/) - sea,ocean\n* \"lajar\" (/l\u0259d\u0292\u0259r/) - to sail\n* \"Sorbaja\" (/sorb\u0259d\u0292\u0259/) - [[Surabaya]]\n* \"Madura\" (/madur\u0259/) - [[Madurese people|Madurese]], [[Madura Island]]\n* \"Bulan\" (/bul\u0259n/) - [[Moon]]\n\n===Malay===\nIn the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] variant, schwa is always unstressed except for [[Jakarta]]-influenced informal Indonesian whose schwa can be stressed. In final closed syllables in the formal register, the vowel is ''a'' (the final syllable is usually the second syllable since most Indonesian root words consist of two syllables). In some cases, the vowel ''a'' is pronounced as a stressed schwa (only when the vowel ''a'' is located between two consonants in a syllable), but never in formal speech:\n\n*datang (=come), pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0251\u02d0\u02c8t\u028c\u014b]}}, and often written as ''dateng'' in informal writing.\n*kental (=viscous), pronounced {{IPA|[k\u0259n\u02c8t\u028cl]}}.\n*hitam (=black), pronounced {{IPA|[hi\u02c8t\u028cm]}}, written as ''item'' in informal language.\n*dalam (=deep, in), pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0251\u02d0\u02c8l\u028cm]}}, often written as ''dalem''.\n*malam (=night), pronounced {{IPA|[m\u028c\u02c8l\u028cm]}}, written as ''malem'' in informal language.\n\nIndonesian orthography formerly used unmarked {{angle bracket|e}} only for the schwa sound, and the full vowel /e/ was written {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}. Malaysian orthography, on the other hand, formerly indicated the schwa with {{angle bracket|\u0115}} (called ''p\u0115p\u0115t''), and unmarked {{angle bracket|e}} stood for /e/.\n\nIn the 1972 spelling reform that unified Indonesian and Malaysian spelling conventions (''[[Differences between Malay and Indonesian#Orthography|Ejaan yang Disempurnakan]]'', regulated by [[Majlis Bahasa Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia|MABBIM]]), it was agreed to use neither diacritic.<ref>Asmah Haji Omar, {{cite journal|year=1989|title=The Malay Spelling Reform|url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j11/malay.php|url-status=dead|journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society|issue=2|pages=9\u201313|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706054017/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j11/malay.php|archivedate=2010-07-06}}</ref> There is no longer an orthographic distinction between /\u0259/ and /e/; both are spelled with an unmarked {{angle bracket|e}}. This means that the pronunciation of any given letter ''e'' in both Indonesian and Malaysian variants is not immediately obvious to the learner and must be learned separately. However, in a number of Indonesian dictionaries and lesson books for foreign learners, the notation is preserved to help learners. For example, the word for 'wheeled vehicle' in Indonesia and Malaysia, which was formerly spelled ''ker\u00e9ta'' in Indonesia and ''k\u0115reta'' in Malaysia, is now spelled ''kereta'' in both countries.\n\nIn Southern Malaysian pronunciation, which is predominant in common Malaysian media, the final letter -''a'' represents schwa, and final ''-ah'' stands for  /a/. The dialect of [[Kedah]] in northern Malaysia, however, pronounces final -''a'' as /a/ also. In loanwords, a nonfinal short /a/ may become schwa in Malay such as ''Mekah'' (<Arabic ''[[Mecca|Makkah]]'', Malay pronunciation {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0259kah]}}).\n\n=== Norwegian ===\nIn Norwegian, the schwa is often found in the last syllable of definite, masculine nouns, as in ''mannen'' {{IPA-no|'m\u0251n\u0259n}} ('the man'), as well as in infinitive verbs like ''bite'' {{IPA-no|\u02c8b\u00ee\u02d0t\u0259}} ('bite').\n\n===Romanian===\nIn Romanian, schwa is represented by the letter [[\u0102]], [[\u0103]], which is considered a letter on its own (the second in the [[Romanian alphabet]]). It can be stressed in words in which it is the only vowel such as \"p\u0103r\" {{IPA|/p\u0259r/}} (''hair'' or ''pear tree'') or \"v\u0103d\" {{IPA|/v\u0259d/}} (''I see''). Some words which also contain other vowels can have the stress on '''\u0103''': \"c\u0103r\u021bile\" {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u0259rt\u0361sile/}} (''the books'') and \"od\u0103i\" {{IPA|/o\u02c8d\u0259j/}} (''rooms'').\n\n=== Serbo-Croatian ===\nIn [[Serbo-Croatian]], schwa is not a phoneme, but it is often colloquially used to pronounce names of consonants. For example, the official name of the letter {{Angle bracket|p}} is pronounced {{IPA|/pe(\u02d0)/}}, but in everyday speech, it is often called {{IPA|/p\u0259/}}.\n\n===Welsh===\nThe schwa is denoted in Welsh by the letter 'y'. It is a very common letter as 'y' is the definite article with 'yr' being the definite article if the following word starts with a vowel.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n==Schwa syncope==\n{{main|Syncope (phonology)}}In phonology, [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] is the process of deleting unstressed sounds, particularly unstressed vowels. Across languages, schwa vowels are commonly deleted in some instances, such as in [[Hindi]], [[North American English]], and [[French language|French]].\n\n===Hindi===\n{{Main|Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages}}\nAlthough the [[Devanagari]] script is used as a standard to write Modern Hindi, the schwa (''\u0259'', sometimes written as ''a'') implicit in each consonant of the script is \"obligatorily deleted\" at the end of words and in certain other contexts.<ref name=\"hyman1988\">{{Citation |title = Language, speech, and mind (Volume 1988, Part 2)|author1=Larry M.

An example in English is the vowel sound of the \"a\" in the word ''about''. Schwa in English is mainly found in [[unstressed vowel|unstressed]] positions, but in some other languages it occurs more frequently as a stressed vowel.\n\nIn relation to certain languages, the name \"schwa\" and the symbol {{IPA|\u0259}} may be used for some other [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] and [[tone (linguistics)|toneless]] '''neutral vowel''', not necessarily mid-central.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''schwa'' is from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''{{transl|he|[[shva]]}}'' ({{lang|he|\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d5\u05b8\u05d0}}&nbsp; {{IPA-he|\u0283va|IPA}}, <small>classical pronunciation:</small> ''{{transl|he|sh\u0259w\u0101\u02bc}}''&nbsp; {{IPA-he|\u0283\u0259\u02d1w\u0252\u02d0\u0294|}}), the name of [[niqqud]] sign used to indicate the phoneme.\n\nThe term was introduced by German linguists in the 19th century, and so the spelling ''sch'' is [[German language|German]] in origin. It was first used in English texts between 1890 and 1895.<ref>{{Dictionary.com|schwa}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|schwa}}</ref>\n\nThe symbol {{angle bracket|\u0259}} was used first by [[Johann Andreas Schmeller]] for the reduced vowel at the end of the German name ''Gabe''. [[Alexander John Ellis]], in his ''pal\u00e6otype alphabet'', used it for the similar English sound in ''but'' {{IPAc-en|b|V|t}}.\n\nThe symbol {{angle bracket|\u0259}} was a modified form of [[Greek letter]] [[theta|\u03b8]] (''theta'').{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Description==\n{{Main|Epenthesis|Unstressed vowel|Vowel reduction}}\nSometimes the term \"schwa\" is used for any [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowel]], but some languages use different epenthetic vowels ([[Navajo language|Navajo]] uses {{IPA|[i]}}).\n\nIn [[English language|English]], schwa is the most common [[vowel]] sound.<ref>Rachael-Anne Knight(2012), Phonetics: A course book, Cambridge University Press, p.71.</ref> It is a [[reduced vowel]] in many unstressed [[syllable]]s especially if [[syllabic consonant]]s are not used. Depending on dialect, it may be written using any of the following letters:\n\n*'a', as in ''about'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8ba\u028at]}}\n*'e', as in ''taken'' {{IPA|[\u02c8t\u02b0e\u026ak\u0259n]}}\n*'i', as in ''pencil'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u02b0\u025bns\u0259l]}}\n*'o', as in ''memory'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u025bm\u0259ri]}}\n*'u', as in ''supply'' {{IPA|[s\u0259\u02c8pla\u026a]}}\n*'y', as in ''sibyl'' {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ab\u0259l]}}\n*unwritten, as in ''rhythm'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u026a\u00f0\u0259m]}}\n\nSchwa is a very [[vowel length|short]] neutral vowel sound, and like all other vowels, its precise quality varies depending on the adjacent [[consonants]]. In most varieties of English, schwa occurs almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. (There is also an [[open-mid central unrounded vowel]] or \"long schwa\", represented as {{IPA|\u025c\u02d0}}, which occurs in some [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] dialect stressed syllables, as in ''bird'' and ''alert''.)\n\nIn [[New Zealand English]], the high front lax vowel (as in the word ''bit'' {{IPAc-en|'|b|I|t}}) has [[Vowel shift|shifted]] open and back to sound like schwa, and both stressed and unstressed schwas exist. To a certain extent, that is true for [[South African English]] as well.\n\nIn [[General American]], schwa and {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} are the two vowel sounds that can be [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] (rhotacized); r-colored schwa is used in words with unstressed \"er\" syllables, such as ''dinner''. See also [[stress and vowel reduction in English]].\n\n[[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the letter {{angle bracket|y}} to represent schwa, which is a phonemic vowel rather than the realisation of an unstressed vowel. The letter {{angle bracket|y}} represents schwa in all positions except in final syllables where it represents {{IPA|/\u026a/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the word ''ysbyty'' (\"hospital\") is pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259s\u02c8b\u0259ti/}}.\n\nQuite a few languages have a sound similar to schwa. It is similar to a short [[French language|French]] unaccented {{angle bracket|e}}, which is rounded and less central, more like an [[open-mid front rounded vowel|open-mid]] or [[close-mid front rounded vowel]]. It is almost always unstressed, but [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] are some of the languages that allow stressed schwas.\n\nIn most dialects of [[Russian language|Russian]] unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} and {{angle bracket|o}} [[Vowel reduction in Russian#Back vowels|reduce]] to either {{IPA|[[Near-open central vowel|[\u0250]]]}} or schwa. In dialects of [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] a schwa occurs in place of the [[Old Polish language|Old Polish]] short consonants ''u, i, y''.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Breza | first1= Edward | last2= Treder | first2= Jerzy | title= Gramatyka kaszubska | year=1981 | publisher= Zrzeszenie Kaszubsko-Pomorskie | location= Gda\u0144sk | isbn= 83-00-00102-6 | page=16}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] and some [[Uralic languages]] (like [[Komi language|Komi]]) also use phonemic schwa, and allow schwas to be stressed. In the Eastern dialects of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], including the standard variety, based in the dialect spoken in and around [[Barcelona]], an unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} or {{angle bracket|e}} is pronounced as a schwa (called ''\"vocal neutra\"'', 'neutral vowel'). A stressed schwa can occur in the Catalan dialects spoken in the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], as in ''m\u0103tur\u0103'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0259tur\u0259]}} ('broom').\n\nIn [[European Portuguese|European]] and some [[Portuguese language in Africa|African]] dialects of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the schwa occurs in many unstressed syllables that end in {{angle bracket|e}}, such as ''noite'' ('night'), ''tarde'' ('afternoon'), ''p\u00eassego'' ('peach'), and ''pecado'' ('sin'). However, that is rare in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] except in such areas as [[Curitiba]] in [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]]{{cn| date= October 2018}}).\n\nIn [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], a final, unstressed {{angle bracket|a}}, and unstressed {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|o}} are pronounced as a schwa: ''p\u00eczza'' ('pizza'), ''semm\u00e0na'' ('week'), '' purtu\u00e0llo'' ('orange').\n\nThe inherent vowel in the [[Devanagari]] script, an [[abugida]] used to write [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Sanskrit]] is a schwa, written {{angle bracket|\u0905}} either in isolation or word-initially.\n\nOther characters used to represent this sound include {{angle bracket|\u0568}} in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], {{angle bracket|\u0103}} in Romanian, and {{angle bracket|\u00eb}} in Albanian. In Bulgarian [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], the letter {{angle bracket|[[yer|\u044a]]}}, which has a very different orthographic function in Modern Russian, is used.\n\nIn languages such as [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] there is no such sound that would resemble the \"schwa\" characteristics.\n\nIn [[Korean language|Korean]], the letter (or rather [[Hangul#jamo|jamo]]) is used, but it may also represent a \"null\" vowel used in the transcription of foreign consonant clusters, when it may be deleted. In most Sanskrit-based languages, the schwa {{angle bracket|[[devanagari|\u0905]]}} is the implied vowel after every consonant and so has no didactic marks. For example, in Hindi, the character \u0915 is pronounced \"k\u0259\" without marking, but \u0915\u0947 is pronounced \"ke\" (pronounced \"kay\") with a marking.\n\nA subscript small schwa (\u2094) is used in [[Indo-European studies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04191-n2788-laryngeals.pdf|title=L2/04-191: Proposal to encode six Indo-Europeanist phonetic characters in the UCS|date=2004-06-07|first1=Deborah|last1=Anderson|first2=Michael|last2=Everson}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===Albanian===\nIn Albanian, schwa is represented by the letter {{angle bracket|[[\u00eb]]}}, which is also one of the letters of the [[Albanian alphabet]], coming right after the letter {{angle bracket|[[e]]}}. It can be stressed like in words ''i \u00ebmb\u00ebl'' {{IPA|/i \u0259mb\u0259l/}} and ''\u00ebnd\u00ebrr'' {{IPA|/\u0259nd\u0259r/}} ('sweet' and 'dream', respectively).\n\n===Armenian===\nIn Armenian, schwa is represented by the letter '''\u0568''' (capital '''\u0538'''). It is occasionally word-initial but usually word-final, as a form of the definite article. Unwritten schwa sounds are also inserted to split initial consonant clusters; for example, \u0573\u0576\u0573\u0572\u0578\u0582\u056f (''\u010dn\u010d\u0142uk'') [t\u0283\u02bc\u0259nt\u0283\u02bc\u0259'\u0281uk] 'sparrow'.\n\n===Azerbaijani===\nIn the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]], the schwa character '''\u0259''' is used, but to represent the '''[[Near-open_front_unrounded_vowel|\u00e6]]''' sound.\n\n===Catalan===\nIn Catalan, schwa is represented by the letters '''a''' or '''e''' in unstressed vowels: \"par'''e'''\" {{IPA|/\u02c8pa\u027e'''\u0259'''/}} (''father''), \"B'''a'''rc'''e'''lon'''a'''\" {{IPA|/b\u0259\u027es\u0259\u02c8lon\u0259/}}. In the Balearic Islands, the sound is sometimes also in stressed vowels, \"p'''e'''r'''a'''\" {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u0259\u027e\u0259/}} (''pear'').\n\n===Dutch===\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the digraph {{angle bracket|ij}} in the suffix ''-lijk'' {{IPA-nl|l\u0259k|}}, as in ''waarschijnlijk'' {{IPA-nl|\u028ba\u02d0r\u02c8sx\u025binl\u0259k|}} ('probably') is pronounced as a schwa. If an {{angle bracket|e}} falls at the ultimate (or penultimate) place before a consonant in Dutch words and is unstressed, it becomes a schwa, as in the verb ending \"-en\" (''lopen'') and the diminutive suffix \"-tje(s)\" (''tafeltje(s)'').\n\n===Korean===\nThe schwa is rarely used in [[Korean phonology]]. It is an alternative form of \u028c. For example, \ud638\ub5a1 (''[[hotteok]]'') [ho.t\u0348\u0259k\u031a].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Madurese ===\nIn [[Madurese language|Madurese]], some words with /a/, usually in nonfinal position, would be pronounced as the schwa. When writing Madurese in its traditional [[abugida]], [[Javanese script|Hanacaraka]], words as such would not be written with a vowel diacritic that denote that it is a schwa. Nowadays, even after the [[Madurese people]] have adopted the [[Latin alphabet]], such writing fashion is still used. \n\nExample -\n\n* \"Jhabah\" (/d\u0292\u0259b\u0259h/) - [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Java Island]]\n* \"sagara\" (/sag\u0259r\u0259/) - sea,ocean\n* \"lajar\" (/l\u0259d\u0292\u0259r/) - to sail\n* \"Sorbaja\" (/sorb\u0259d\u0292\u0259/) - [[Surabaya]]\n* \"Madura\" (/madur\u0259/) - [[Madurese people|Madurese]], [[Madura Island]]\n* \"Bulan\" (/bul\u0259n/) - [[Moon]]\n\n===Malay===\nIn the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] variant, schwa is always unstressed except for [[Jakarta]]-influenced informal Indonesian whose schwa can be stressed. In final closed syllables in the formal register, the vowel is ''a'' (the final syllable is usually the second syllable since most Indonesian root words consist of two syllables). In some cases, the vowel ''a'' is pronounced as a stressed schwa (only when the vowel ''a'' is located between two consonants in a syllable), but never in formal speech:\n\n*datang (=come), pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0251\u02d0\u02c8t\u028c\u014b]}}, and often written as ''dateng'' in informal writing.\n*kental (=viscous), pronounced {{IPA|[k\u0259n\u02c8t\u028cl]}}.\n*hitam (=black), pronounced {{IPA|[hi\u02c8t\u028cm]}}, written as ''item'' in informal language.\n*dalam (=deep, in), pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0251\u02d0\u02c8l\u028cm]}}, often written as ''dalem''.\n*malam (=night), pronounced {{IPA|[m\u028c\u02c8l\u028cm]}}, written as ''malem'' in informal language.\n\nIndonesian orthography formerly used unmarked {{angle bracket|e}} only for the schwa sound, and the full vowel /e/ was written {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}. Malaysian orthography, on the other hand, formerly indicated the schwa with {{angle bracket|\u0115}} (called ''p\u0115p\u0115t''), and unmarked {{angle bracket|e}} stood for /e/.\n\nIn the 1972 spelling reform that unified Indonesian and Malaysian spelling conventions (''[[Differences between Malay and Indonesian#Orthography|Ejaan yang Disempurnakan]]'', regulated by [[Majlis Bahasa Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia|MABBIM]]), it was agreed to use neither diacritic.<ref>Asmah Haji Omar, {{cite journal|year=1989|title=The Malay Spelling Reform|url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j11/malay.php|url-status=dead|journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society|issue=2|pages=9\u201313|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706054017/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j11/malay.php|archivedate=2010-07-06}}</ref> There is no longer an orthographic distinction between /\u0259/ and /e/; both are spelled with an unmarked {{angle bracket|e}}. This means that the pronunciation of any given letter ''e'' in both Indonesian and Malaysian variants is not immediately obvious to the learner and must be learned separately. However, in a number of Indonesian dictionaries and lesson books for foreign learners, the notation is preserved to help learners. For example, the word for 'wheeled vehicle' in Indonesia and Malaysia, which was formerly spelled ''ker\u00e9ta'' in Indonesia and ''k\u0115reta'' in Malaysia, is now spelled ''kereta'' in both countries.\n\nIn Southern Malaysian pronunciation, which is predominant in common Malaysian media, the final letter -''a'' represents schwa, and final ''-ah'' stands for  /a/. The dialect of [[Kedah]] in northern Malaysia, however, pronounces final -''a'' as /a/ also. In loanwords, a nonfinal short /a/ may become schwa in Malay such as ''Mekah'' (<Arabic ''[[Mecca|Makkah]]'', Malay pronunciation {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0259kah]}}).\n\n=== Norwegian ===\nIn Norwegian, the schwa is often found in the last syllable of definite, masculine nouns, as in ''mannen'' {{IPA-no|'m\u0251n\u0259n}} ('the man'), as well as in infinitive verbs like ''bite'' {{IPA-no|\u02c8b\u00ee\u02d0t\u0259}} ('bite').\n\n===Romanian===\nIn Romanian, schwa is represented by the letter [[\u0102]], [[\u0103]], which is considered a letter on its own (the second in the [[Romanian alphabet]]). It can be stressed in words in which it is the only vowel such as \"p\u0103r\" {{IPA|/p\u0259r/}} (''hair'' or ''pear tree'') or \"v\u0103d\" {{IPA|/v\u0259d/}} (''I see''). Some words which also contain other vowels can have the stress on '''\u0103''': \"c\u0103r\u021bile\" {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u0259rt\u0361sile/}} (''the books'') and \"od\u0103i\" {{IPA|/o\u02c8d\u0259j/}} (''rooms'').\n\n=== Serbo-Croatian ===\nIn [[Serbo-Croatian]], schwa is not a phoneme, but it is often colloquially used to pronounce names of consonants. For example, the official name of the letter {{Angle bracket|p}} is pronounced {{IPA|/pe(\u02d0)/}}, but in everyday speech, it is often called {{IPA|/p\u0259/}}.\n\n===Welsh===\nThe schwa is denoted in Welsh by the letter 'y'. It is a very common letter as 'y' is the definite article with 'yr' being the definite article if the following word starts with a vowel.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n==Schwa syncope==\n{{main|Syncope (phonology)}}In phonology, [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] is the process of deleting unstressed sounds, particularly unstressed vowels. Across languages, schwa vowels are commonly deleted in some instances, such as in [[Hindi]], [[North American English]], and [[French language|French]].\n\n===Hindi===\n{{Main|Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages}}\nAlthough the [[Devanagari]] script is used as a standard to write Modern Hindi, the schwa (''\u0259'', sometimes written as ''a'') implicit in each consonant of the script is \"obligatorily deleted\" at the end of words and in certain other contexts.<ref name=\"hyman1988\">{{Citation |title = Language, speech, and mind (Volume 1988, Part 2)|author1=Larry M.

By the 1880s, the police had developed into a nationwide instrument of government control, providing support for local leaders and enforcing [[public morality]]. They acted as general civil administrators, implementing official policies and thereby facilitating unification and modernization. In rural areas especially, the police had great authority and were accorded the same mixture of fear and respect as the village head. Their increasing involvement in political affairs was one of the foundations of the authoritarian state in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe centralized police system steadily acquired responsibilities, until it controlled almost all aspects of daily life, including [[Firefighter|fire prevention]] and mediation of labor disputes. The system regulated [[public health]], business, factories, and construction, and it issued permits and licenses. The [[Peace Preservation Law]] of 1925 gave police the authority to arrest people for \"wrong thoughts\". Special Higher Police ([[Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu|Tokko]]) were created to regulate the content of motion pictures, political meetings, and election campaigns. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[military police]] ([[Kempeitai]]) and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]], operating under their respective services and the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|justice]] and [[Home Ministry (Japan)|home ministries]] aided the civilian police in limiting proscribed political activity. After the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, military police assumed greater authority, leading to friction with their civilian counterparts. After 1937 police directed business activities for the war effort, mobilized labor, and controlled transportation.\n\nAfter [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, [[Occupied Japan|occupation]] authorities in [[World War II]] retained the prewar police structure until a new system was implemented and the [[Japanese diet|Diet]] passed the [[1947 Police Law]]. Contrary to Japanese proposals for a strong, centralized force to deal with postwar unrest, the police system was decentralized. About 1,600 independent municipal forces were established in cities, towns, and villages with 5,000 inhabitants or more, and a [[National Rural Police]] was organized by prefecture. Civilian control was to be ensured by placing the police under the jurisdiction of public safety commissions controlled by the [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|National Public Safety Commission]] in the Office of the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The Home Ministry was abolished and replaced by the less powerful [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], and the police were stripped of their responsibility for fire protection, public health, and other administrative duties.\n\nWhen most of the occupation forces were transferred to [[Korean Peninsula|Korea]] in 1950\u201351 with the [[Korean War]], the 75,000 strong [[National Police Reserve]] (predecessor of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]]) was formed outside the [[#Regular police organizations|Regular police organizations]] to back up the ordinary police during civil disturbances. And pressure mounted for a centralized system more compatible with Japanese political preferences. The 1947 Police Law was amended in 1951 to allow the municipal police of smaller communities to merge with the National Rural Police. Most chose this arrangement, and by 1954 only about 400 cities, towns, and villages still had their own police forces. Under the 1954 amended Police Law, a final restructuring created an even more centralized system in which local forces were organized by prefectures under a [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]].\n\nThe revised Police Law of 1954, still in effect in the 1990s, preserves some strong points of the postwar system, particularly measures ensuring civilian control and political neutrality, while allowing for increased centralization. The National Public Safety Commission system has been retained. State responsibility for maintaining public order has been clarified to include coordination of national and local efforts; centralization of police information, communications, and record keeping facilities; and national standards for training, uniforms, pay, rank, and promotion. Rural and municipal forces were abolished and integrated into prefectural forces, which handled basic police matters. Officials and inspectors in various ministries and agencies continue to exercise special police functions assigned to them in the 1947 Police Law.\n\n===Safety===\nAccording to statistics of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], among the 192 member states of the UN, and among the countries reporting statistics of criminal and criminal justice, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Fifth Survey (1990 - 1994)|url=http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|accessdate=2008-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729012918/http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|archivedate=2009-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Sixth Survey (1995 - 1997)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Sixth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Seventh Survey (1998 - 2000)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Seventh-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Eighth Survey (2001 - 2002)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Eighth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Ninth Survey (2003 - 2004)>Values and Rates per 100,000 Total Population Listed by Country|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Ninth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref> \n\nThe [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration rate]] is very low and Japan ranks 209 out of 223 countries.

By the 1880s, the police had developed into a nationwide instrument of government control, providing support for local leaders and enforcing [[public morality]]. They acted as general civil administrators, implementing official policies and thereby facilitating unification and modernization. In rural areas especially, the police had great authority and were accorded the same mixture of fear and respect as the village head. Their increasing involvement in political affairs was one of the foundations of the authoritarian state in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe centralized police system steadily acquired responsibilities, until it controlled almost all aspects of daily life, including [[Firefighter|fire prevention]] and mediation of labor disputes. The system regulated [[public health]], business, factories, and construction, and it issued permits and licenses. The [[Peace Preservation Law]] of 1925 gave police the authority to arrest people for \"wrong thoughts\". Special Higher Police ([[Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu|Tokko]]) were created to regulate the content of motion pictures, political meetings, and election campaigns. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[military police]] ([[Kempeitai]]) and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]], operating under their respective services and the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|justice]] and [[Home Ministry (Japan)|home ministries]] aided the civilian police in limiting proscribed political activity. After the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, military police assumed greater authority, leading to friction with their civilian counterparts. After 1937 police directed business activities for the war effort, mobilized labor, and controlled transportation.\n\nAfter [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, [[Occupied Japan|occupation]] authorities in [[World War II]] retained the prewar police structure until a new system was implemented and the [[Japanese diet|Diet]] passed the [[1947 Police Law]]. Contrary to Japanese proposals for a strong, centralized force to deal with postwar unrest, the police system was decentralized. About 1,600 independent municipal forces were established in cities, towns, and villages with 5,000 inhabitants or more, and a [[National Rural Police]] was organized by prefecture. Civilian control was to be ensured by placing the police under the jurisdiction of public safety commissions controlled by the [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|National Public Safety Commission]] in the Office of the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The Home Ministry was abolished and replaced by the less powerful [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], and the police were stripped of their responsibility for fire protection, public health, and other administrative duties.\n\nWhen most of the occupation forces were transferred to [[Korean Peninsula|Korea]] in 1950\u201351 with the [[Korean War]], the 75,000 strong [[National Police Reserve]] (predecessor of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]]) was formed outside the [[#Regular police organizations|Regular police organizations]] to back up the ordinary police during civil disturbances. And pressure mounted for a centralized system more compatible with Japanese political preferences. The 1947 Police Law was amended in 1951 to allow the municipal police of smaller communities to merge with the National Rural Police. Most chose this arrangement, and by 1954 only about 400 cities, towns, and villages still had their own police forces. Under the 1954 amended Police Law, a final restructuring created an even more centralized system in which local forces were organized by prefectures under a [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]].\n\nThe revised Police Law of 1954, still in effect in the 1990s, preserves some strong points of the postwar system, particularly measures ensuring civilian control and political neutrality, while allowing for increased centralization. The National Public Safety Commission system has been retained. State responsibility for maintaining public order has been clarified to include coordination of national and local efforts; centralization of police information, communications, and record keeping facilities; and national standards for training, uniforms, pay, rank, and promotion. Rural and municipal forces were abolished and integrated into prefectural forces, which handled basic police matters. Officials and inspectors in various ministries and agencies continue to exercise special police functions assigned to them in the 1947 Police Law.\n\n===Safety===\nAccording to statistics of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], among the 192 member states of the UN, and among the countries reporting statistics of criminal and criminal justice, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Fifth Survey (1990 - 1994)|url=http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|accessdate=2008-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729012918/http://www.uncjin.org/Statistics/WCTS/WCTS5/wcts5.html|archivedate=2009-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Sixth Survey (1995 - 1997)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Sixth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Seventh Survey (1998 - 2000)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Seventh-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Eighth Survey (2001 - 2002)>Sorted by variable|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Eighth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=UNODC|title=Data and Analysis>Crime surveys>The periodic United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems>Ninth Survey (2003 - 2004)>Values and Rates per 100,000 Total Population Listed by Country|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Ninth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html|accessdate=2008-08-26 }}</ref> \n\nThe [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration rate]] is very low and Japan ranks 209 out of 223 countries.

The Tornjak is an old breed first mentioned in the 11th then 14th century. Descriptions of the Tornjak were found in the writings of Peter Horvat, [[bishop of \u0110akovo]], [[Croatia]], which date back to the year 1374, those descriptions were also found in the writings of Peter Luki\u0107, [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Diocese of \u0110akovo|\u0110akovo diocese]], which were written in 1752. To this day, these dogs are called ''Tora\u0161i'' (Torashi) in the surroundings of the city of [[Sinj]] and on the [[Kame\u0161nica (mountain)|Kame\u0161nica mountain]], whereas the shepherds of the [[Dinara]]-mountains call them ''Dinarci''. Descriptions of Tornjaks from these documents are the very same as they are today, except for the name of the breed, which was ''Bosanski Ov\u010dar'', meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhtornjak.com/en/|title=TORNJAK - Bosnian shepherd dog|website=Bhtornjak.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> It was also called the ''Hrvatski pas planinac'', meaning Croatian mountain dog. The dogs in these documents were described entirely equal (in respect to their function and their appearance) as they are today: a protective guarding dog which keeps and watches all that their owners ask them, but is highly intelligent and selectively bred to be without excessive aggression. They are also pleasant toward strangers that they meet outside of their domain.\n\nIt is considered that the dogs of the Tornjak's type have existed in the area around and in [[Dinarides]] ([[Dinaric Alps]]), especially in the region around [[Vla\u0161i\u0107 (Bosnian mountain)|Vla\u0161i\u0107]] (close to the city of [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) as a central area of the region since the [[Roman time]]s. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used their dogs for war and as guardian dogs, as well as for fighting in the arena. Although the Tornjak is a very old breed, with the vanishing of nomadic sheep herding, the Tornjak also gradually vanished. In the early 1970s, a group of local [[Cynology|cynologists]] began to collect the remaining dogs which best corresponded to the old writings about the breed.<ref name=\"123dog.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.123dog.net/servlets/gateway/user/GalleryNews.jsp/id/256/typeid/3002/jlang/en/dogs.html|title=Tornjak - A Breed Resurrected - Dogs and dog breeds and dog pictures|website=123dog.net|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Tornjaks were first imported to the UK in 2013 with intentions of working towards UK Kennel Club Recognition.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:Bosnian and Herzegovinian - Croatian Shepherd Dog aka Tornjak.jpg|thumb|left|A female Tornjak of Croatian breeding participating in the European Winner Show 2008 in Budapest, Hungary.]]\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Tornjak is a large and powerful dog, with well proportioned, almost square-bodied features and agile movements. The dog's bones are not light, but nevertheless not heavy nor coarse. The bodies of these dogs are strong and well built, with harmonious and dignified movements, possessing a self-confident, serious and calm disposition. In general the Tornjak is a long-coated dog with short hair over the face and legs. The hair is distinctively long and abundant over the neck (mane), and on the back of the upper thighs (breeches). The tail is especially well feathered, and carried like a flag while the dog moves. The coat is very dense and can not be parted.\n\nAs a rule, the Tornjak is parti-colored, with white being the dominant ground color. White markings are most commonly found around the neck, over the head and along the legs. The patches can be any color. Similar to other livestock guardian dogs, the distinct markings served an utilitarian purpose, helping shepherds distinguish their dogs from both sheep and wolves.\n\n;Temperament\n\nTornjak has a calm temperament. A typical adult Tornjak is very calm, peaceful, at first sight an indifferent animal, but when the situation demands it, it is a vigilant and very alert watchdog. The character is equal to the temperament; they are not nervous nor aggressive.  In general, they are very tough, not too demanding, sturdy dogs. With their human family they are very emotional. When living in a pack they are highly social animals, without fighting between the pack members. Towards strangers or other animals, as a rule, Tornjak is not overly aggressive. But when the situation calls upon it, Tornjak is quite decisive and it can without any consideration attack even much stronger rivals. Shepherds used to say that a Tornjak that guards the flock is a fair match to two wolves, and that a couple of Tornjaks will confront and chase away a bear. In these situations, Tornjaks can be very tenacious.[[File:ToroTornjak.JPG|thumb|right|alt=an example of shorter coat in the Summer.|The coat is shorter in the Summer.]]\n\n==Activities==\nTornjak's exercise levels are usually not demanding, especially in the first 9\u201312 months (during the last intensive growth period). After that they can exercise as much as possible. They prefer long walks without a leash and a lot of playing with other dogs. They will also be just as satisfied with only a 20-minute walk if its owner is in a hurry. Tornjaks learn quickly and do not forget easily; they happily perform tasks and are therefore easy to train. Strong and hardy, during the snowy winter nights, these dogs lie on the ground and often get covered with snow without freezing due to their thick coats. They are primarily used for herding and protection of livestock.\n\n==Care==\nTornjak is not recommended for apartment life. They need space and will do best with at least a large yard. Because its thick coat protects it so well it can happily cope with living outdoors provided it has proper shelter. This breed is best suited to a family with lots of space surrounding the home where it can attend to its own exercise needs.\n\nTornjak is a very healthy breed, but because they were very poorly fed in their past, they now do not need much protein in their food. For feeding Tornjaks a low protein diet is suitable. A high protein diet can lead to the development of coat problems. Climbing up and down stairs the first six months can ruin hock joints or lead to [[hip dysplasia (canine)]].\n\nTornjak needs early socialization. Early experiences (before 9 months of age) has a very significant effect throughout the dog's life. They need to be confronted with all potentially fearful stimuli as early as possible in order to avoid later fear reactions.  Traffic noise, big trucks and buses will provoke fear reactions in adulthood if the Tornjak has not previously faced these situations as a puppy. In this early age all Tornjak puppies have to meet as many unknown people as possible, and also other animals, dogs, and pets especially, for developing a good and stable behavior as an adult.\n\n==Ban==\n\nThe dog is banned in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk:443/english/ImportExport/Travelling_with_pet_animals/Pages/The-Danish-dog-legislation.aspx|title=Danish Legislation on Dogs|website=www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Tornjak}}\n<!--Editors: breed registry, club, rescue, and kennel information links are placed on DMOZ, not here-->\n* [http://www.bhtornjak.com/ Tornjak Bosnian-Herzegovinian website]\n* [http://tornjak.pedigre.net/ Tornjak online pedigree database]\n* [http://www.tornjakuk.webs.com/ Tornjak UK website]\n\n{{Croatian dogs}}\n{{Livestock guardians}}\n\n[[Category:FCI breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Livestock guardian dogs]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox Dogbreed \n| image = Bosniantornjak.jpg\n| image_caption = Tornjak\n| name = Tornjak\n| altname = Bosnian and Herzegovinian - Croatian Shepherd Dog (FCI)\n| country = [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]<br>[[Croatia]]\n| fcigroup= 2\n| fcisection= 2.2 Molossian: Mountain type\n| fcinum= 355\n| fcistd= http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/355g02-en.pdf\n| akcfss = yes\n| akcgroup = [[Foundation Stock Service Program|FSS]]\n| akcstd = \n| ukcgroup = [[Guardian Dog Group|Guardian Dog]]\n| ukcstd = http://www.ukcdogs.com/Web.nsf/Breeds/GuardianDog/Tornjak\n| note = \n}}\n\nThe '''Tornjak''' ({{IPA-sh|tor\u0272\u00e2k|pron}}), also known as Bosnian Herzegovinian - Croatian Shepherd dog, is a [[livestock guardian dog]] native to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]].<ref name=\"FCITornjak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/en/nomenclature/BOSNIAN-AND-HERZEGOVINIAN-CROATIAN-SHEPHERD-DOG-355.html|title=Tornjak|publisher=FCI|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> The name comes from the local word for a [[sheep]] [[Pen (enclosure)|pen]], \"tor\".
