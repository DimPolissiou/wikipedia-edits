The policy has been credited with reversing Norway's trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to \u00a3100&nbsp;billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to \"work through what is going to happen with their children\", which has \"a very big effect on their thinking\". \"Many of them think again about what they are going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently,\" he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |title=IDS backs shock courses to stop couples splitting up |date=28 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012357/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |archive-date=6 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuncan Smith said in February 2011 that it was \"absurd and damaging\" for ministers not to extol the benefits of marriage for fear of stigmatising those who choose not to marry. Duncan Smith said: \"We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children. There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage.\" He added that \"The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to see is the human cost \u2013 the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |title=Couples should be encouraged to marry, says Iain Duncan Smith |date=8 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211084819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, Duncan Smith signalled his support for [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] on the basis that it would promote stability in relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|title=Iain Duncan Smith defies Catholic Church to back marriage for gay couples|work=PinkNews|date=28 April 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429151542/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|archive-date=29 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Views on immigration===\nDuncan Smith has said that tighter immigration controls are vital if Britain is to avoid \"losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness\". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with \"something to offer\" should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. According to ''The Daily Telegraph'''s analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron \"that a 'slack' attitude to immigration will result in the Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants\". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as \"an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain\". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed \"a level playing field\". \"If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people,\" he said.<ref>Andrew Porter, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html Migrants 'take the jobs from young Britons'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827041733/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html |date=27 August 2019 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111104191200/http://www.fundacionfaes.org/record_file/filename/3098/2011_07_01_IAIN_DUNCAN_SMITH.pdf Address by Iain Duncan Smith at the opening session of the FAES campus], fundacionfaes.org; accessed 9 May 2015.</ref>\n\n===Views on social credit===\nDuncan Smith has called for cuts to [[Universal Credit]] to be reversed.

The [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] from 2010 to 2016, he was previously the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2001 to 2003. He was first elected to [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]] \u2013 which he represented until the constituency's abolition in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] \u2013 and he has since represented its successor constituency of [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]].\n\nDuncan Smith was born in [[Edinburgh]] and served in the [[Scots Guards]] from 1975 to 1981, seeing tours in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Rhodesia]]. He joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1981, and eventually succeeded [[William Hague]] as Conservative Leader in 2001; he won the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] partly owing to the support of [[Margaret Thatcher]] for his [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] beliefs. Duncan Smith was the first [[Catholic church|Catholic]] to serve as a Conservative Leader, and the first Conservative leader to be born in Scotland since [[Arthur Balfour]]. In 2010, ''[[The Tablet]]'' named him one of Britain's most influential Catholics.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tablet's Top 100 |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313083725/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283 |archive-date=13 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMany Conservative MPs came to consider him incapable of winning an election when he was Conservative Party Leader. In 2003, Conservative MPs passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership; he immediately resigned, and was succeeded by [[Michael Howard]]. Returning to the backbenches, he founded the [[centre-right]] [[Centre for Social Justice]], a [[think tank]] independent of the Conservative Party, and became a published novelist. On 12 May 2010, the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]], appointed Duncan Smith to serve in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]]. He resigned from the Cabinet on 18 March 2016, in opposition to Chancellor [[George Osborne]]'s proposed cuts to disability benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687|title=Iain Duncan Smith quits over planned disability benefit changes|work=BBC News|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418234840/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687|archive-date=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Duncan Smith served as chairman for [[Boris Johnson|Boris Johnson's]] leadership campaign, resulting in an emphatic win, with over 50% of MPs and 66% of the Conservative membership voting for Johnson to become the next Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister.\n\n==Early life==\nDuncan Smith was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of [[W.

Although he was initially viewed as an outsider,  his campaign was bolstered when [[Margaret Thatcher]] publicly gave her support for him.

The policy has been credited with reversing Norway's trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to \u00a3100&nbsp;billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to \"work through what is going to happen with their children\", which has \"a very big effect on their thinking\". \"Many of them think again about what they are going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently,\" he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |title=IDS backs shock courses to stop couples splitting up |date=28 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012357/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |archive-date=6 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuncan Smith said in February 2011 that it was \"absurd and damaging\" for ministers not to extol the benefits of marriage for fear of stigmatising those who choose not to marry. Duncan Smith said: \"We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children. There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage.\" He added that \"The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to see is the human cost \u2013 the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |title=Couples should be encouraged to marry, says Iain Duncan Smith |date=8 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211084819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, Duncan Smith signalled his support for [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] on the basis that it would promote stability in relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|title=Iain Duncan Smith defies Catholic Church to back marriage for gay couples|work=PinkNews|date=28 April 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429151542/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|archive-date=29 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Views on immigration===\nDuncan Smith has said that tighter immigration controls are vital if Britain is to avoid \"losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness\". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with \"something to offer\" should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. According to ''The Daily Telegraph'''s analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron \"that a 'slack' attitude to immigration will result in the Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants\". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as \"an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain\". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed \"a level playing field\". \"If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people,\" he said.<ref>Andrew Porter, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html Migrants 'take the jobs from young Britons'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827041733/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html |date=27 August 2019 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111104191200/http://www.fundacionfaes.org/record_file/filename/3098/2011_07_01_IAIN_DUNCAN_SMITH.pdf Address by Iain Duncan Smith at the opening session of the FAES campus], fundacionfaes.org; accessed 9 May 2015.</ref>\n\n===Views on social credit===\nDuncan Smith has called for cuts to [[Universal Credit]] to be reversed.

Since the track didn't do well on [[United States|U.S.]] radio, most fans think more radio-friendly songs from the album, like \"[[Unconditional Love (Cyndi Lauper song)|Unconditional Love]]\", would have done better as the commercially released second single.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"My First Night Without You\", released in 1989, was one of the first to be closed-captioned for the hearing impaired.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1989-cyndi-laupers-video-for-my-first-night-without/ | title=1989 \u2013 Cyndi Lauper\u2019s video for \"My First Night Without\u2026 | author=This Day in Rock | accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1989)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[ARIA Charts|Australian ARIA Singles Chart]]<ref>http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Cyndi+Lauper&titel=My+First+Night+Without+You&cat=s</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Belgium]] (Ultratop Wallonia)<ref>http://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/4667/Cyndi-Lauper-My-First-Night-Without-You</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Chilean Singles Chart<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031128202852/http://www.cyndilauper.com/single_det.php?shname=mfnwy</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|French Singles Chart]]<ref>http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Cyndi+Lauper&titel=My+First+Night+Without+You&cat=s</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|46\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/21311/CYNDI%20LAUPER/</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|53\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>http://www.billboard.com/artist/299876/cyndi+lauper/chart?f=379</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|62\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''Cash Box'' Top 100 Singles\n|align=\"center\"|55\n|}\n\n==Track listing==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;7\" / Cassette / Europe 3\" CD single / Japan 3\" CD single\n# \"My First Night Without You\" (edited remix) \u2013 2:58\n# \"Unabbreviated Love\" \u2013 4:18\n\n;UK Limited Edition 7\" (with poster)\n# \"My First Night Without You\" (edited remix) \u2013 2:58\n# \"True Colors\" \u2013 3:47\n\n;12\" / Europe 5\" CD maxi-single\n# \"My First Night Without You\" (edited remix) \u2013 2:58\n# \"Unabbreviated Love\" \u2013 4:18\n# \"True Colors\" \u2013 3:46\n\n{{col-2}}\n;UK 12\" / UK 5\" CD single\n# \"My First Night Without You\" (edited remix) \u2013 2:58\n# \"Unabbreviated Love\" \u2013 4:18\n# \"True Colors\" \u2013 3:47\n# \"All Through the Night\" \u2013 4:32\n\n;UK Limited Edition Picture Disc CD single\n# \"My First Night Without You\" (edited remix) \u2013 2:58\n# \"Unabbreviated Love\" \u2013 4:18\n# \"Iko Iko\" \u2013 2:05\n# \"When You Were Mine\" \u2013 5:01\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MetroLyrics song|cyndi-lauper|my-first-night-without-you}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n\n{{Cyndi Lauper singles}}\n\n[[Category:1989 songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Tom Kelly (musician)]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Billy Steinberg]]\n[[Category:Cyndi Lauper songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Cyndi Lauper]]\n[[Category:Epic Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs about heartache]]\n[[Category:Songs about loneliness]]\n[[Category:1980s ballads]]\n[[Category:Pop ballads]]\n", "name_user": "And Leave", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChart performance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_First_Night_Without_You"}
